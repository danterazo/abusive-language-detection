Here are the three scholars' descriptions of what Rawat wanted to do as he grew older -
1. not allow others to dictate the direction and management of the movement.(Geaves)
2. manifest his own vision of development and growth. (Downton)
3. decide what direction the movement should take.(Melton)

and this desire caused

1. a deep rift in Prem Rawat’s family.(Geaves)
2. he had to encroach on his mother's territory and, given the fact that she was accustomed to having control, a fight was inevitable.(Downton)
3. a split between Maharaji and his family, ostensibly caused by his mother's inability to accept Maharaji's marriage to an American follower(Melton)

So how about """"As Rawat turned 16, his desire to decide to dictate the direction of the movement led to split with his mother. His marriage to an American follower in 1974 caused a permanent rift and his eldest brother gained control of Indian DLM in a lawsuit whilst Rawat retained control of Western DLM.  """,0
"International Symposium on Dr Axel Munthe

The second  international symposium on Dr Axel Munthe’s  life and work   will be held  on Saturday 13th of September at Hildasholm, Leksand, Sweden. 

From the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.

The eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”

Other distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.

When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.

In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).

In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.

During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.

Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.

The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.

Hildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.

 Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peaceful
waters and comprises Swedish, English and Italian furniture and paintings
from the 17th, 18th and 19th century Europe. It is still used by the family
while also being opened as a museum for the public during the summer
months. 

The gardens were created by Axel’s wife Hilda on the promontories
and in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well ordered
English garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment.

"I'm pretty sure that it's fine, if the rates are understood to be per year (or some other finite period), as is usually the case in economics.  After a year in the bank, an amount of money M becomes M*(1+i), where i is the nominal interest rate.  You can also write this as M*(1+r)*(1+p), where r is the real interest rate and p is the rate of inflation.  Then you get the first equality for r.

"""The Starting Point is near Thebes ==

In Exodus Ramesses was one of a pair of treasure cities or emporia and the first station of the Exodus. In the story there are two treasure cities; Pithom in the Delta and Ra mes ses at Thebes, Egypt.

Exodus 1:7-14  And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Ramesses. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. 

If Ancient Egypt isn't something you have studied intensively there may be some confusion about what is a treasure city. A treasure city or emporia is a port where foreign traders can bring their goods through customs. 

In the 19th century archaeologists made speculations about San el-Hagar or Pi-Ramesses and Tell el-maskhuta or Pi-Athom  being the places mentioned in the story of the Exodus. These have since been corrected by trained Egyptologists, but the myths have lived on among """"biblical archaeologists"""" and laypeople. 

See: Baines and Malek,1987, Atlas of Ancient Egypt, Equinox, ISBN 0-87196-334-5 Pi-Riamsese 166,175,177, removal of capital to, 46, 84, 166.

Under San el-Hagar
...the temple is a mass of inscribed and decorated blocks, columns, obelisks and statues of various dates, some of them even bearing the names of rulers of the old and middle kingdoms (Khufu, Khepren, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II, Senwosret I), However the majority of the inscribed monuments are connected with Ramesses II and this led P. Monet, the greatest expert on the Tanis monuments  to believe this was the site of the ancient Pi-Ramesses, the delta capital of the Ramesids. Nevertheless none of the buildings so far excavated can be shown to have been built before the reign of Pausanes I of the Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt and the inescapable conclusion therefore is that all the ramessid and earlier monuments must have been brought from other places.

Under Tell el-maskhuta
In 1883 E. Neville excavated a large brick built enclosure (some 210 x 210 m) with a badly damaged temple at Tell el-maskhuta, in wadi tumilat. (In the late period a canal through this wadi enabled  ships to sail from the Nile into the Red Sea) Most scholars, though not all, identify Tell el-maskhuta with ancient Egyptian Tjeku and Pithom, (probably from per-Atum, The """"Domain of Athom"""") of the Exodus and the capital of the Eighth Lower Egyptian nome.

Pithom is an ancient city in Egypts delta. Its mentioned in Exodus as a treasure city in the same breath as Ramesses. You would have to know that from the Hyksos period onward there are emporia in both the delta and Thebes. In the delta cities like Sais served as """"Treasure cities"""" business or banking centers. At Thebes Elim on the Red Sea also served as a business or banking centers for the Red Sea trade in Frankincense, Myhr, Bitumen and perfumes and ointments such as ben jamin or juniper oil used at Karnak's mortuary temples.

Pithom and Rameses are located at opposite ends of the kingdom. Pi-Athom is an ancient nome capital (see below) in the delta. 

Ra mes ses means literally (Ra=sun), (mes=birth), (ses= to guard or observe), the place of observing the birth of the sun, the dawn in the east. During the entire history of Egypt the Red Sea was an important source of the materials used in the mortuary at Karnak. Karnak was where Moses would have gone to get the bones of Joseph

Exodus 13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. 

Following the stations list, the Exodus crosses the Red Sea between Elim and Elat. Elim, the sixth station, is Thebes Red Sea port.",0

Well, Guy, I was going to ask you why, if I have been blocked, what your interest was in it, and why there was no notice to that effect by the blocking administrator here on my talk page.

But then when I come to post that, I happen to glance at the jumble of a signature there and see that the """"Guy"""" who was posting on my talk page was the same as the """"JzG"""" who appears in my block log.

So then the question becomes, why the third-person passive-voice nonsense?  What's this """"Right now you have a block of 7 days"""" stuff, as if you are informing me of someone else's actions?  You blocked me.  Just say soespecially if you are going to twiddle with your user name so that what I see in the notice is something different from what I see in my block log.  I almost mistook you for some well-intentioned soul who thought that he was going to offer to help out in some unspecified way in my reeducation.  Some helpful, innocent bystander with a """"Help!"""" button in his signature for some reason or anther.

To say that one cannot raise an issue and claim, on a forum for making such complaints about the actions of editors such as WP:ANI, that an editor's actions have been rude and inconsiderate (or even aggressive, your word, if I had said that), is ludicrous.  It is totally contrary to all sense of fairness and due process, on Wikipedia or anywhere else. Raising such an issue is clearly not a violation of WP:CIVIL, whether or not in your subjective opinion  you can find some excuse for that actionbut you haven't even bothered to try to do that.

But you also seem to have entirely missed the point of the issue I raised at WP:ANI.  Rlevse's actions in disrupting the process are not wrong becasue he was incidentally rude and inconsiderate to me in doing so; they are wrong because they are bad for Wikipedia.  They are wrong because they corrupt the process of the various dispute resolution network we have.  They would have been wrong if he had been pleasant and nice to me and had tried to discuss things with me and actually accomplish something, rather than blocking me out of the blue.  The fact that he was rude and inconsiderate is irrelevant to that issue.  I even pointed that out there, and don't understand how you could have missed that.

You are instead assuming bad faith on my part, in addition to not paying any attention to the actual issues raised there.  You have turned a blind eye to the issue that was raised, just because, for whatever reasonand I don't have a clue what it isyou have taken a dislike to me. Not a good foundation for any discussion.

But then, you aren't really interested in discussion, are you?  No more so than Rlevse.  No, in fact, much less sohe didn't block me to keep me from responding to anything he had said. He merely didn't say anything, anywhere. You, OTOH, have blocked me specifically to stop me from addressing your response or anyone else's on the WP:ANI discussion, and the subsequent one on WP:AN.

The disruption of WQA was done to give an advantage in content disputes to User:Greg L, who had already had a Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts on his own actions at Kilogram, filed by User:Enuja in [this back on 1 September, before I ever got involved in that discussion there.  The issues raised then have continued almost unabated or even in a worsening manner, with a changing cast of characters other than the constant Greg L involvement, and remain largely unresolved.

If you have the time then please could you review it and see if the NPOV tag can now be removed. I'm about to add a citations tag! Thanks -

 Burnley 

I've reverted your change to Burnley as it was obvious vandalism, which seems odd for a user of your experience. Are we in a bad mood today?   

Thanks for reverting that back again. FYI I’ve not decided that all geographic articles should list any football clubs in the area in the lead section. However, it does seem to be customary to mention the most notable things about the place. As far as I am aware the only reason the average person alive today would even know of Burnley’s existence is Burnley FC. It was in a nice sentence about what the town was probably most famous for, but someone decided to ‘improve’ it.   

 Notification: changes to """"Mark my edits as minor by default"""" preference 

Hello there. This is an automated message to tell you about the gradual phasing out of the preference entitled """"Mark all edits minor by default"""", which you currently have (or very recently had) enabled.

On 13 March 2011, this preference was hidden from the user preferences screen as part of efforts to prevent its accidental misuse (consensus discussion, guidelines for use at WP:MINOR). This had the effect of locking users in to their existing preference, which, in your case, was true. To complete the process, your preference will automatically be changed to false in the next few days. This does not require any intervention on your part and all users will still be able to manually mark their edits as being minor in the usual way. 

For well-established users such as yourself there is '''[[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_78#Preference_to_mark_all_edits_minor_by_def",0

He has not only made a personal attack of deletion on a very important article outlining the history of the show """"Joppa,"""" which met various notable requirements, but he is now going so far as to continually eliminate all semblences of the reference to """"Joppa"""" on the general """"Joppa"""" article on wikipedia. This show is an international phenomenon. It is THE refenced site when Joppa is typed into Google, and has had various features on both MySpace and iTunes.

Please do not misrepresent the history of this article, User:DianaW.

As anyone can easily ascertain by studying this article's history, and as you well know, I was only the last of several editors to write, maintain, or modify that section, without removing it. The others who worked on it  who outnumbered you and your confederates  either didn't feel like wasting their time on a flame war with your group, or were unaware of your vandalous campaign. So much for your mythic statement about """"community opinion."""" (The term for the rhetorical dodge in which one claims  popular support for an opinion, is """"bandwagoning."""" There is probably a separate term for the parallel strategy of portraying dissenters as lone cranks, but I don't know it offhand.)

By the way, when I thought about the actual event, as opposed to your group's flame war against anyone seeking to report it, the notion that the incident had no racial significance became ever more ludicrous. First, because you would never have denied the racial significance of a white-on-black attack, and secondly because I have no doubt that the attackers expressly targeted Gordimer because of her race. As anyone who follows life in South Africa knows, such daily race-based attacks, and official indifference towards them, are a part of the institutionalized fabric of that nation's life. People who oppose racism seek to publicize such systemic racial violence. Unfortunately, there are quite a few folks at Wikipedia who seek to suppress all knowledge of black racial violence.

"You are talking nonsense again. The reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists. Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source.

Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.",1

"""I've included a passage of the bible on my user page. I want it to open the page, and will keep it here, because I feel it acentuates the writing that follows.

so, without any further ado, here is some biblical goodness.

THE BEST THINGS HAVE BEEN CULMINATED 
Zeal to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured 
by others, deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold entertainment in the world.  It is welcomed 
with suspicion instead of love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole left for cavil to enter, (and 
cavil, if it do not find a hole, will make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned.  This will easily 
be granted by as many as know story, or have any experience.  For, was there ever any-projected, that savoured any way of 
newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of gainsaying, or opposition?  A man would think that Civility, 
wholesome Laws, learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we speak of no more things of this kind) 
should be as safe as a Sanctuary, and out of shot, as they say, that no man would lift up the heel, no, nor dog move his 
tongue against the motioners of them. For by the first, we are distinguished from brute beasts lead with sensuality; By the 
second, we are bridled and restrained from outrageous behaviour, and from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by 
violence; By the third, we are enabled to inform and reform others, by the light and feeling that we have attained unto 
ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth being brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our differences than by 
writings which are endless; And lastly, that the Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and 
conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing 
fathers and mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon their breasts (and upon whose breasts 
again themselves do hang to receive the Spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and support fit for their estates. 
Thus it is apparent, that these things which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore, that none, either without 
absurdity can speak against them, or without note of wickedness can spurn against them. 
Yet for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [Anacharsis with others] have been brought to untimely death for 
none other fault, but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and discipline; and that in some Commonwealths 
[e.g. Locri] it was made a capital crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an old, though the 
same were most pernicious; And that certain [Cato the elder], which would be counted pillars of the State, and patterns of 
Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way to good Letters and refined speech, but bare 
themselves as averse from them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; And fourthly, that he was no babe, but a great clerk 
[Gregory the Divine], that gave forth (and in writing to remain to posterity) in passion peradventure, but yet he gave forth, 
that he had not seen any profit to come by any Synod, or meeting of the Clergy, but rather the contrary; And lastly, against 
Church-maintenance and allowance, in such sort, as the Ambassadors and messengers of the great King of Kings should be 
furnished, it is not unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better by the reporter himself [Nauclerus], 
though superstitious) was devised; Namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of Christianity in the Church of 
Rome, then a true Church, were liberally endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying:  Now is poison poured 
down into the Church, etc.  Thus not only as oft as we speak, as one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or 
consequence, we subject ourselves to everyone’s censure, and happy is he that is least tossed upon tongues; for utterly to 
escape the snatch of them it is impossible.  If any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of the meaner sort only, and 
that Princes are privileged by their high estate, he is deceived.  """"As the sword devoureth as well one as the other,"""" as it is in 
Samuel [2 Sam 11:25], nay as the great Commander charged his soldiers in a certain battle, to strike at no part of the enemy,

Dear C.Fred, this is ridiculous. I'm just conveying a fact, and Wikipedia is blocking me as soon as I do. I'm like the boy that states the fact that the emperor is naked, and you're among the public that tells him to be quiet. Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me? Anything that isn't right on the point? Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease. Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded. It is ridiculous, ridiculous... 

I thus contest being blocked for telling the truth. I argue that if telling the truth in itself is a reason for being blocked, then Wikipedia can certainly not be allocated to the category 'encyclopedia', since the definition of this concept surely must include telling the truth (to the best of its ability). If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the """"explanation"""" of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make """"heads and tails"""" of.

Thanks on improving the NPOV of An Inconvenient Truth
Thanks for rebalancing the NPOV equilibrium of this article.  You have achieved by adding rebuttals within the science section in homeopathic doses what I could not by being I gather too straightforward.  I contributed a huge amount of research that was immediately taken out by MastCell.  I just gave up and placed a NPOV tag on this one-sided article at the time.  The tag lasted no more than 2 hours, as it was promptly removed by ILike2BeAnonymous (who is deemed by Wikipedia to be a saint as he apparently as protected many articles against vandalism).  But, ILike2BeAnonymous removed the NPOV tag without making a single contribution to rebalance the NPOV equilibrium.  I gather he thought my tag amounted to vandalism.  Finally, you courageously stepped in.  As you can see per the Discussion history you must be the third or fourth editor who is taking a rebutting balanced stand towards this article.  Of this group, I congratulate you for being so far the most successful.  

If I may, I would encourage you to do even just a bit more.  An Inconvenient Truth's main message is that because of anthropogenic CO2 emission temperatures will rise by the end of the century leading to a probable (entire) melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps leading to sea level rise of 20 to 40 feet submerging our seashore civilization as we know it.  The slides showing what such a sea level rise looks like (maps of cities, states, countries) are pretty dramatic.  But, they have absolutely no scientific bearing.  The IPCC forecasts a sea level rise ranges from several inches inches to just 3 feet in the worst case scenario.  I think this is a critical balancing point to insert within the science section of the article.  I have tried, and got censored immediately.

On the same subject, I am glad you came across the pretty impressive document """"A Skeptic's Guide to an Inconvenient Truth.""""  It is incredibly well researched and referenced.  By the end, there is hardly a page of the book or slide of the movie that is not effectively rebutted by data based scientific studies.  Keep up the good work. """,0

Which reminds me of an old itch, the scandalous contrast between fact and opinion in this encyclopedia.

 Edit disagreements  

Where are you getting the figure range for '300-3000' from? I couldn't find these figures in any of the sources you cited, unless you're estimating based on predictions from the article.
Abu Omar al-Shishani is not the chief in command of both Iraq and Syria. This is ridiculous. I don't know why so many people believe this. I suspect it might be becuase he is so prevalent in the IS propaganda that he is somehow the Islamic State's version of Napoleon Bonaparte. I cannot find any reputable source claiming he is anything more than a field commander in northern Syria. He doesn't even feature in any IS leadership hierarchies, which are almost exclusively staffed by Iraqis who have been in the organisations since the early-mid 2000's. When the former commander of the IS Military Council passed away in June 2014 (Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi), Iraqi secutyi forces found some memory sticks and a laptop containing the following leadership information currently pieced together by western analysts. Note how al-Shishani doesn't feature in any of them, save one which turned out to be incorrect. Here they are: , , . Here is the false one which showed al-Shishani succeeding al-Bilawi as the IS military chief of the Military Shura: . However, it was Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another IS Iraqi commander who had been in the organisation years before al-Shishani had joined who succeeded al-Bilawi as the Chief of the Military Shura. He is shown in the graph as Adnan Latif Hamid al-Sweidawi which is his real name. You never see the upper echelons of the IS hierarchy, the ones who actually control everything. They are not shown in IS propaganda. They are clandestine, mysterious, shadowy figures. Only the pawns are revealed.
You keep stating that Jamaat-ul-Ahrar have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. This is just not true. You might get this impression becuase they broke away from the TTP or the Pakistani Taliban, which swear allegiance to the head of the Afghan Taliban Mullah Omar. But the spokesperson for Jamaat-ul-Ahrar stated that they pledged allegiance to the Taliban leader . The leader of Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Omar Khalid has strong ties to Ayman al-Zawahiri and Al-Qaeda, a nemesis to the Islamic State. 
You state that Abu Sayyaf have sworn allegiance to the Islamic State, however, the man who swore allegiance to them is not the groups leader, so it is unclear whether or not he is representing Abu Sayyaf or a splinter faction. 
You write that Ansar al-Islam is an Al-Qaeda affiliate, but I can find little to no proof affirming this position. The leadership of Ansar al-Islam have rejected the notion that they swear allegiance to al-Qaeda, despite collaborating with their affiliates, such as the al-Nusra Front.U.S. terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna in January 2003 however disagreed with Krekar and affirmed links of Ansar with al-Qaeda: “Ansar al-Islam has links with al-Qaeda – in fact it is an associate group of al-Qaeda”.]. The U.S Defense Intelligence Agency seemed to have affirmed this when they wrote """"Ansar al-Islam is an independent organization that receives assistance from al-Qaeda, but is not a branch of the group.""""DIA, Special Analysis, July 31, 2002, cited in Postwar Findings about Iraq's WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How they Compare with Prewar Assessments, pg. 71.""",0
"""""""In fact BJJ despised wrestling up until the UFC."""" This is not true.

the factor of 10 issue is most propably criminal revisionism, like denying holocaust actually happened, one thing all the people here and everywhere else, fails to take a note when comparing dresden to """"similar raids, with firestorm"""" is the fact that great many of the population failed to take any kind of shelter cause they thought it was just a another false alarm, havent practicly ever got a real air raid to the city and what is more the lacking defences, there was no or little FLAK defences and more importantly, the city had no dedicated / proper air raid shelters what so ever cause resources werent spend on these because city wasnt bombed before, so these people claiming 35 000 or less victims dont just have any idea what they are talking about given that the claims for 300 000 victims are propably also false but im pretty sure something like from 100 000 to 200 000 people did actually die, just look at Tokyo, they had a firestorm, and people had no shelters and """"flak"""" and other defenses were ineffective yet it is AGREED that there in single night, more than 200 000 souls lost their lifes.

The tensor density is not """"artificially introduced"""". The numerical values of the four components of Ad are exactly the same as those which appear three times each among the components of Aa b c along with three each which are their negatives and forty zeros. So this is merely selecting a subset of components which represent the independent information in the original A.
If someone naively attempted to use Maxwell's equations in a curvilinear coordinate system or in the presence of significant amounts of gravity, then he would find that they still work in that context (except for the constitutive equations which relate D to E and H to B). How can this be explained in your ideology? It only makes sense when one realizes that some of the quantities are tensor densities.
So please see that I am not adding tensor densities to make life harder. Rather I am finding that they already exist and permitting their use to avoid the extra and unnecessary work of converting everything to ordinary tensors. Why multiply by the metric when you do not have to? Why use the Levi-Civita connection when partial derivatives will suffice?   """,0

However, emotions are high on the issue of global warming, and the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee has decided that it is more important for the climate change articles at Wikipedia to reflect their views on climate change, than it is for the climate change articles to be neutral and impartial in their presentation and content.

I have also added some internal links to other Wikipedia articles. The external links need re-formatting, to explain what they are, rather than just bare URLs, which I will try to do tomorrow. Coincidentally, we met, briefly, in 2005 in La Gomera at the start of the race.",0

 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan: Preamble 

It's already at wikisource:Constitution of the Kingdom of Afghanistan. Should I nominate it for deletion without redirect?   
 I just redirected to 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan; seems like the simplest solution.  Maybe some of them could be expanded one day if there was significant commentary on any portion of the constitution (a la Second Amendment). I know pretty much zero about Afghan law and doubt that they would realistically expanded, who knows though.   """,0

Actually no. Most who have declared themselves as Albanians, have also declared themselves as Muslims. You are right that there are Albanian speaking people of different faiths, yet they do not affiliate themselves with being Albanian. For example in a recent peer reviewed article by Pieroni who did fieldwork in the Upper Reka region said this of Orthodox Albanian speakers. 
 
Pieroni, Andrea, et al. """"One century later: the folk botanical knowledge of the last remaining Albanians of the upper Reka Valley, Mount Korab, Western Macedonia."""" Journal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine, 9. (1), 2013: 2-3. """"Locals are now exclusively Muslims, but Albanians of Christian Orthodox faith also lived in the villages until a few decades ago. For example, in Nistrovë, one side of the village (with a mosque) is inhabited by Muslims, while the other side was inhabited by Orthodox believers. The entire population of Orthodox Christians migrated to towns a few decades ago, but they return to their village homes sometimes during the summer. Most of the houses in this part of the village are however abandoned even though the Church has been recently restored. According to our (Albanian Muslim) informants, these migrated Orthodox Christian Albanians assimilated within the Macedonian culture and now prefer to be labelled as “Macedonians”, even if they are still able to fluently speak Albanian. Contact between these two subsets of the village communities, which were very intense and continuous in the past, no longer exists today.""""

These Reka Orthodox Albanian speakers where the main non-Muslim Albanian population in Macedonia who now identify as Macedonians.

"""==My complaint about the WMF==
When assessing WMF's policies, one need not resort to vicious name-calling or opprobrious epithets. One need only present the facts. Let's start with my claim that WMF insists that it can bring about peace and prosperity for the whole of humanity through violence, deception, oppression, exploitation, graft, and theft. Sorry, WMF, but, with apologies to Gershwin, """"it ain't necessarily so."""" Gloomy philodoxes like WMF are not born—they are excreted. However unsavory that metaphor may be, if WMF's patsies had even an ounce of integrity they would urge lawmakers to pass a nonbinding resolution affirming that a real fight against vagarious, gin-swilling Comstockism can be undertaken only if a basic change in social conditions makes it possible to set the stage so that my next letter will begin from a new and much higher level of influence.

Forgive me for boring you with all the gory details, but I must ask that WMF's torchbearers change the world for the better. I know they'll never do that so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to parlay personal and political conspiracy theories into a multimillion-dollar financial empire. All the deals WMF makes are strictly one-way. WMF gets all the rights, and the other party gets all the obligations. WMF's belief is that it should be free to identify political and religious groups that are its political enemies and re-label them as """"improvident, rambunctious know-nothings"""" in order to justify operations against them. Hey, WMF! Satan just called; he wants his worldview back.

I've tried to explain to WMF's snarky pals that WMF is incapable of looking with an open mind at anything that doesn't strictly endorse its views. As could be expected, they were a bit slow on the uptake. I just couldn't get them to comprehend that I can say one thing about WMF. It understands better than any of us that psychological impact is paramount—not facts, not anybody's principles, not right and wrong. I'm not suggesting that we behave likewise. I'm suggesting only that WMF is unquestionably proud of itself for conconcting such a """"brilliant"""" scheme for harming others or even instilling the fear of harm. In my opinion, however, that's the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas. Much better would be to give the needy a helping hand as opposed to an elbow in the face. That's the end of this letter. If I was unable to convince you that I am making an appeal to the intelligence of the reader not to be fooled by WMF's demagoguery, then you should definitely consider contacting me with your supporting or refuting evidence, opinions, personal stories, etc., so that I can make a better argument in my next letter.

"""" A bright line exists on edit warring, known as the three-revert rule (3RR). If an administrator has not acted already by this point, then action is very likely, especially if a report is made to the noticeboard.

I commend  for taking the actions he did.  The subsequent complaints Malke made, and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later, are a matter of record on his user talk page.  Malke has since deleted the notifications, but they are viewable in his talk page history, and make interesting reading.

After Malke's block on August 19, 2009, I decided I needed to take a step back.  For the past ten days I have busied myself with other Wikipedia subjects.  I now return to this page.  I suggest we talk a bit about what happened, and I also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month, edit by edit.  It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I'd welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   

On closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   

Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke's concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   

Malke's concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke's talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):

   
   
- *An impartial administrator just did; I don't know you from Adam, and haven't so much as looked at the contents of your edits; all that matters is that you broke WP:3RR, and received a short block for it; if you want to be unblocked, all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring, regardless of whether you think it is justified or not. :==( o )

 Betacommand is back 

Hello. I am contacting you because you are one of the editors/admins who is still active now, and was aware of the notoriously disruptive editor User:Betacommand, a.k.a User:Δ (Delta). As you probably know, he was eventually banned after a third arbitration case, due to the way he conducted himself in the pursuit of his main interest on Wikipedia, WP:NFCC enforcement.

What you may not know, is that he has evidently returned and has been editing as User:Werieth since 2012, in violation of that ban. After just a year, Werieth is already causing the same sort of disruption that Betacommand did - you may experience some deja vu by reading reports made about Werieth such as the one at the top of this AN archive. There are already several others. A quick perusal of Werieth's contributions will also reveal the same Betacommand-like self-assured approach, grounded in the belief that their edits are always """"100% correct and 100% according to policy"""" (when the reality was that he made basic errors and pushed policy boundaries at a rate that, while acceptable in ordinary users for a time limited period, was found to be unacceptable in an editor with the edit rate and communication issues Betacommand had, especially given their inability to change)

I and others have already tried to expose his return via these sock puppet investigations, although as you can see, it's not getting far. That's not for the lack of an answerable case though - you can see the latest summary in this post. Most of the obstruction can be put down to the usual dysfunctional and counter-productive aspects of Wikipedia governance, which of course will always aid experienced WP:GAMErs like Betacommand.

But you may or may not be surprised to learn that the people obstructing this investigation the hardest are three admins whose own conflict of interest with regard to Betacommand/NFCC is best demonstrated in their own words - Black Kite (repeatedly deflects attention away from Werieth and onto accusers), Kww (blocks accusers, and has already unblocked Werieth once) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (has basically declared all out war on anyone who even whispers that Werieth might be Betacommand).

The purpose of this post is to raise awareness about his return, and hopefully persuade one or more of you to resubmit that SPI with the evidence I'm sure you will be able to compile using your own knowledge of Betacommand's characteristic traits. At the very least to prompt you to put his talk page on your watch lists and regularly review his contributions (although obviously, don't waste your time trying to deal with any issues you see on the flawed basis that he is just any old user).

Also obviously, you should also raise a red flag every time you see one of those three admins trying to further suppress the inevitable exposure of his ban evasion. If his return is to be covered up for an unnecessarily long time, it should at least be done simply through general incompetence, rather than obvious COI based abuse of the tools/trusted position of admin. A few emails to the arbcom members who dealt with Betacommand also probably wouldn't go amiss - if ordinary admins aren't bothered about this particular user's return (and you will remember, blinded by their enthusiasm for having someone, anyone, perform NFCC enforcement edits, a great many of them were unwilling to even admit his particular approach to that necessary work was a problem), 

Betacommand's clandestine return to Wikipedia is bad enough as it is given that he has simply resumed where he left off in the NFCC enforcement field, with several users already having wasted a lot of time having to deal with him as if he were a legitimate user. But obviously the nightmare scenario if the cover-up is allowed to continue for another year, is if Werieth/Betacommand decides script assisted batch editing is not fast enough for his liking, and decides to take an altogether faster approach - possibly even trying to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff;=prev&oldid;=43661105",0

My dear  argues:

You can't use the term some critics when you're listing the same bloke twice ...(my emphasis: heh, it is a 'blockquote' too;-)

As long as the Universe of Discourse contains at least one member with the predicated quality logic tells me I am empowered to use the existential quantifier. In English, that's some.

Now that's to be distinguished from 'several' which is a usual indicator of more than, say, two or three. So to use the word 'several,' in an argument, is to imply, at least more than two.

So when an acquaintance of ours, name of , known to Block and recently given some Wiki admin. priviliges (AP) cites in his AP pleading:

He has been in dispute with several editors ... 

he's padding his case, since Blacketer full well knows that the only folks giving grief were:

Block
Blacketer

This came about because I started adding much more material to the Wiki entry on Natascha Engel and, in my innocence, I sidled-up to the Village Pump to seek advice on the substantiation of some of my contributions. I was particularly perplexed by the problem of my knowing certain facts through my personal correspondence with her.

Extensive source is available on the Talk page for the Engel article about what transpired next.

Well, anyway, Galloglass left the scene pretty quickly, so that left me contending with Block and Blacketer. Now correct me if I'm being stupid, but to me that leaves two. Then, mid-ocean Block jumps ship claiming a syndrome he named 'wikibonked' (I think - I've no idea what it means, but I think I'm getting to the stage where I may have caught a dose;-)

So that left one ... Blacketer. So 'one' is Blacketer's version of 'several.' And then you made him an administrator.

I've brought Blacketer to the stage since he's part of the same story of the 'double-standards' and 'hypocrisy' that I've discovered around here.

The term proto-Protestants has been in use now for quite a long time to describe religious movements sharing the beliefs very similar or even identical (as far as key issues are concerned) to those professed by Protestants of the 16the century. 

I was unable to find this definition online can you post a link.

Continued:
There clearly is a group of such movements, including the Waldensians, the Lollards, the Hussites, but also in the earlier centuries, the Vigilantians, the Aerians, the Helvidians, the Jovinians, whose views were identical to those of many Protestants.

I don't know that it is all that clear. Identical? Aerians insisted that the observance of Easter was a Jewish superstition and they fasted on Sundays. Not very Protestant. The Vigilantians argued against the veneration of relics, the sending of alms to Jerusalem, the rejection of earthly goods and the attribution of special virtue to the unmarried state, especially in the case of the clergy. No mention of the Bible, no mention of justification, nothing else Protestant. All that is known about Helvidius is that he did not believe in the Virgin Mary.  That doesn't exactly make him a Protestant. Identical is laughable - there is no evidence to back up such an assertion. Wikipedia is not about truth, it is for fact that can be cited with recognized secondary sources of evidence.

You went on:
This becomes even more obvious when we consider the fact, that the Waldensians, the Lollards and the Hussites joined the Reformation and often mixed with various Protestant groups. The Waldensian Church, still existing in Italy, is considered a Protestant group and not a sect, as User:Secisek tries to imply. This is because all key beliefs the Waldensians have professed since the 12th century are common to most Protestant groups and are different from those professed by sects considered heretical by both the Catholics and the Protestants.

Whoa, I did not imply they were a sect, I wrote that they were. I intended no offense with that word. The Waldensians were a sect, and they revised their doctrine at the Reformation to conform to the new Protestant thinking. This is taken from the Waldensian's article:

""""In 1532 they met with German and Swiss Protestants and ultimately adapted their beliefs to those of the Reformed Church. Moreover, the Waldensian absorption into Protestantism led to their transformation from a sect on the edge of Catholicism that shared many Catholic beliefs into a Protestant church adhering to the theology of John Calvin, which differed much from the beliefs of Peter Waldo. From that moment the Church became the Italian branch of Reformed churches.""""

This contradict your assertion:
The Waldensians have never altered their key beliefs, they are considered Protestants and still they had existed for over 3 centuries before the proper Protestants and the Reformation. Many scholars have used the term proto-Protestants in their articles, although there do exist historians who argue that the term should not be in use for various reasons.

The fact is, they have altered their key beliefs - that is what made them Protestant.

The problem is, however, that the Catholic historians often argue against the term to show that Protestants appeared only in the 16th century, while before them, there was just one Church of Christs and many small sects. For this reason even Waldensians, now considered a part of the Protestant Church even by the Church of Rome, are called a sect by Catholic historians. This dychotomy is absurd, as it implies that the Waldensians were at first a sect and then a Protestant group, while they have never changed their beliefs in the course of History. If the Waldensians are Protestants now, and they maintain the same views they professed in the late 12th century it means, that they have always been Protestants, even when the term had not been in use.

They have not maintained the same views, read the Waldensian article. They were still taking Roman Catholic Eucharist until the time of the Reformation, with the belief that the validity of the sacraments depends on the worthiness of the priest performing them. Seven sacrament is not very Protsestant.  

I am not a Roman Catholic, nor do I care what Roman Catholic historians argue, although I am sure RC historians would at least acknowledge the existance of the Orthodox and Oriental Churches rather then maintain that there was """"just one Church"""". The facts are quite clear - Protestants appeared in the 16th century for a variety of historical and cultural reasons that existed at that moment in history. They could not have appeared before that moment and it mental gerrymandering or wishful thinking to believe otherwise. I will be happy to discuss this further, but it seem that the",0

 Murder of a deposed Sheikulislam in 1821/ was this Haci Halil Efendi? 

There is information in some sources about a deposed Sheikhulislam who was travelling in 1821 to Mecca with his family for pilgrimage, it was the time of the Greek war of Independence and their ship was captured by Orthodox Christians of Hydra and everyone on board was killed. The source state that this Sheikhulislam was actually pro-Greek but still got murdered. Unfortunately the name of the Sheikhulislam is not mentioned, is it possible that this person would be Haci Halil?

Has anybody more information about Haci Halil Efendi? The source claims without sources that he was murdered in Constantinople by torture. It states that he was deposed because he tried to prevent a massacre of Greeks, but we also need Turkish/Ottoman sources.
The article needs more sources and investigation.  

The following is written in Massacres during the Greek Revolution.

""""Another similar massacre took place in the island Hydra, one of the most important Aegean islands. Besides the atrocities committed against the local Muslims in the island, two hybrid brigs captured a Turkish ship laden with a valuable cargo, and carrying a number of passengers. Among these was a recently deposed Sheik-ul-Islam, or patriarch of the Orthodox Muslims, who was said to be going to Mecca for pilgrimage. It was his efforts to prevent the cruel reprisals which, at Constantinople, followed the news of the massacres in Peloponnese, which brought him into disfavor, and caused his exile.W. Alison Phillips, The War of Greek Independence, p.66 There were also several other Turkish families on board. British historian of the Greek revolt, W.

RM, in that interview he identifies himself with pantheism and names Baruch Spinoza as another Jewish pantheist. A quick look on Google Books shows that he is often claimed as an atheist, as Northern heard say 1 2 3 4 5. In one 1974 work, Ben-Gurion is called a 'freethinking deist [who] had profound reverence for the Bible' 6. I've not been able to confirm his pantheism anywhere else, but a quote from the man himself should be considered more reliable, even though this may only have been his opinion at the time of the interview (1970). According to source 5, he identified as an atheist during the 1960 census, so perhaps his views changed or were fluctuant. It seems that it's hard to label him as anything, although whatever he was, it looks like he wasn't a theist and rejected traditional religious views of Judaism.   23:20, 23 July 2015",0

 Statement 

I was angry at what I consider to be a massive campaign against Ed Poor's RFA. I rarely, if ever, agree with Ed on anything, but I felt the opposes were over the top. My comment about riff-raff is not uncivil. Riff-raff is a child's word, if I wanted to be insulting or uncivil I would have used much harsher words than that, I assure you. Further, I felt that many of the attacks on Ed by the opposers were far worse than that, even the before-refactored comment. I was responding to my believe that Ed Poor needs to be allowed to bring his dissent to the Intelligent Design and Global Warming articles, despite the fact I totally disagree with his viewpoint. Keeping controversial articles free of being walled gardens of woo is a goal that Wikipedia should seek. We cannot allow even the most righteous people WP:OWN whole swaths of subject matter. Not to be pointed, but the greater scientific community was patently wrong on eugenics, the popular bastardization of Darwin's natural selection, at the turn of the 20th century. I've been reading an excellent book, War Against the Weak by Edwin Black, which catalogs just how it was a group of determined American and British scientists popularized this hideous science and even directly inspired the tactics of Hitler. It is a chilling account of what happens when determined scientists insist their viewpoint is the only viewpoint that matters and how uncritical groupthink led to horrendous travesties being perpatrated against our poor and sick at that period of time. My point is that groupthink is bad. Refusing to debate opposing views is bad. Ed brings the necessary questioning which ultimately results in better articles because lazy and poorly sourced material is kept out, while some space is given for the opposing viewpoint. I feel that my fellow colleagues treatment of Ed, based mostly on his behavior on another project - which by the way is admittedly slanted (the """"conserv"""" in CP should have been the hint) - was aweful. My comments were not directed at anyone in particular and were only meant as an attempt to console Ed on his good faith attempt to serve the community again. Please do not wheel war over this block. I will just go do some move to commons until it is resolved satisfactorily. Cheers!   """,0

 OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page 
Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename

What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  

As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).

Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.

This is my last reply if you continue to present yourself in this manner.  Please write more civilly.

I expect people to go to Oyster Bay just as I expect them to go to Barre, Vermont.  When you type that, do you expect a disambiguation page or do you except the city?  Admittedly, it's not the most convenient, but that's the way it is in all eight """"town"""" states.  Are you going to try to change every single community with this sort of disambiguation?  If so, go ahead — but unless you so desire, don't try to have one or two changed.  You speak of errors that result (for example, the Oyster Bay disambiguation page) — I do my best to fix wrong links as a result of changes such as this, but I don't see why I must be held responsible for every single wrong link.  If you never make mistakes, that's good; but I suspect that you so do.  So what?  It doesn't matter if you make a good-faith error, especially if you try to fix it once you realise that something's wrong.

By the way, if you put """"Oyster Bay, New York"""" into the Census Bureau's Factfinder, you'll get this page: it's the town.  Barre, Vermont is similar to what we'd call a disambiguation page; the city is listed as Barre city, Vermont.  This, I expect, is the reason that these articles are named this way: the Census is our source for the names and the basic information, and therefore we entitle our articles likewise by this reliable source.

"Hi Thatcher, I think this could be directly submitted to the committee since the identity confirmation isn’t an issue anymore from what Grandmaster said (that Ehud is an Azerbaijani user) and from Atabek’s words about the fact that anyone could choose any username of their liking.

Because at this point, if it is true that Ehud is not claiming to be an Ehud Lesar anymore, if it is Adil he can ask anyone to provide identity to have him return, because he doesn’t need to prove he is Ehud Lesar. So this case should be taken to judge if there is sufficient evidence that Ehud is Adil or not.

 Claims of Non-Neutrality from the Non-Neutral, a.k.a., Double-Standards for Darwin 

Hello,

I'm writing to report a case of non-neutrality from the user . After editing the page on Irreducible complexity to make it more neutral, my changes were reverted, and I received the following message from the aforementioned user:

Welcome to Wikipedia, and thank you for your contributions. One of the core policies of Wikipedia is that articles should always be written from a neutral point of view. A contribution you made to Irreducible complexity appears to carry a non-neutral point of view, and your edit may have been changed or reverted to correct the problem. Please remember to observe this. Thank you. ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community. To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science SÆdon 

I'm fairly new here to Wikipedia, but I understand the basic rules regarding article editing, particularly involving mandatory neutrality. I'm confident that none of my additions were non-neutral in any way which biased the article. They were criticisms of criticisms of irreducible complexity  precisely the sort of thing expected for a neutral, fair-and-balanced article on irreducible complexity. Surely neutrality requires that both arguments for and against controversial ideas be presented, no? What the actions of SÆdon and the other watchdogs of any article involving the Darwinian evolution vs. intelligent design controversy say is that only one side of the issue, theirs, deserves to be presented. This is textbook neutrality  exactly what Wikipedia strives to avoid.

Notice the non-neutrality in Saedon's message:

ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community.

This is an example of either dishonesty of ignorance on Saedon's part. Intelligent design is one of the hottest topics in science today precisely because it is taken seriously by the so-called """"scientific community."""" They take it seriously because it's a very powerful, evidence-based argument that poses a great threat to the current orthodoxy, Darwinian evolution. This is why Saedon and the like watch over any and all articles regarding this debate, making sure they remain heavily biased towards Darwinian evolution, while reverting both arguments for I.D. and criticisms of criticisms against I.D., as happened in my case.

To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science

To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community views I.D. as pseudoscience is a factual statement. While they may be in the minority, there are many members of the scientific community who agree wholeheartedly that I.D. is science. To close your eyes, shove your fingers in your ears, and pretend that these scientists do not exist  as Saedon has done  is intellectual dishonesty. To then permeate Wikipedia with that intellectual dishonesty is unacceptable. Notice, too, Saedon's non-neutral opinion that intelligent design is theology, rather than science.

I refute that claim.

I'm atheist regarding the Gods of any organized religion, and yet I fully accept the scientific-basis of intelligent design. It's no more theological than is big bang cosmology, or even its counterpart, Darwinian evolution. While all three views may have (a)theistic implications, the argumentation and observation behind all three are strictly secular and scientific. For Saedon to baldly assert that intelligent design is theology, and use this bald assertion to further justify his non-neutrality, watchdog-like behavior is unacceptable.

I expect this situation to be dealt with accordingly; fairly, without bias, and absent bald assertions and loaded claims that encourage, if not outright justify, that bias.

Thank you.

Hello James Cantor,

Thank you so much for your comments. The last 21 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine have had wiki pages for a number of years and the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate. I just find is unusual that Crusio's page is so much larger than those who are far more notable. I think Crusio's page size should be about the size of an average Nobel Laureate. I can not but wonder how Wim Crusio's page is so much bigger than that last 21 of the most recent Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine. As a scientist, one tends to plot data on a graph, and if you where to do so, Crusio's data point would be considered an out lier. As I stated, the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate over many years. These pages have been edited by hundreds of users for many years, I think that gives us good yard stick, and says something about how much information a scientists site should have. While I agree with you that more """"good material"""" is better, it appears that hundreds of wiki users disagree with this statement, based upon the data.""",0

No, you have not explained how """"X is Y"""" is somehow not clearer, simpler and more objective than """"X is best known for Y"""".

 Example 

""""For example, a train that weighs 1 kg moving at 500 m/s and that hits a 'perfect' steel wall where it uniformly decelerates from 500 m/s to 0 m/s in .02 seconds, has an approximate impact force of 25000 N. Thus, a body which decelerates more quickly has a greater effective impact than one which decelerates more slowly.""""

I'm not doubting the calculation here, but the example is a bit unusual.  500 meters per second is equivalent to about 1118 miles per hour, faster than a bullet train.  And a 1 kg train is like a toy train or something... so in my head I'm imagining a toy train breaking the sound barrier and smashing into a steel wall.  I'm not sure what a typical train weighs (maybe 50,000 kg), but apparently their max speed is about 50 mph or 80 km/h or 22.222 m/s.

50,000 kg * 22 m/s / 0.02s = 55,000,000 N

"Response to your Lieberman/Lamont post 

 Your questions are all over the place so I'll just give you my over-arching opinion about the whole thing... My opinion is that Lieberman will win the general election as an independent.  I don't agree with him 90% of the time but I like him because he's a honest politician. (one of the few in America) As for Lamont, I see him as Howard Dean II.  Sure, the left-wing loves him but when it gets closer to the election, centrist democrats and independents will vote for someone else.  I have no idea what CNN will do though I have a strong feeling that they would LIKE to support Lamont.  Personally, I can't stand anti-war candidates in this era because most of them don't want to use the military AT ALL.  That being said, I'm not blindly pro-war, either.  I want to use force when it's neccessary.  I supported the reasons for the war in Iraq (and still do) but I'm totally pissed off about how Bush has waged the war.

Al Qaeda would be a destructive force in Islam that most Muslims would reject without a problem, but still such discussion would belong in Islam.

There were no official country codes before 1976: Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of each Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.

At the Games of 1956, 1960, and 1964 the German team was simply known as """"Germany"""" and the usual country code of (GER) was used. Yet, the IOC code EUA is currently applied in hindsight in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given. 

Yugoslavia does not exist anymore as a country - the FRG does. The (FRG) Federal Republic of Germany did not cease to exist. It was a simple code change, same country, same NOC. NO alternate NOCs: EUA, FRG and GER have always had the same German National Olympic Committee (NOC) recognized in 1895, same NOC President (Willi Daume, 1960–1993), same Olympic Committee located in Frankfurt - only the codes have changed. Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). """"West Germany"""" did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG. The """"enlarged"""" Federal Republic of Germany (known simply as """"Germany"""") is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany - the very same country, with the same National Olympic Committee since 1895.

Bridge River Cones location/range

I just checked the lat-long you gave for the Bridge River Cones; it's in the Gunn Valley to the west of Lower Taseko Lake, near Yohetta Valley - north of the Tchaikazan.  That location, if it's correct, is in the Chilcotin Ranges (which may or may not be a subset of the Pacific Ranges depending on who you're talking to).   Can you located them more precisely; the boundary between the Pacific Ranges and Chilcotin Ranges isn't exact in Holland, and I'll have to refer to them somewhere; the crest of the Coast Mountains in that area is definitely Pacific Ranges; where the """"fall-off"""" is I'll have to read Holland again to find out; if the Cones were in the upper Bridge River itself they might be considered Pacific Ranges; although the north bank of that river is part of the Chilcotin Ranges (because the Dickson Range is); I'd say the boundary - maybe - is the pass between the Lord and Bridge Rivers on the ENE side of the Lillooet Icecap - 50°56'11""""-123°31'57"""" , although NW from there sort of NW across the Lord, Falls and Tchaikazan Rivers; Mount Monmouth is definitely in the Pacific Ranges, to the west of that line...; anything north of the Yohetta Valley, or the lower Tchaikazan, as your current Bridge River Cones location is, is in the Chilcotin Ranges for sure.

Well, my point is that Navarre (for example) has indoubtly links to the Basque Country (some parts do speak basque, some historical links...) and even have another association much related to the IRL called EUSKARA KULTUR ELKARGOA. But that doesn't mean we should link both regions in the same basket. The navarrese government has never expressed any intention of reducing its own political or social identity, the same way Andorra, Balears or Valencia haven't either. Participating in a single cultural project such as the IRL, doesn't mean that suddenly those territories have renounced to their own identities (so close or so distanct to the Catalan proper). We are not even explaining that it is just a part of the population which may be considered as catalans... We are not talking about the spanish-speakers (around 50% of all the inhabitants of these regions), the french-speakers or simply all the foreigners living for years in these territories:

Balearic Islands: 21% of the total pop. (that's 224K)
Catalonia: 15% of the total pop. (that's 1,1 million)
Valencia: 17,7% of the total pop. (that's 866K)

They sum up as 2,2 million people who don't consider themselves neither Catalan nor Valencian nor Balearic. Then, add the national population which don't speak a word of the language (2,6 million link) or even the ones who can speak it but don't use it as primary language (it roses up to around 50% of the total pop.)...

So, because of that, I keep thinking that putting ALL the inhabitants of these territories (or just the name of the regions) in the same basket is so so so """"dangerous""""... We are talking about figures ranging between 30% and 50% of people who may have a much doubtly catalanity... And that's a LOT of people. MauritiusXXVII (Aut Disce, Aut Doce, Aut Discede!). """,0

(b) or (c) seem to be reasonable, popular choices. This is something that people are just going to have to think hard about and come to a consensus.  What is OR depends on what we decide the article is about, since it is clear that we are using """"ghetto benches"""" a bit figuratively.  Changing the title is a possibility. Under (c), but probably not (b), the replacement from the notes that I suggested, the quote from Meltzer -""""In fact, ever since the attainment of independence, the universities in Poland had been strongholds of Endejca supporters and centers for anti-semitic agitation.” would be acceptable.

Rather than have Folken once again try to """"game the system"""" and then accuse me of being domineering when I try to revert his mistakes, who else here honestly prefers what he did over what was here before?  
1-it is not """"Original Research"""" it is clarifying what was a confusing point
2-I don't care if I've """"hurt your feelings"""", but...yes, the explanation you substituted wasn't proper English and just said """"one quarter German and Japanese"""" etc.....if I don't like it I should write it better? Yikes.  Folken I'm not going to help you in defacing an article
3-once again, you're doing surprisingly little """"actual work"""" but simply quoting rules and """"gaming the system"""" without contributing much of any real value
4-Folken, I'm not going to hand you a crown for quoting rules out of context for your own benefit, nor am I taking such threats seriously.  You would use the letter of the law to destroy the spirit of the law.  
5-Folken, how many times can I say this?  I'll be more direct:  you are not an Administrator, and have no real authority or """"sticking power"""" to maintain a revert.  I'm going to revert your awful changes, and let me guess; you're going to revert them back and claim """"revert war""""?  Yikes.    

I am not """"gaming the system"""". Please explain what you mean by that instead of throwing random bad faith accusation. You cannot revert """"mistakes"""" as I haven't done any, contrary to you. Or again, please prove what mistakes I would have committed, instead of blindly reverting and justifying your actions with unsubstanciated and gratuitous accusations.

1) No, making things up about the never-mentionned nationality or appearance of never-seen characters, or about the supposed lives of characters prior to the series (the dual-citizenship) that are never mentionned, is original research. There is no need of """"clarifying"""" with OR a point that is self-explanatory.

2) Again, your words are not the word of God. You can use all the excuses you want, like """"improper english"""", it still won't work as you are unable to prove anything you're saying. And yes, you are going to rewrite instead of remove. Otherwise, it means your """"proper english"""" is just an unsubstanciated pretext. If you refuse to reword, then it means there's nothing to reword and that it's already proper english.
Your bad faith accusation of """"defacing"""" are considered as a personal attack. You have now been warned.

3) """"Actual work"""" includes getting rid of unsuitable edits like yours. And yes, quoting rule is an important thing in WP as rules define how contributors must work on WP. So yes, correcting the edits of users like you who don't give a damn about the rules and make unsuitable edits is a huge """"actual"""" work. Also, you still fail to explain what """"gaming the system"""" means...Don't throw random accusations.

4) """"Quoting rules out of context"""" seems to be your favorite attack. But please explain how what I said would be """"out of context"""". You're quick in accusing and insulting, not in actually proving your point...And yes, I'm serious.

5) I'll be clear, VVVVV, you are not an Administrator, and have no real authority or """"sticking power"""" to maintain a revert. The thing is, you're not going to revert anything, unless you've forgotten your little speech about """"consensus"""" and """"community effort""""...I have not see you discussing anything about content or asking anyone's opinion. Sure, you've stated all the hatred you have for me, but it doesn't count as consensus discussion.

So, to sum it up, you accuse me of """"being an admin"""" because I oppose to your edits, but you don't have any problem with mass reverting without any justification ? enough of this.  

Cooler heads prevailing:  yes, I have indeed not changed your reversion, and I will wait for what everyone else has to say.  (I didn't mean that last part about """"what if I change it back?"""" literally..nevermind).  but on to point 2:  specifically, your profile says that English is not your primary language, and you added in a sentence that didn't make sense; leading me to suspect that you are honestly mistaken.  Not in grammar or something, I mean it was confusing.  Why should I help you make a reversion I disagree with in the first place?  And if it's because you're quoting a literal translation of a Red Cross Book excerpt....Folken you honestly know that the literal translation is choppy and needs to be smoothed out.

I don't know how large your local paper is; my experience with larger papers is that they verify the author to at least a basic degree (believe me, the items I was writing about are not nearly as contentious as the matter at hand here, nor am I in a position akin to the rector's.) And in a situation like this, there would certainly be a correction if the rector claimed the letter wasn't his, and no such correction appears. As such, that the rector made the statement seems to me quite adequately sourced, even if the claims he makes are not. However, if you would like to slightly reword it to make it even clearer that the rector is making claims that are not otherwise in evidence (replacing stated with claimed or asserted), I would not have an objection.
I think the claim, even if treated as true, is not much of a claim; the count of accused priests has an invisible """"yet"""" hanging over it, as more recent graduates would have had less time to have accusers come forward than those from previous classes. And I think the reference is good to have in there for something it -doesn't- include; the letter is essentially a """"yes, but"""" note rather than a """"no"""" note, as it doesn't deny anything in the Times article and thus to some degree blunts any objection that it's just the Times reporters say-so.

Go out in a blaze of glory...on my own talk page???  No, that's not my intention at all.  It's a very small venue to go out on, I can assure you.  My intention is simply to tell the truth.  Even if it hurts.  On that, I don't compromise.  If that appears suidical to you, it's a sad indictment on the frequency of truth telling in you neck of the woods.  Others compromise on truth, often because they care about $$$ more than truth.  That's what I believe motivates the deletions on WP and elsewhere regarding monetary reform.  That's why this stuff isn't EVER published in """"mainstream"""" sources.  This stuff is starved of funds until it dies.  People who care about $$$ more than truth hate people pointing this out to them.  Because it hurts.  It shows they aren't very smart, but they are very selfish.  It's as simple as that.

One other thing.  Wealth distribution is a separate and distinct issue from the issue of money creation and distribution.  They are related and they do interact, but they are distinct issues.  Many Libertarians (such as Ron Paul) couldn't care less about wealth distribution provided the way in which money creation is just and in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.  Free markets can determine wealth distribution - provided the way in which money is created is open and democractically approved and """"just"""" and the product of rational discussion (i.e. not based on the threat of a bullet to the head if you question the current method of money creation and distribution).  Once new money is created, it gets gets circulated according to the tax laws, and competition laws, and finance laws and a multitude of other factors, and ends up in someone's account somewhere.  Money creation is (arguably) much more important and has many more dynamic implications for an economy than wealth distribution, which is a separate issue.  Again, this confusion shows that the level of understanding of these issues is woeful and I despair at ever increasing the general public's understanding of these vitally important issues, especially given the limitless $$$s financing the countervailing forces (Gregalton, Zenwhat, etc) that are lined up against anyone questioning the sustainability and pointing out the absolute stupidity of the current debt-based system.

Reactions from San Diegans
After the format move to 570, many who live in the San Diego area had complained that they were unable to get the station's new signal, fueling the complaint that AM 570 had """"Los Angeles-ized"""", and no longer catered to San Diego's sports teams and listeners.

This also came to the attention of Premiere Radio Networks, Jim Rome's syndicator; XEPRS-AM, """"the Mighty 1090,"""" a rival radio station that broadcasts in San Diego and parts of Orange County and Los Angeles (and run by the Broadcast Company of the Americas, whose CEO John Lynch administered XTRA Sports Radio in San Diego from the mid 1980s to its merger with 1150 in 2002), picked up The Jim Rome Show in September 2005. 

As the radio flagship home of the Los Angeles Lakers, KLAC normally put much more emphasis and focus on the team, possibly very much to the chagrin of listeners who are not supporters of the Lakers. This was especially evident in the midday program The Loose Cannons, then headlined by Hartman, Jacobs and Laker radio broadcaster and former player Mychal Thompson.

GA review process

Well, the review process was instructive, as were the comments regarding how to improve the article. I had no idea that it was wrong to approach individual editors to comment (as I explained above it was to """"get the ball rolling"""" – naivety on my part, I'm afraid). I also think that Pyrotec's choice of language here (""""This review looks very much like a """"favour"""" being granted to the article's nominator by a co-conspirator"""") is very regrettable – perhaps he would like to retract it, look again at the six editors I asked to review the article (I chose a cross-section of editors experienced in CC pages but who had not made a contribution here – also explained above), and admit that he jumped to conclusions. Another example of why good faith is so important. Anyway in future, I'll just make a general post on the talk page about GA nominations. 
From the comments re: the article itself it's clear that the article needs work in certain areas. Specifically:
MOS issues, esp. with regard to the synopsis
Restructuring of criticism section and dealing with """"stubby paragraphs""""
Consistency in spelling 
Overlong sentences in synopsis (although Guetterda's criticism """"the synopsis is written in a narrative form - x happened, then the author introduced y, then z happened - which is inappropriate for the synopsis of a book of this form"""" may be misplaced as the book is a chronological account of this subject) 
Delingpole's review quoted in the lead but not the main body
 Further critical review needed/possible problems with tone
 Needs more images

That should be enough to be getting along with)) I don't regard the rejection as a setback, but merely a blip on the road to getting The Real Global Warming Disaster to GA status one day, in strict compliance with WP guidelines, though I still have reservations about how wise it was to choose a book from this subject area. Anyway it is a terrific learning experience. Thanks to all who shared their opinions.   """,0

 General Authority Assignments 
Thanks for updating Elder Zivic's assignment. However, I looked on LDS.org and failed to find any mention there of his assignment. I see two other seventies (though I can't remember who) that are listed as Assistant Executive Directors of the Temple Department, but under Zivic's LDS.org biography, that assignment is not listed. Is it possible that this was a previous assignment that he has now been released from? As soon as LDS.org has an updated list of assignments, I guess we'll know for sure. Please respond on my talk page, as I don't habitually check other users' talk page for a response. Thanks.   
Hi!  I do recall that LDS.org's bio on Elder Zivic does not list the Temple Department assignment.  Actually, as I recall, it does not list anything subsequent to his previous service in an area presidency.  I obtained the information from other directories I reviewed.  There are actually 4 assistants at the present time to William Walker, in his role as Executive Director.  Hope that helps some.  Thanks for the question to ensure we're on track.   
On the list we have, I see Elder Choi, Elder Zivic, and Elder Gibbons listed as Assistant Executive Directors of the Temple Department. So now my question is, who is the 4th person you spoke of? Also, on the list that you are taking this information from, does it contain any other assignments of general authorities that we can put on that page? Again, please respond on my talk page. Thanks.   
It is Elder Baxter and I have updated that portion of the table/info box.  Thanks!   
It seems you forgot to respond to the second question of my last post, so I'll ask it again: On the list that you got the information from about the Temple Department Assistant Executive Directors, does it list any other assignments for seventies that we don't have on the WP list? Any additional information you can contribute would be appreciated. Again, please respond on my talk page. Thanks.   
I didn't forget, but I don't believe there is anything else that we would add, so I probably just skipped over the inquiry. ) There are some items that need to be officially announced before they are included as well.  Thanks!    
There are other changes, but we'll have to wait until they're officially announced? I really wish you hadn't said that. My curiosity is piqued. I won't ask what these changes are, much as I want to. You're probably not at liberty to say. One question I can ask: Where are you getting all this information? Do you by any chance have access to the CDOL? What Church position do you hold that allows you to be privy to this information? These are questions I feel I can ask. In the meantime, for the sake of my sanity, any additional information you feel you can give me, even if we have to wait until it's officially announced to list it here, would be appreciated. If you can tell me anything, I promise that I won't make it public. However, if you can't give me any more details until it's official, I understand completely. I am copying my comments here to my talk page, where I hope you will respond to this post as you have the past ones.   
 Ha ha - OK, sorry to have piqued the interest!  Nothing major, but always need to ensure the proper order is followed when updating info.  Yep, there are a few good opportunities to see updates in what goes on across the church.  Yes, I know, not a great answer! )

Proposed Controversy Section

1, I requested administrator assistance because of user mongo's unrelenting deletion of anything I post, including a NPOV Template at the top of the article...he removed it within minutes...the template states it should not be removed until the issues are discussed and resolved.
2, I'm simply proposing a Controversy Section, or any separate section, with the following.
Outside Magazine revealed Kellogg used the """"powerful steroid dexamethasone"""" for an Everest speedclimb attempt.http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/Climbings-Little-Helper.html
The above 'powerful steroid dexamethasone' is in the subtitle of the article, and the paragraph on Kellogg is about 30 paragraphs from the top.
3, I'm open to different wording.
4, Mongo objected to this with various personal objections about the climber.  Mongo did not propose other wording, or any other alternative.  Instead he deleted it within minutes, and did not suggest discussing it, nor would tolerate any discussion.  Isn't this a violation of wikipedia conduct?
5, Fact:  National media Outside Magazine did an article on the matter, it's a critical article, and the journalist did a paragraph on Kellogg's use of the prescription drug on Everest.
I will try to find other mention of Kellogg's use of the drug...there is mention of it at his sponsor's blog Outdoor Research.
6, Administrator, could you inquire into whether other moderators etc are joining together to control the information in the article?
7, Could you ask for a third party to take part?

 Accuracy of 'quarrel' quote 

According to Ralph Keyes, the quote in the article """"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong... No Viet Cong ever called me nigger"""" is a misquotation.  Keyes says: When Muhammad Ali refused induction into the Army, he was widely quoted as saying, “No Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” This was a perfect marriage of anti-war and anti-racist sentiment. Better yet, it came straight from the mouth of a mega-celebrity thought to possess primitive folk wisdom. The only problem is that Ali never made this comment. “It’s wasn’t really his mind-set to say something in that way,” explained Ali biographer Thomas Hauser. “The companion thought of that comment is ‘people call me nigger in this country every day.’ I never heard Ali say ‘white people in this country call me nigger.’ He would attack racism. But he wouldn’t personalize it.” Despite extensive searching by himself and others, Hauser has never found the source of “no Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” He concluded that it was just one of those things that got picked up and passed around in the 60s. It was a comment we wanted Ali to make so badly that we made it for him.""",0

I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started.

I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me.

""""Scientists occasionally invent hypothetical entities with special abilities as part of a thought experiment. These """"demons"""" have abilities that are nearly limitless, but they are still subject to the physical laws being theorized about.

For example, in Descartes' Second Meditation, it is argued, as a thought experiment, that it is at least possible that there is an all-powerful evil demon who is deceiving me, such that this demon causes me to have false beliefs, including the belief that there is an object before me and the belief that two plus three equals five. Note that the power of such a demon would be two-fold: both empirical and rational thinking can be completely compromised. This leads to a worrisome argument:

   1. One knows some fact or other only when one can rule out that there is such a demon.
   2. But one can never be in a position rule out that there is such a being, since we can never be sure that the demon isn't merely toying with our epistemic situation.

This is Qatarihistorian
First of all, user Mttll was conducting vandalism on a hidden agenda. He didn't like the fact the Sultanate of Rum is identified as a Persianate state, even though sources clearly indicated the Persianate nature/identity of the state due to two factors: 1) that the state was based on a Persianate court culture. 2) that the state's official language was Persian. 

Nevertheless, user Mttll decided to move the term """"Persianate"""" to the section of arts and architecture, in order to disguise historical facts. When I prompted him of this, he tried to FURTHER disguise his actions by renaming the arts and architecture section to > culture, but that still was invalid.

The irony is, even though he wanted to discuss this issue with me on the article's talk page, he didn't want to compromise, therefore he said something along the lines of """"I don't care what you think"""" and went ahead with his pathetic actions of distorting facts. 

I even showed in my edits that I had no problem with him wanting to call the Sultanate of Rum a """"Turkish"""" state, so long as he provided references for it. By the way, LONELYPLANET travel guides are not reliable references, I hope you people realize that.

Therefore in my recent edits, I wrote the Sultanate of Rum was a Persianate AND Seljuk Turkish state. It can be both at the time. They don't conflict each other by any means. Now the problem with user Mttll is his clear nationalistic agenda in the article, whereby he tries to promote only the Turkish aspect of the state while negating the sources to suggest the Persianate aspect.

In his user talk page, he is blatantly lying to the admin by telling him that I reached agreements with him. I certainly did not. And for the sake of wikipedia's reliability, I will ensure the information regarding Sultanate of Rum being a Persianate state will be restored because nothing warranted its move in that article, unless a hidden nationalistic agenda was intended.

A Blog Or Not a Blog, that is the question

Editor Canderra argues that the sources below are blogs and has deleted the material. The material is still not present in the article but no other editor has bothered to confirm or deny these assertions (For whatever reason).  Please take your time now to review the section and check the sources for yourself, lets see if they really are blogs.

New York Sun writer, Williams Myers, labels Che as a """"sociopathic thug"""". Other US newspaper critics have made similar remarks. They point out that Che Guevara was responsible for the torture and execution of hundreds of people in Cuban prisons, and the murder of many more peasants in the regions controlled or visited by his guerrilla forces. Contrary to Che supporters, these critics also argue that Che was a blundering tactician with no recorded combat victories. They claim that Che failed medical school in Argentina and that there is no evidence that he earned a medical degree.  They note that Che murdered individuals on dubious grounds and took their property, seized private manors for himself, and distributed property among communist bureaucrats rather than the peasants. The also state that he not only oversaw the prison, over which he ordered the execution of hundreds if not thousands of Cubans, but also helped institute forced labor camps when volunteerism failed. Finally, these critics believe that Che was a major failure at managing the Cuban economy as he """"oversaw the near-collapse of sugar production, the failure of industrialization, and the introduction of rationing—all this in what had been one of Latin America’s four most economically successful countries since before the Batista dictatorship."""",,

Some critics, such as Che-Mart, have merchandised their dislike of Che Guevara by marketing t-shirts poking fun at both Che Guevara and his supporters, for example, pointing out what they percieve as an irony: Che Guevara as one of capitalisms hotest selling images.

"RAF and Commonwealth pilots all wore seat-type parachutes which fitted into the standard pilot's bucket seat, whilst the other crew members all wore chest-fitted removable parachutes. The parachute pack clipped-on to the harness at the front (chest) and only needed to be attached immediately before jumping. For confined rear turrets the pack was sometimes stored outside the turret in the fuselage, the gunner only needing to reach behind him to open the two rear doors of the turret and reach into the fuselage. Where the tail gunner stowed his parachute depended on personal preference and to some extent, on his physical size.

The internal dimensions of the Lancaster and its turrets was somewhat wanting in terms of space, as when the basic aircraft had been designed (as the Manchester) the normal flying clothing was limited to perhaps a Sidcot suit and a parachute. With the increasing later use of such apparel as Irvin jackets and Mae Wests and other impedimenta the average crew member became a much bulkier figure, leading to difficulties in exiting the aircraft in an emergency, the dimensions of the escape hatches remaining unchanged. This possibly accounts for the higher crew losses for the Lancaster compared to the Halifax, which was also much roomier inside.",0

 Avoid blindly changing capitalization 

An editor recently used the AWB tool to change a bunch of capitalizations in a way that hurts the article.  I undid his edit.  There are probably a few things that need to be lowercased but they will require case-by-case analysis.

While there is some capitalization that could be changed without controversy, there is some which clearly should be kept capitalized and some which may be debatable.

Note:  In the """"rules"""" listed below, I'm assuming the rules of capitalization haven't changed significantly since the 1930s, and that we can rely on the capitalization used in Amendment XX as a guide.  If this is false then let me know and I'll strike everything that follows.

Cases where capitalization should be copied verbatim:
The text of Amendment XX should be copied verbatim from accurate transcripts.

Other cases that clearly need capitalization:
Any form of Congress, President, Senator, etc. which is being used in the article in substantially the same way as it is being used Amendment XX, where it is capitalized in the Amendment (other than at the start of a sentence or any other place where any word would be capitalized).

Other cases that clearly do not need capitalization:
Any form of those words that do not specifically apply to offices or officeholders of the federal government of the United States of America.
Any form of those words which is being used in the article in substantially the same way as it is being used Amendment XX, where it is NOT capitalized in the Amendment or where it clearly would not be capitalized but for the fact that it appears at the start of a sentence or or any other place where any word would be capitalized.

Other cases that may require discussion (or which may fall into one of the above categories - I'm going to plead grammatical ignorance here):
Forms of those words which are ambiguous as to whether they are specific the United States federal government or not and which it is unimportant to make the distinction.
Any form of those words which is being used in the article in substantially the same way as it is being used Amendment XX, where it is capitalized because it is at the start of a sentence or any other place where any word would be capitalized, and it's unclear if the word would be capitalized but for that fact.
Forms of those words where they clearly apply to the federal office but the use doesn't map directly to the use in Amendment XX (this is the case where I'm unclear on the rules of grammar).""",0

Islamophobia article vs. Antisemitism article
The first section in the Islamophobia article dedicated to in-depth development of the concept...

The concept of Islamophobia has been criticized on several grounds.[24][25][26] Some critics argue that it is real, but is just another form of racism and does not require its own category,[27] while others argue that it is used to censor criticism, that its use threatens free speech,[25][28] or is used to silence issues relating to Muslim populations in Western countries.[29]

Novelist Salman Rushdie and others signed a manifesto entitled Together facing the new totalitarianism in March 2006 which denounced Islamophobia as """"a wretched concept.""""[23] British academic Michael Burleigh argues that the term 'spares anyone the need to examine what has gone wrong within [Europe's Muslim] communities'.[29] Others, such as Edward Said, consider Islamophobia as it is evinced in Orientalism to be a 'secret sharer' in a more general antisemitic Western tradition.[30][31][32] However, Daniel Pipes says that """"'Islamophobia' deceptively conflates two distinct phenomena: fear of Islam and fear of radical Islam.""""[33]

The concept of Islamophobia as formulated by Runnymede is criticized by professor Fred Halliday on several levels. He writes that the target of hostility in the modern era is not Islam and its tenets as much as it is Muslims and their actions, suggesting that a more accurate term would be """"Anti-Muslimism.""""[34] Poole responds by noting that many Islamophobic discourses attack what they perceive to be Islam's tenets, while Miles and Brown write that Islamophobia is usually based upon negative stereotypes about Islam which are then translated into attacks on Muslims.[35][36] Halliday also states that strains and types of prejudice against Islam and Muslims vary across different nations and cultures, which is not recognized in the Runnymede analysis. Miles and Brown respond by arguing that """"the existence of different ‘Islamophobias’ does not invalidate the concept of Islamophobia any more than the existence of different racisms invalidates the concept of racism.""""[35] Halliday argues that the concept of Islamophobia unwittingly plays into the hands of extremists.[34]
British writer and academic Kenan Malik believes that the charge of Islamophobia confuses discrimination against Muslims with criticism of Islam, and that it is used to silence critics and Muslim reformers. He writes that the extent to which Muslims are more vulnerable to social exclusion and attacks than other groups is frequently and allows for a culture of victimhood, where all failings are attributed to Islamophobia. Islamophobia is not a form of racism, in his view, because Islam is a belief system.[37] This analysis is criticized by Inayat Bunglawala from the Muslim Council of Britain and Abdul Wahid from the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir.[38] Bunglawala writes that Malik's argument is limited to overt acts of violence against Muslims, without recognizing less overt forms of prejudice or discrimination. By ignoring non-violent examples of Islamophobia, Malik's commentary """"makes a mockery of victims of prejudice by pretending they have not been discriminated against,"""" according to Bunglawala.[38]

In the wake of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, a group of 12 writers signed a statement in the French weekly satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in March 2006, warning against the use of the term Islamophobia to prevent criticism of """"Islamic totalitarianism"""". The novelist Salman Rushdie was among these signatories.[39] These views are shared by Dutch law professor Afshin Ellian.[40] Critics cite the case of British journalist Polly Toynbee, who was nominated in May 2003 for the title of """"Most Islamophobic Media Personality of the Year"""" at the 'Annual Islamophobia Awards' overseen by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, for claiming that Islam """"... imposes harsh regimes that deny the most basic human rights.""""[41]

In an article called """"Fighting Islamophobia: A Response to Critics"""", Assistant Professor Deepa Kumar writes that the modern-day demonization of Arabs and Muslims by US politicians and others is racist and Islamophobic, and employed in support of an unjust war. About the public impact of this rhetoric, she says that """"One of the consequences of the relentless attacks on Islam and Muslims by politicians and the media is that Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise."""" She also chides some """"people on the left"""" for using the same """"Islamophobic logic as the Bush regime"""". She concludes with the statement """"At times like this, people of conscience need to organize and speak out against Islamophobia.""""[42]
Johann Hari of The Independent has criticized the use of the term by organizations like Islamophobia Watch, arguing that liberal Muslims interested in reform are le",0

I'm highly amazed by the fact that this debate rages on. If I may interject, Aleta formed a subsection entitled Arbitrary Page Break. Note using the word Arbitrary over say, Random? Are we going to throw a huge fuss over the inclusion of a more sophisticated word? Sobriquet is quite clearly at least somewhat different from Nickname, otherwise there would be only one article encompassing both words. My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade-level vocabulary into it as a means of providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to """"dumb down"""" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there's Simple English to cater to that need. So, that's my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don't know what a word means, just look it up.

"Regular disclaimer on vandal User:Rovoam 

Dear fellow Wikipedians,

This IP is just one of a whole army of anon IPs used by a well-known vandal User:Rovoam, who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of Wikipedia as THE most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in Wikipedia so far.

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkey-related entries, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, Arran (Azerbaijan), Urartu, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan (disambiguation), Turkey, Kura-Araxes culture, Nakhichevan, Safavids, Karabakh, Khojaly, Khojaly massacre, Stepanakert, Khankendi, Ganja (city), Baku Demographics of Azerbaijan, History of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani language, Azeri, Caucasus, History of Turkey, Oghuz Turks, Ottoman Empire, Turks, Turkic languages, Turkic peoples, Mannaeans and even Template:Europe (removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list).

He also vandalized user pages and talkpages, including User:Tabib, User:Tony Sidaways, (user page and talkpages), User talk:Rdsmith4, User talk:CryptoDerk  (talkpages), User:Weyes, User:Dante Alighieri, User:Chanting Fox.

Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to User:Tony Sidaway, User:Codex Sinaiticus, User:Isomorphic, User:Who, User:Dbachmann, the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

I'm not quite sure how this works, but your wrote in my deletion review, """"you say that your name and address are available, but your contributions to Wikipedia are pseudonymous.""""

Does this mean I hadn't registered? I did so last night, and not under a pseudonym as most people have. I always use my real name in signatures.

And I don't know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no """"post"""" link.

Thanks,
Dennis Bathory-Kitsz
bathory@bathory.org
bathory@maltedmedia.com

Thanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear.  Whether you register or not doesn't really matter since anyone can register under any name.  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W. Bush (at least, if it's not already taken).  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently.  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself.  

That's what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration, even if you say that it's your real name, is technically a pseudonym.  It is not independently verified against some external identity database.  And for the most part, that works out very well on Wikipedia.  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits, not by making claims to outside credentials.

By the way, anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs.  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system.  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do, attempt to mimic your pattern of speech (well, writing really) and make subtle edits just to discredit you.  That, in fact, is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia.  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users, we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit.  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia.  But those are all manual checks.  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.

Likewise, no one can inherently trust the email address.  The way internet domains are set up, anyone could register bathory.org and create any email name they wanted.  Like Wikipedia accounts, emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority.  And that's before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.

Most people are honest.  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn't matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not.  That's why Wikipedia has a policy against original research (which we mean as """"a contribution or assertion based on personal experience"""") and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large, well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.

Sorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security.  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours.  How can a bank know that you're really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?  How do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible.  Unfortunately, there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database - something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate.  

Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox now.  Thanks for your message.

To post to my Talk page, just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia.  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the """"edit this page"""" tab at the top.  That will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki-markup symbols.  You should also get in the habit of signing your posts on Talk pages.  You can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes (~~~~).  When you save the page, the MediaWiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date-timestamp.

Again, welcome to Wikipedia.   (talk) """,0

Considering that particular image is of a transwoman in a gay pride parade, I would think it is fairly appropriate for a section on """"Transgender in contrast with sexual orientation,"""" as it does a good job at illustrating the often complicated relationship between the two concepts.

"""Hello, I wrote Jack Lynch, Professor at Rutledge Univ. of 18th Century Literature. His talks includes works involving dictionaries. He responded (concerning definition of dictionary) with """"dictionary"""" has had a wide range of applications over the centuries.  Since 1631, the word """"dictionary"""" has been used with this meaning:

    By extension: A book of information or reference on any
    subject or branch of knowledge, the items of which are
    arranged in alphabetical order; an alphabetical encyclopædia as a Dictionary of Architecture, Biography, Geography, of the Bible, of Christian Antiquities, of Dates, etc.

There are all sorts of reference works we'd be likely to call
other things  encyclopedias, gazetteers, and so on  that have been called dictionaries by their makers.  In these cases,

    the essential sense ‘word-book’ is supplanted by the
    accidental one of ‘reference book in alphabetical order’
    arising out of the alphabetical arrangement used in modern
    word-books.. My reason for contacting Professor Lynch was the result of a curriculum director denying my published phonetic dictionary to her school relating that the reference book was not a 'real' dictionary. Now the dictionary is in public library collections in Canada, Mexico, The Netherlands and, of course, since it's an American English Phonetic Dictionary, is in over 400 U.S. public libraries. I am the lexicographer and would like to include """"Gabby's Wordspeller & Phonetic Dictionary"""" into the dictionary collection. And, since it's the only known phonetic dictionary currently in existence in either book or digital form, it has no category to list itself. Does it belong in a sub-category or does it require it's own category? There may be others come along now that this one has made the light of day.

The article on O.J. Simpson's murder case at Wikipedia is entitled O. J. Simpson murder case. Calculating numbers of countries is tangential to the legal aspect, as explained above  basically, most free countries that had relations renewed relations, never having recognized the legality of the forcible annexation. Many countries did not have relations prior to the occupation, because many were not sovereign back then (e.g., India was part of the British Empire, etc.  a list is available here ). I have nothing against including information on who did and who didn't recognize the annexation within the article, and the article should include information on the """"lameness"""" of continuity, too.

"""The Green Fairway Estates is an Alexander Construction Company housing development in Palm Springs, California.

Designed and constructed in the mid-century modern style of the period, the Green Fairway Estates tract is perched on the edge of Tahquitz Golf Course in the southern part of the city. The fairway homes begin near the corner of Lakeside Drive and Brentwood and snake their way down the street continuing on to a portion of Pebble Beach. Each home was built according one of nine master floor plans, each theme being repeated only two or three times due to the limited number of homes that were constructed prior to 1965  the year that the Alexanders died in a plane crash. Fortunately for the development, however, a number of Green Fairway Estates were completed prior to or soon after this terrible accident.

The Green Fairway Estates are in many ways the """"Brigadoon"""" Alexanders of Palm Springs, as very few people  even die-hard modernists  know about the neighborhood. Many of the Green Fairway homes are executed in an Asiatic or South Pacific style, influenced no doubt by the sense of Eastern exoticism being brought home by World War II soldiers. Construction features include A-frame roofs, lava rock facades, Aztec motifs, and other """"exotic"""" features. With floorplan names like The Royal Singapore and The Maracaibo, the whimsical ideals and themes of the period are in full force. 

The architect responsible for these models was architect Donald Wexler  architect of the Palm Springs International Airport and the now famous North End steel homes. The area surrounding the tract was originally surveyed and developed by the Westview Development Company in 1958. Westview Development Corporation was operated by Chicago residential and commercial developer Morton Zuckerman (president) and vice-president Frank Bogert, mayor of Palm Springs. In charge of sales was realtor and developer George Gannon. The designer of the golf course was Lawrence Huges.""",0

"Energy certificates  It is assumed there is some reason why users continually refer to energy credit while it has been pointed out that this is a misnomer in regard to Technocracy ideas. 
Energy Accounting is a hypothetical system of distribution, which would record the Energy used to produce and distribute goods and services consumed by citizens in a Technate. The units of this accounting system would be known as Energy CertificatesThese would replace money in a Technate, but unlike traditional money or currencies, energy certificates could not be saved or earned, only distributed evenly among a populace. The amount of certificates given to each citizen would be calculated by determining the total productive capacity of the technate and dividing it equally. The Energy Certificates themselves would probably not have to be physically used by the populace, as the system would be computerised. In energy accounting the Technate would use information of Natural resources, industrial capacity and citizen’s purchasing habits to determine how much of any good or service was being consumed by the populace, so that it could match production with consumption.

The reason for the use of Energy Accounting serves to ensure the highest possible standard of living as well as equality among the Technate’s citizenry, as well as prohibit spending that is beyond the productive capacity of the technocracy.Energy Accounting An article on Energy Accounting as proposed by Technocracy Inc. Technocrats point out that energy accounting is not rationing; it is a way to distribute an abundance and track demand.

Yes, the graph is misleading, but many textbooks and research papers have similar Arrhenius plots which do not show the true y-axis.

CBDunkerson,
I hope this comment on my own talk page is not considered intervention. (I see I've been unblocked.)

I did not mean to suggest that MONGO was purposely inserting information as part of his job. The only reason I said """"I would not be surprised"""", is because this has been going on for a while now and Wikipedia has not stopped it. What else am I to think? (Although I admit to not being familiar with Wikipedia's procedures.) Still, that comment by me is nothing compared to what MONGO's been getting away with.

(Also just noticed this btw.)

Wikipedia is supposed to be NPOV which is why MONGO should steer clear of the 9/11 pages.

An examination of the exchanges between MONGO and myself here is a good example:

MONGO seems content with personal attacks: """"who cares how many misguided folks there are"""".

His comments are clearly ad hominem personal attacks towards me, and many others.

The following, from this page, shows he's content with namecalling as well. I removed an external link to a namecalling site, MONGO reverts me leaving the following statement: I like this weblink...it summaries things quite well

I apologize for any insinuations on my part, but also must stress my own attempts at a NPOV.

I'm sure we all agree, from MONGO's own statements here that he is neither apologetic nor neutral:

""""The POV pushers that try to add nonsense to the articles related to the 9/11 events have been told repeatedly that the vast majority of their """"contributions"""" to those article violated numerous policies. This doesn't seem to stop them. This editor I blocked routinely reverts those that support the concensus verison and yes, conspiracy theorists is what they are...they are not researchers. Simply put, and I won't apologize for this not being more civil, I will continue to block POV pushers that disrupt the discussion pages and the articles with nonsense. Two other admins responded to the unblock request and did not unblock this editor. I then moved the early parts of this conversation from an article talk page to here for all to see. It is ludicrus to assume that I was doing anything other than to ensure that the POV pushers of nonsense know that there is a limit to the level of disruption that needs to be tolerated.""""

If MONGO calls this paper, which has been peer reviewed by two physicists before being accepted for publication in a book, """"nonsense"""", obviously he is not NPOV

The part about being """"well-endowed"""" seems factually wrong, or at least a poor (ie very subjective) choice of words. Flexibilty is the main factor. Also, the topic seems to imply that this front-bend method is the only way. I've tried the front-bend but cannot quite do it.

I had already been told why they weren't vandalism?  The reasoning offered was insufficient.  I quoted from the rules.  I showed where he broke the rules.  That was never refuted.  
I warned a vandal.  He reverted the warning more than once.  He never replaced it with one that he felt was more appropriate.  How can I not assume you are biased in this matter?  You are carrying on a very fascinating conversation with him on your talk page about groking or whatever, and I get blocked?  I make one comment you deem inappropriate and denounce it as """"scathing""""?  
Let's look at the wrong behavior Daedalus engaged in on WP:ANI just now:
""""I knew he wouldn't really notice the block...""""  That's false.  I noticed the block.
I'm done assuming good faith with you.  WP:AGF  blatant.
...you're trolling for some kind of response.""""  False, and fails to assume good faith.
""""You have so far been nothing but disruptive."""" False, and basically the same kind of comment I just got a one week block for.
""""...the way you warned those IPs is classified as a personal attack."""" False, and false statements about other editors are not allowed under the civility rules.
""""You've been nothing but rude since you got here...""""  False, as his statement contains an absolute.  Even using the most liberal definition of rude, I have not been """"nothing but rude...""""
""""...the user claimed that I was ready to resign...""""  False, and that represents a serious misrepresentation of my comment.
""""this information that he claimed to have had(but of course, did not) about me resigning...""""  False, as I never claimed to have information about him resigning.  Patently false.
""""...that was a twinkle edit summery, an edit summery that is created automatically by the script when in use...""""  Using automation isn't a defense to bad edits or edit summaries.
""""I removed your message from my review...""""  He concedes to vandalism.
""""...you might be something else...""""  Obvious failure to assume good faith.
""""Are you sure you read that entire page?""""  Sarcasm during a heated debate is quite clearly incivility.
As a side note, I see Redvers has accused me of calling established editors """"vandals"""" on Wikipedia.  As far as I remember, that too is false.  I said Daedalus969 committed vandalism, and I said he was on the side of vandals, but I never called him a vandal.  Keep in mind also that what Redvers just did, by the rules, was incorrect.   
Yet, for my one alleged mistake, I get a one week block.  Daedalus, on the other hand, gets not so much as even one warning?  This is a mockery.  How I am I supposed to think, given the evidence, that you weren't doing anything other than looking for one mistake on my part, whether real or imagined, to hit me with a block?  You're having a friendly conversation with this guy while he's committing vandalism, incivility, personal attacks, page blanking, false statements, and bad edit summaries, and I get toasted for one arguable slip?  No, no, no, """"scathing"""" slip.  Please.  
Note also that many of his bad moves such as this have absolutely no merit.  Please tell me, how much of his nonsense was I supposed to be able to endure?  The deck was stacked.  He's breaking the rules while making accusations against me, and I'm expected to turn the other cheek how many times?  I guess since I said I was done in my last WP:ANI post, it might have seemed like the last chance to hit me with a block, rather legitimate or not.

 Lead needs to meet MOS standards 

As it stands, the lead breaks MOS in several major ways:

 MOS:INTRO#Introductory text - In that is does not """"briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article"""".
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - In that it gives WP:UNDUE emphasis to male rape in the UK, yet section in """"Prevalence"""" covers 6 countries from which other examples could have been given. To quote MOS, """"emphasis given to material should reflect its relative importance to the subject"""" – male rape in the UK is no more important that in any other country in the world, therefore it should not be used as a singular example because this does not represent a worldwide view, particularly as anything related to anal sex differs per culture, religion and by law.
 The examples break the MOS:INTRO#Provide an accessible overview guideline which states: """"Do not hint at startling facts without describing them."""" The UK percentages are quoted without sufficient background to explain their relevancy this early in the article, there is no context because the lead is very short and uninformative.
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - """"Significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article"""" – the stated UK <3% and <5% figures are not mentioned in Male rape#United Kingdom, which would be a more appropriate place to account for these percentages, than in the lead in this disconnected manner.

The lead needs rewriting be someone who has contributed to this article and knows the sources well, it should be much longer based on the article's current length, it should be balanced and not given to undue examples from cherry-picked county data, per WP:NPOV.

Hi Padma and Nat!
Padma, I can understand your desire and, frankly, I see that there is precedence for it.  At a prior instantiation of this dab page (here), there was in fact a header, """"In Buddhism."""" I also agree with Nat insomuch that I think there is merit in only making changes to articles when merited and I guess Nat is focusing us again on the merit of the inserted/reverted/inserted/reverted/inserted text.  I apologize then for my perhaps putting the cart before the horse.
I think the inserted text contains two significantly different types of information, so I'd like to explore their merits independently.  I'm gonna create two subheaders below to facilitate this.  (talk) 

 Bath, Batha, Tabaath 
The first inserted/reverted sentence reads:
In Islam, the Arabic text Bath, Batha and Tabaath is found in the Qu'ran 62:2 Sura Al-Jumua The Qu'ran, Sura 62:2 http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/quran/06201.htm and is believed to be refering to Buddha.Maulana Abdul Haque Vidyarti, Muhammad in World Scriptures Vol 3 pg.1007

The (hidden) references are:
 The Qu'ran, Sura 62:2
 http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/quran/06201.htm
 Maulana Abdul Haque Vidyarti, Muhammad in World Scriptures Vol 3 pg.1007

So, it appears to me that the reason that this sentence is pertinent to the word """"Buddha"""" is because it identifies a possible referent in the Qu'ran to the Buddha (or a buddha?).  Since this article is about definitions of the word """"Buddha"""" per se — and not about the historical/mythic Buddha or other buddhas — it seems to me that this sentence is inappropriate for this article.  It should go in the appropriate article (e.g., possibly Gautama Buddha or Buddhahood).  Right?  Does this make sense?  This dab page is about the word """"Buddha"""" and contains pointers to articles that then provide meanings to this word.  The above sentence alludes to the meaning of """"Buddha"""" as Gautama Buddha (or, again, perhaps Buddhahood, still not clear to me from the sentence -) ).  Perhaps in terms of semantic cohesion, it would best fit in Gautama Buddha in world religions?  What do y'all think?   (talk) 

 Buddha (Arabic) 
The second inserted/reverted sentence reads:
The origin of the word Buddha in Arabic is; of descent, or he roused him, and put into action. Buddha Foretels The Advent of Muhammad

The (hidden) reference is:
4. Buddha Foretels The Advent of Muhammad

Here this sentence does in fact provide a new instance of the word """"Buddha,"""" separate from the existing denotations (of Gautama Buddha, Buddhahood, Buddharupa, etc.).

This sentence appears to fail to meet either of these suggested standards.  Perhaps if not worthy of an entry in the WP encyclopedia, might it be worth an entry in the Wiktionary (here)?

 Rape is a gender-specific crime. In Scotland, it can only be committed by males upon females, which appears to mean by persons biologically male at birth upon persons born biologically female. It is, therefore, a crime of specific personal violence perpetrated on females. [...] The act of rape must consist of penetration of the victim's vagina by the accused's penis.

 I do understand your point.  I do accept that often times """"military occupation"""" and """"occupied territories"""" are terms that go hand-in-hand.  My contention is that the nuances surrounding how the terms are used justify seperate pages.  If you can find for me some source stating that """"all occupied territories involve military occupation"""" and """"all military occupations create occupied territories"""" I'll join your effort.  However, lacking this I think you will have to achieve consensus for your arguement that the pages ought to be merged.
  Re Article 6 of GCIV - Again, I think perhaps you are being a little to legalistic regarding your definitions.  Remember that terms like """"Murder""""/""""execution""""/""""occupied territory""""/""""crime against humanity"""" have legal definitions, and definitions in the popular psychi defined outside law.  Starting from a legalistic definition is a good idea, but we shouldn't be entirely focused on that definition.  I think a useful way to go about looking at the popular psychi is by examining news articles, and seeing how they treat the terms.
 Shuki -  Consensus on something that is not verifiable is simply the majority of 'seems to me'.  I think you realize that in discussing definitions of terminology WP:V is often difficult/impossible.  Furthermore, I'm simply stating the opinion that """"It seems to me the terms are different."""" and asking PBS to verify otherwise. I think the only option here will ultimately be to seek consensus. 
 I guess I'm interested really in the larger question, which is, when dealing with terms of this nature is there anyway of really arriving at definitions besides consensus? I think not.  I also think there a huge morass of pages & articles where we could have simliar disputes.    """,0

He failed to achieve cumulative average score for his favorite school he always dreamt of, at age 17. He was arrested when 24, interrogated for days and put in solitary cell confinement for two months. He was 25 when sent to exile. When his colleague associate and close friend that is one year older than him was declared a hero by the association that he was serving, nobody noted him. When he was fighting to save cities from foreign occupations at age 30, his hometown fell to the enemy. His superior lobbied for him to be sent away to get rid of him when he was 30. He was left idle at his new location and could not get paid for months. He was in a hospital in Vienna for renal treatment confined to a bed for months lonely when he was 37. When returned to work, the army he would command was disbanded. He was fired by the Minister of Defense at age 38. He owned no civilian clothes to wear, no money saved and had to borrow a coat from a friend. An arrest warrant was issued for him the same year. A death order was issued for him when 39. He became the President of the Turkish republic when he was 42. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk read 18 thousand volumes of books in which over 200 000 lines are highlighted. Tens of thousands of sidenotes were entered. When found with red weepy eyes, he said his only worry was burning eyes which he took care of yards of soft fabric he'd ordered by his side to dry his eyes.

"""==Hitohiro Saito==
Hitohiro Saito, the son of Morihiro Saito, was a child when he trained with Ueshiba. I see no reason to quote his memories of osensei. There are dozens of osensei's students we could rather quote, but let's stay out of that. / 

Uchi-deshi
The new piece on notable uchi-deshi needs to be fleshed out.  

Biography
I would like to see the biography expanded a bit while avoiding style or author specific references.  It's a bit redundant when the points are made elsewhere - about 20% of Ueshiba's Biography was talking about Saito and Ueshiba's son each which have their own entries.  The links are adequet for finding the information.  

I expanded the biography being careful not to exclude information already there. 

 Would someone adress why in the section on Deguchi there is very little information on his encounter
 with the chinese army, I mention this because I believe the """"dodging balls of white light"""" story 
should be first in the section of """"awakenings """" 
that led to the roots of aikido. This story is very prevalent in aikdo literature 
and I wonder why it is not included.128.192.36.80  

 Soke Morihei Ueshiba 

I noticed that the """"Soke"""" is the name for """"founder of a style"""", (martial arts). Should Ueshibas article include this title?—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 

Absolutely not.  Soke is a title used by some Japanese martial arts to refer to the founder or head but I have never heard the term used in Aikido.  In Japan Ueshiba M. is sometimes referred to as Kaiso which means founder and in fact this term is far more commonly used than O sensei which seems to be a Western affection.  I have actually run into Aikidoists mortally offended by another art using the term O sensei as if it somehow slights Ueshiba M..  Both Kaiso and O sensei tend to be used primarily within the Aikikai and its newer derivatives.  In the older styles it is much more common to just hear Ueshiba sensei but then again they do not have the confusion of familial succession.  Personally I would like to see O sensei removed from the articles orther than a mention that some Aikidoists refer to him as such but I think that would raise a few hackels. 

Hackles be dammed I reduced the number of O sensei's in the text and clarified its usage a tad. I have never heard one Japanese Shihan use the term O sensei while in Japan.  Not saying they don't just that its not common. 

Well it's fine by me. I only asked because I noticed Gozo Shioda is referred to as """"Soke Gozo Shioda"""" on the official Yoshinkan website. When I first saw it I figured that if Shioda had a """"Soke""""-title then Ueshiba should too. Oh, by the way, my own aikido club (Ki-aikido) usually just say """"Ueshiba sensei"""" or """"Ueshiba"""". I cant actually remember anyone using the phrase O-sensei other than in a few introductionary speeches.
 

Interesting point about Yoshinkan I am more familiar with them using the term Kancho but it is their choice. Perhaps they didn't use Kaiso as not to confuse Shioda with Ueshiba.  Soke would not be a wrong usage for either man just in the case of Ueshiba it was not the term used.  I am going to ask a Yoshinkan Honbu Instructor his opinion on this.  At Shodokan Honbu (Tomiki's dojo) it is always Ueshiba sensei and interestingly Tomiki is always refered to as either Shihan or sensei - no other titles.  In Ki society how is Tohei sensei refered to?  

Tohei? Well I suppose it's mostly just """"Tohei-sensei"""" and/or """"Tohei"""" for mentionings in day to day training. (to say Tohei without the """"-sensei"""" might sound disrespectful in Japan but it is not in Sweden )) As for the official, formal titles of both Koichi Tohei and Kenjiro Yoshigasaki I have no idea. My club belongs to the latters Ki no Kenkyukai Internationale organisation by the way.

 Controversy - a litltle balance, maybe? 

I'm fully aware that most of the authors of this articles are pro-Kerry or at least anti-Bush, but should it be quite so obvious to the reader?  

Actually, the main part of the article (while not always completely balanced)has a fair amount of give-and-take, attempting to lay out each side's statements and the other's responses.  It's clear that we have some very different opinions, but we're making some good headway here.

BUT the """"Controversy"""" section is almost entirely attacks from one side(about two dozen sentences), the long list of allegedly significant """"ties"""", and numerous (often angry) quotes from Kerry's team and supporters (including many in the media), many of which add little or no actual information or argument for their position.  On the other side we find a few brief Bush-Cheney denials, and maybe two quotes.  Fine, if you're trying to sound like an LA Times editorial.  But I didn't think that's what we were after here.

(And, of course, there is the insistence that certain responses to charges are not relevant, even if these are the actual responses Bush, et.al. are making.   I didn't think it was our job to judge the strength of each side's argument simply to seek to represent it fairly.)

Wow, interesting information.  First, let me say that I don't doubt the truth of what you're saying.  However, because the resignation has not yet been published in a reliable source, it qualifies as original research, which is not permitted on Wikipedia.  Typically, this type of information would have to be removed from an article.  Given that you do have first hand knowledge of the situation, however, I'll leave it in with the """"citation needed"""" tag for now and hopefully a source will be available soon (I'll look tomorrow).  I feel comfortable with leaving the information for a few days with the citation tag while looking for a source, however, another editor could come along and justifiably remove it.

This is a very simple non-issue. Bagramyan enlisted into the DRA army and fought within its ranks in very crucial (and famous to Armenians) battles against the invading Turks. When you join an army, you are going to fight by its side which Bagramyan did, especially during that time when the Turks were a few km away from Yerevan. The battles (especially Sardarabad) were battles that would determine life or death of the newly established republic. What he joined, became or did after or during the fall of the DRA has nothing to do with what he did prior to it. The DRA's """"brief experience of independence"""" does not disqualify Bagramyan's service to the country and to its survival.
 
Also, """"Unless you can provide factual information that he was a commissioned officer in the DROA, I would have to assume that he supported Communism, or at least Socialism"""".

 What is Linga? 

What is the Linga? And what is the meaning of the symbol? There are few ways to explain the meaning and the symbol of Linga.

1. Linga as Arthabrahma or phenomenal manifestation

Linga is the amorphous representation of Shiv and can be regarded as the highest emblem of Shiv because of its least anthrophomorphic nature. Shiv, Parabrahman, is the highest Divine Principle in intimate union with Divine Power, the Parashakti. The only positive qualities of this Divine Principle are Shat, Chit, and Anand. He is conscious of Himself i.e. He has Atmavimarsha. He is the cosmic Purusha (person) but is Nirakar - has no particular form and has no distinguishing mark. He is therefore inconceivable. """"God cannot be known by the mind or the physical senses"""" is consensus of all the sages. It is in this sense Herbert Spensor speaks of God as """" Unknown and unknowable."""" What he means is that Deity per se is """"Unknown and Unknowable."""" John Fiasco further argues that """"Deity is unknowable to the extent of it is not being manifested to consciousness through the phenomenal world knowable but knowable in order of its phenomenal manifestations: knowable in a symbolic way as the power of being rhythmic life of the universe; knowable as eternal source of moral law."""" If we accept this, then Shiv is inconceivable. But if He is not conceived, how can he be worshipped? Yet religious mind craving for eternal happiness cannot be satisfied without worship and cannot do without worship. He, therefore, requires some kind of representation or symbol of God. Without some concrete symbol of God, God would be a formless abstraction devoid of meaning to him/her. Hence it for those, who cannot digest abstract ideas of God, temples are built and images representing Gods in different powers and attributes are consecrated. Whatever may be said against images in the temples, rituals, and ceremonies, the fact remains that they are indispensable at a certain stage of the spiritual evolution life. 

Nirakar Shiv is Amurtha (formless) in his indistinct condition, and is Murtha or Sakar in his manifest condition –manifest in the form of universe. Shiv assumes eight-fold forms and is, therefore, called as Ashtamurthi. Then the Linga represents the whole universe appearing hemispherical placed on something. The Linga, the amorphous symbol of Shiv, thus, represents the Murtha form of Shiv. Hence, the Linga signifies Alinga or Shiv that has no special form or mark. The circular base with round semi-spherical top placed on it fits the description of the idea of Murthavthva.

2. Linga as Shabdabrahma

Shivaparabrahman is the cosmic Purusha having Atmavimarsha. He first vibrates in his Leele (play or amusement) towards creation. The vibration is Nada (a loud roar), the first expression as Nama or name. From his Nada proceeds Bindu (dot), i.e. the form. The couplet Nama and Rupa or Nada and Bindu are known as Onkara or Pravana. The Bindu is the disc-like Peetha and Nada is the line that supervenes the Peetha. The line stands on the Bindu like a cylinder with a rounded top. All this forms the Linga.

3. Linga as the Visvarupa

Shivaparabrahman has no particular form but is all-formed. He is, therefore, called Visvarupa. He is the creator of the Universe and assumes all forms in the Universe. He is hidden in all creatures, and pervades all and forms inner souls of all. He is said to have a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet. He has hands and feet in all directions. The semi-spherical top that supervenes the circular base represents this description of cosmic Purusha, with whom His devotees identify Shiv. The round top on the circular base really consists of thousands of heads, each of the size of a point. The sides of the cylindrical figure represents equally thousands of heads, eyes, and faces in all directions. The semi-spherical top, resembling the visible horizon, is truly symbolical of the universe that surrounds the earth on all sides. Though the symbol has no eyes and feet, or eyes and ears, it has thousands of hands and feet, heads, eyes, and ears in all directions, just as a circle has no face all around but it has faces in all directions at every point of the circumference. Thus the Linga is the closest possible representation of such formless or all-formed God Shiv. 

It is customary in nature that all classes of things in universe must have different shapes and forms. The so-called """"Gods class"""" must have different shapes and forms, though nobody knows what those shapes and forms should be. It is only the fancy of the human beings that has endowed Gods with some anthrophomorphic forms. But there is no proof of that. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that Gods have shapes and forms different from those of human beings as human beings have shapes and forms different from those of other animals,",0

"Mary Ambrose was not Robert Palmer's girlfriend at the time of his death, although they had been involved in a casual relationship. However, during the time period that Mary Ambrose was involved with Robert Palmer, she was involved with a number of men, even having two children, in 2001 and 2002, with men known to Robert Palmer. Mary Ambrose's son born in 2001 was fathered by Mick Carter, who was Robert Palmer's manager, until Palmer fired him in the second week of September. Unfortunately, since Mick Carter was the first person to discover that Robert Palmer had died, he took the opportunity to lie to the press on a number of points, including naming Mary Ambrose as Robert Palmer's girlfriend. Robert Palmer was no longer involved with Mary Ambrose before his death. His only contact with her at that point was trying to iron out a settlement agreement with Ambrose ensuring that she would not give interviews about him, or discuss him with the press. Mick Carter was not fond of Robert's true girlfriend, in fact he disliked her intently. Robert Palmer hadn't told many people about Mick Carter's firing, opting to complete his publicity appearances in Paris for Drive before doing so. Carter was fully aware of this, and took advantage of the situation. When it was discovered what he had done, and the surfeit of bogus and incorrect information that he had provided to the press worldwide, the information was invalidated due to his firing and credibility issues. Because of his close friendship with Mary Ambrose, he saw a money making opportunity for them in Robert Palmer's death. Carter even went so far as to stage a 'hoax' interview on Mary Ambrose's behalf, entitled Robert Palmer Was Addicted To My Love. The article appeared on the 28th of September, two days after the death of Palmer. The interview allegedly took place by phone, backed up by a signed release. When the interview was challenged by the family as being false, the interview was basically Robert Palmer emoting about Mary Ambrose, who his children knew he was no longer involved with in any vernacular at the time of his death, the article was revealed to be a hoax. At the time Robert Palmer was allegedly giving this interview by phone, he was in fact in attendance at a social function accompanied by three friends of his, who vouched he was with them the entire time the interview was allegedly taking place. As for the release, it was proven that Robert Palmer's signature was forged, and not a very good forgery at that. The article was to appear in three parts, but once the publishers realized that the article was a hoax, they cancelled the publication of the other two parts of the article and invalidated the one part that they had ran.",0

 Article About Sizzla You Can Use 

Babylon has set up a system designed to keep black people enslaved and ashamed of their culture. The system is so structured that the only way for black people, is to look to the east and seek repatriation to the continent of their origin guided by the Trinity of Haile Selassie, Marcus Garvey and Immanuel and thier teachings.

 This is the message of Sizzla and it influences his music to the extent that he is being looked upon as the teacher and the inspiration for Jamaican youths who want to retain the basic culture of their African origins.

Sizzla's songs speak to poverty and hopelessness that pervades young Jamaica and obviously oppressed youths worldwide. Like Bob Marley, a couple of generations before him, he delivers a message which speaks to poverty, homelessness, police brutality, cultural pride and political and religious oppression.

        Born Miguel Collins,  Sizzla is a product of one of Jamaica's uptown ghettos, August Town.

        One of his earliest experiences of how unfair the social system is in Jamaica, was while he was in his mid-teens. In order to get into a Technical High School so he could learn a trade and have a better chance of earning a living, he had to leave High School , go back to pre-high and then apply to get into a High School which taught trades- Dunoon High School, where he studied Mechanical Engineering.

        Dunoon has a reputation of association with some of the best dancehall deejays from the city, including Shabba Ranks and Lady G. So with an inner inclination towards music, it wasn't surprising that while there, he started recording music.

        It was Homer Harris, the same man who gave Buju Banton his first break, who introduced him to top Jamaican saxophonist, Dean Frazier, (Musical Director for Philip """"Fattis"""" Burrell's Xterminator Family).

        """"Fatis"""" was delighted with his potential, decided to record him.

Sizzla, who had originally planned to follow in the footsteps of his mechanic father Aston, suddenly had a change of heart. He abandoned his mechanic training, came under the influence of Buju Banton and Shabba Ranks' cassettes and decided to stick to music.

        The auto industry loss was a tremendous gain for the music industry in Jamaica and indeed around the world.

        Since the start of 1997, Sizzla's popularity within the music industry has grown so rapidly, he is considered a musical phenomenon. His tunes fill the charts and sales have been so trmrndous that every reggae producer wished he had a Sizzla song to release and every sound system wants a Sizzla dubplate to be current.

        Touring with the Xterminator Family and star perfomer Luciano, has gained for him, tremendous experience and exposure and now Sizzla is about to move up the ranks and make his name as a musical prophet and messenger, in his own right""",0

If, according to you that is original research, then everything is original research, won't you say? If not in the gadhimai festival article then where should we give a chance to Hinduism as a religion of non-violence? The article attributes all the animal killings of the festival to Hinduism.

 Characteristic Saffir-Simpson Cat 4 Cyclone Larry Central pressure 920-944 mbar 915! mbar when landfall made Potential damages """"More extensive curtainwall failures with some complete roof structure failure on small residences. Major erosion of beach areas. Terrain may be flooded well inland."""" 55% of all buildings in Innisfail damaged. Entire banana crop and some of sugarcane crop demolished.

Storm surge4.0–5.5 m5.0m 1-minute average sustained winds210-245 kph 200km/h confirmed. Otherwise unknown, with gusts frequently exceeding 280kph. Conclusion Larry is indeed a category 4 cyclone at the very least, unless we are willing to ignore important factors for the sake of 10km/h of confirmed sustained wind.

I already have an article (American) claiming it was Cat 4. It's right [here. However, as you stated earlier, newsgroups are not an authority on the matter, are they? As for my friend , well what can I say to you? You have gone against all sound logic and called me a liar because I can't confirm 10km/h of sustained wind. I'm unsure if you even know what logic is. To you, it's all cold hard data, with stupidty thrown in for free. Your level of intelligence sickens me. You've also failed to note the case for central pressure, which was on par with most Cat 5 storms. What you're proposing is this: 

""""A cyclone that brought about more than the effects and damages of a typical Category 4 storm and that had the Central Pressure of a typical Category 5 storm, is in fact a mere Category 3, simply because it's confirmed/measured sustained winds were 5 knots below the """"cut-off"""" for Category 4.""""

For the rest of you: SS scale uses 1-minute averages. A 1-minute average of 200km/h was RECORDED about 30km north of where the cyclone crossed. I understand this is 10km/h less than the cut off for cat 4 (as stated above), but at least it puts estimates and what-nt to rest. Further, I'll leave the rest of my argument to logic, that is, if you have any.

Chip Berlet's intentional holding back of article progress
Far-left Hoxharian propagandist Chip Berlet is intentionally holding back the progress of the article, and recently removed information and work which took a very long time to build after going through numerous books which I own on the topic, he removed over 50 independent citations in a huge violation of WP:CENSOR, WP:EDIT, WP:OWN and WP:CITE to hold back information from the general public. Especially look at his vandalism of the """"Italian Fascism"""" section. If Chip Berlet in a conflict of interest removes this information again I WILL report his intentional destruction as vandalism. 

I placed th {{underconstruction}} tag at the top of the page for a reason, he should embrace the progressing of the article and respect the concept of the tag instead of trollishly reverting hours and hours of work just because he, in this communist agenda """"doesn't like it"""". Nobody has to ask the permission of Chip Berlet before working on the article and adding vertified information, you do not WP:OWN it or control who can contribute to it and you are not god. Here is what Chip Berlet would like to hold back from the general public who wish to learn about fascism (ie - the people who type """"fascism"""" into wikipedia);

A) what fascism is outside of boogieman cartoon depictions. Devotion to such anti-educational, anti-scholary stances on the part of Cberlet has already made this article decidedly inferior to every other encyclopedias coverage.
B) that Fascism considered itself a Third Position on the political scale, not """"far right"""", with its roots actually in defected members of the Italian Socialist Party (such as Mussolini himself) and anarchists such as the anarcho-syndicalists; not as berlet claims """"far rightists"""". This is a particularly inconvient truth for Chip Barlet who depends on the presenation of fascism as right wing, so that in the United States he can attack followers of the Republican Party. Concepts irrelevent to the entire rest of the world. If fascism is not rightist, Berlet's world crumbles to dust. 
C) the history of fascism, how and why it came about after WWI (Treaty of Versailles, Italy's transition from regionalism to nationalism), what happened in practice, who its intellectuals were, what the Philosopher of Fascism Giovanni Gentile's reason and idea for opposing liberalism and democracy was; the latter is perhaps the most striking by modern considerations and the reader will be wanting to know """"why would these intellectuals think this?"""".
D) Berlet would like to build a collection of names of what fascism """"opposes"""" and stack them all up in the intro. but he refuses to allow what it stands in support of and why; for example he removed the references to national syndicalism and corporativsm from the intro, absoutely essential pieces of this political system. He removed the reference to The Doctrine of Fascism and he removed the section which presents that it is hotlt disputed exactly which movements are and are not fascist apart from the National Fascist Party of Mussolini which is always called Fascist.
E) once again, despite the discussion above with R-41 and myself. Berlet has, against consensus and against WP:CITE entered into the article that fascism is """"race"""" and """"racial"""" orientated, when it has been presented that it specifically is NOT the case and the majority of scholars do not take that line. As racialism belongs to Adolf Hitler's national socialism not all of fascism in general; some scholars such as Jewish writer A.F.K. Organski dispute whether National Socialism is Fascist at all. So to type that fascism is """"racially orientated"""" in the intro is a complete and intentional deception, Berlet is well aware of this and his game is boooooring. That belongs in the intro of Nazism's article, as it already is there.
F) Berlet would like to cover up the fact that the Fascist government under Benito Mussolini waged war on the Mafia, shattering the criminals into little pieces with Cesare Mori leading the way. This is again, an incredibly inconvenient truth for Barlet, because his democratic nation the United States openly collaborated with Lucky Luciano to invade Italy in the first place and then made previously jailed Mafiosi mayors of Sicilian towns after the conquest. 

G) maybe unrelated to Berlet (unless its his other name), but Bobisbob with his IP rather than username, has several times attempted to cover up that Adolf Hitler's movement is called """"National Socialism"""" that is its full and correct title. I presume this editor is a socialist, who wants to distance the use of the word """"socialism"""" from what Hitler called his movement. Well tough luck son you can't go back and rewrite",0

  kinda.  I'll partially reverse that, for three reasons.  The main one stems from the argument I'm having on Wrestlemania XXVIII vis-a-vis the Daniel Bryan cash-in and the concept that appears to be getting rammed down my throat of WP:Crystal, even though I have demonstrated that not to be the case over there.  If putting Bryan, by the nature of the program and at this point and time, on the Mania XXVIII card is WP:Crystal, then the concept of the strippage and any Raw title match in Hampton, VA tomorrow night (7/25) is also, technically, WP:Crystal as well.

This redoubles when you look at the second reason.  We now know that SOMETHING is going on between Punk and WWE, and that this grand angle is going a fairly new and viral direction.  Still, end of the day, we can't source that he's under contract, but they are keeping it well under wraps.

The third reason is a timeline continuity-break in the storyline.  The best I can say (and what I posted today) is that the current title status is unknown.  Consider the following from the storyline:  The Board meeting which ended McMahon's tenure took place several hours before McMahon announced the tournament.  So, is the tournament valid?  Is the final valid?  Now, consider the timeline of the """"questionable decisions"""" involved.  Is the lifting of the suspension valid if the """"fire Cena"""" stipulation is not?  Is Cena the champ?  Is Punk the champ?  Is Alberto del Rio also #1 Contender on top of Senor Dinero el en Banco?  Is the Rey/Miz tournament final valid?  We have a storyline continuity break which probably will be addressed on the 7/25 RAW.  But, as of the moment, the entire current status is unknown.  Punk may well be entitled to this entire week as champion, or not even be entitled to a reign at all (though we do have official sourcing, as of the moment, to clear that entitlement for the moment)!  Anything else gets to WP:Crystal material as far as some are concerned here.    """,0

Your Uncivil Friends Refuted

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

Anti-Serb sentiment is an umbrella term or generalization, obviously it will be poorly sourced just as List of Massacres in the Kosovo war is a WP creation. We find a subject then we link sources/stories to it but many articles do not represent a real world phenomenon. The fact is that Serbophobia as a concept is not a """"myth"""" but it is confined to the nation's sympathizers and is rejected by the nation's detractors. Obviously Serbophobia is more degrading and more emphatic than """"anti-Serb sentiment"""" in that implies an outright hatred. Naturally no Serb can truly accept no nation recognizing their declared states in Croatia (Krajina) and Eatern Bosnia during the Yugoslav Wars, seeing a West-brokered peace deal in 1994 putting at end to Bosniak-Croat hostilities then all uniting for a joint attack to end the Serb rebel states alongside world powers and claiming that the unlawful grounds for existence of those states was that they were not AVNOJ entities - and then a few years later support the UCK in Kosovo, pushing from the first moment to have FRY forces expelled, succeeding after airstrikes then nine years later recognize Kosovo - no AVNOJ argument there. But it doesn't end there, Kosovo achieved widespread positive feedback from US recognition to """"welcoming of independence"""" from organizations such as the Basque authority in Spain - all entitled to their own opinions, but Serbs who claim Serbophobia are neither stupid nor blind to world events. You don't get the same positive and warm reception let alone recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia nor many other would-be states to exist or to have existed before being retaken by an aggressor (in the eyes of locals). These feats give Serbs to feel they are victims of international protectionism and that alone is enough to prove the sentiment. You're not going to convince them with fairy stories about how their heavy-handed 1990s oppression or disproportionate number of atrocities that time influenced on what side nations would eventually fall.

Have you in fact read the Wikipedia guidelines? I'm not trying to be snarky; it's an honest question, because you seem to have a few misunderstandings about the process here.

First, if you feel that anything in an article is inappropriate, whether it's the original text or a recent change, you can edit it. You don't have to ask me to """"reverse the changes"""". There are still rules of editing etiquette that apply, such as not just ping-ponging changes back and forth (see WP:3RR), and being willing to discuss differences of opinion on talk pages like this. But no one owns the article - not me, not you; no one has veto power, except for administrators; and there's no reason to ask anyone in particular to make changes for you. It's not as if I wiped out your text forever: it's all in the article history, which is pretty easy to use.

Second, WP articles are not to be written based on what you or anyone else may think are """"very logical reasons"""" to support a theory. It is fine to explain a particular person's or group's point of view on the subject, pro or con, as long as it's attributed clearly; but the encyclopedia itself is not in the business of saying what makes sense, and the purpose of the talk pages is not to argue about whether a theory is correct. Debates that might be very productive in the pages of a scientific journal are less so in an encyclopedia. This is particularly important when the theory has not yet reached wide acceptance as a scientific consensus - and I don't think you're claiming that it has. That is why I don't think the link from, for instance, SIV was appropriate; by stating that argument in the voice of the encyclopedia itself, it made it sound as if most researchers agree that this is a likely explanation. Again, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view - one of the absolutely crucial WP rules.

Third, on a more trivial note, it is basic WP etiquette to log in under your username before you make edits or comments (so people can see who is doing what); to use the standard """"~~~~"""" signature for your comments; and, when responding to a specific paragraph on a talk page, to indent your response immediately below it with """":"""" rather than copying and pasting the previous comment elsewhere.""",0

Speedy deletion of Eric and Dylan are great
 A tag has been placed on Eric and Dylan are great requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. —  (say whaaat?!)

Æµ§œš¹ There is an Afrocentiric view of the world and there is a non Afrocentric view.  As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora.  The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics.  The counterfeiters and plagiarizers that have for years attempted to filch the word Ebonics and with the intent to deceive used the word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other such appellations clearly have Hoary confused. [See Smith (1997) and Smith and Crozier (1998)].   In the “About Wikipedia” section on the main page of  Wikipedia we are told the following as the etymological origin or genesis of the word “Wikipedia”:  “Wikipedia (pronounced /ˌwɪkɨˈpiːdi.ə/ WIK-i-PEE-dee-ə) is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project based on an openly-editable model. The name """"Wikipedia"""" is a portmanteau of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning """"quick"""") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links to guide the user to related pages with additional information.”  Now, just as the word Ebonics is a is portmanteau of the words ‘ebony’ and ‘phonics’ the word or name Wikipedia is portmanteau of the words ‘wiki’ and ‘encyclopedia’.  According to the ‘About Wikikpedia’ section the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is from the Hawaiian word ‘wiki’ meaning ‘quick’ not the word ‘wickyapi’ an Algonquian Indian language from which the word ‘wickiup’ is derived.  Thus the word Wikipedia is not derived from the Algonquian Indian word ‘wikiyapi’ and it origin has nothing to do with the word’wickiup’ that means “a hut used by nomadic Indians of the arid regions of the western and southwestern U.S.” (see Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (2001:1347)  As defined by its author the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is not a portmanteau of the word ‘wicked’ and ‘pedophile’ and it has noting to do with “wicked pedophiles”.  User Hoary thinks it is allright to encompass meanings for the word ‘Wikipedia’ that the founders of ‘Wikipdeia’ never intended and defend the use of any and all counterfeit meanings on the web all over the world. 
I accept what is presented in quotes above as being the origin and true meaning of the name “Wikipedia”.   I believe the meaning posited for Wikipedia above is the only authenthic meaning of word ‘Wikipedia’.   I wonder how the author(s) originator(s) of the name ‘Wikipedia’ would feel if there were counterfeiters and plagiarizers going all over the world misrepresenting and outright mis-using the name “Wikipedia”?

 ArbCom elections 

Ciao, barts1a. I noticed you've made steps towards standing as a candidate in this year's ArbCom elections. Unfortunately, it does not look as if you meet the eligibilty criteria of having made 1,000 mainspace edits before November 114, 2010 so you will not be able to submit a candidacy (please correct me if I am wrong). Regards, Skomorokh 
I intend to run as this shows I have over 1,700 edits; more than qualifying me to stand for the position and at any rate this election needs all the candidates it can get.   
That link indicates you have 728 mainspace edits, not 1000 (and some of those 728 have been made since Nov 1st14th). Sorry, Skomorokh 
Either way I intend to run anyway. And if you look at the guideline for edits you will see that it actually says November 14, not November 1.   
My mistake, it is November 14 as you say. However, you still do not meet the threshold for article space edits and so are prohibited from running. Sincerely, Skomorokh 
You seem to have a rather strong position on this...   
My error regarding the date aside, it's pretty black and white. Sincerely, Skomorokh 
I have withdrawn my self-nomination, but I believe that the lack of nominees this time around is due to unfriendly messages such as above. I hope that I will have enough edits next time around to qualify.   
I apologise if you found my messages unfriendly, that was very much not my intention. You have the misfortune of being the first ineligible candidate this year, so I do not think this can be attributed as the reason for the lack of nominations. Best, Skomorokh 
CommentBarts1a, the requirement is for mainspace edits (not total edits). You don't appear to meet the requirement.  
No wonder candidates are so few and far between...   
There are many thousands of wikipedians who easily exceed those requirements, and while I don't know if the minimum requirements are the same as last year, I suspect that all the successful and most of the unsuccessful candidates in previous years had rather more than a thousand mainspace edits. Any explanation for the paucity of candidates would need to explain why fewer of the qualified candidates are standing. ''SpielChequers'' 
Too much paperwork (Mostly one editor's fault) and a week filled with people saying nasty things about you?  For most of us, RfA was enough, and I leaned my lesson last year.  

Barts1a, I'm not sure why you've requested comment on this. It is a black and white standard. I don't know the reason behind it, but I would guess it is to ensure that only Wikipedia contributors that have a certain level of experience and dedication to the project are allowed to run in the ArbCom elections. Of course, counting",0

"""Futper, between your editting history and your negative stereotyping comments against all Greeks (e.g. your comment above  '""""They just go by the narrow perspective of their national media""""') it makes it appear like you have an anti-Greek POV. That is what makes me suggest you are a FYROM supporter (it was not meant as a pejorative simply a description of your political leanings). If you wish others to believe you have a NPOV it would require a more careful selection of words on your part and a far more even handed editing history when it comes to the main article. (statistically speaking here, you delete facts that support Greek positions in far great frequency than you do FYROM ones. I can provide a detailed listing on request.).

As for the House Resolution. You made several points to marginalize the Senate bill condemning FYROM for propaganda (signed by Obama... possibly the next US President) based on low numbers. I therefore pointed out the House bill (which you have made absolutely no mention of) had over 120 members supporting it which I belive made it was one of the largest supported foreign bills of the year actually. I don't think it is unreasonable to suggest when a fair chunk of the government of the world's most powerful nation (heavily involved with mediating the naming issue) makes a complaint that severe... it should be completely negated from the article. As for you opinion that it (or a child bill) won't become more binding... my own opinion is that will largely be up to the behavior of FYROM government and whether they """"abstain from any form of `propaganda' against Greece's historical or cultural heritage"""".

Well that is not correct. If you are unwilling to learn the difference between in-universe and out-universe then I think editing articles dealing with fictional characters is not fair on editors who actually bothered to. The problem is the date of death field is part of the personal profile section of the info box. This means it is an in-universe element of the article; referring exclusively to events within the series. If the episode was set on a different date, to that it aired on - then a death featured within that episode would carry the date within the series. Fictional characters do not die from our viewpoint - they will always exist, they do not cease to exist, so we do not use our date. So maybe you need to have a rethink. I would personally hope that you take this on board before undoing valid edits and attempting to discredit editors. Not that it even matters, but I did watch the show. the 1 """,0

"Unethical actions by an admin named  

The context of the supposed WP:NPA violation is highly relevant.  My comment was made in response to an ideologically-motived 3RR violation report filed against me.  Since that wasn't working for him, Nandesuka figured I needed to be silenced, which is why he dug through the history and found this excuse after the fact.

Note that Nandesuka shouldn't even be involved in this in any official capacity, since he's an admin who has had many content disputes with me over his unalloyed support for cirumcising all penises.  As a member of the Snippies, he is too biased to participate in this case, and his actions show that he's a sore loser who is abusing his newly-gained admin rights to silence me so that I can't defend myself from the charges of 3RR violation.

Wikipedia has clear procedures on moving pages. Other than in exceptional circumstances all pages should be moved by following the instructions on the Requested Moves page. Unilateral moves can trigger edit wars, break links and cause a lot of problems. Please stop unilaterally moving pages, as you did with Kim Jong-il, and follow the correct procedure.

Block

I have reverted nationalist anti-Soviet propaganda, mass deletion and removing the mention of Nazi collaborationist war crimes in Participants in World War II about once a day. I have been blocked in circumvent of the rules by a POV admin. The article should be restored to the pre-edit war status

Nixer, you reverted that article four times. I have blocked you for only 24 hours, although your repeated 3RR violations would usually warrant more, as would your """"POV admin"""" remark above.  (T) 

Taking no position whether Nixer  deserves a block for revert warring, I must note that 4 reverts accumulated in 36, not 24 hours as per this. Staying under 3RR is no entitlement in any way and general revert warring is subject to admin's discretion blocks. However, in such case the admin should be uninvolved, unlike user:ProhibitOnions who was one of the editors who reverted Nixer. Again, I take no position on whether Nixer should be blocked for RV warring in general, just noting that technically 3RR is not there and blocking by admin who participates in article disagreement is highly inappropriate in such case.

All this aside, Nixer, you should cool down finally.  

Three of Nixer's reverts were within 24 hours and the fourth was the following morning, which I reverted, but subsequently restored. Furthermore, I am not a recent editor of this article, and am not thrilled by the attitude presented by either Nixer or the editors reverted; if there had been any genuine discussion, they might have been able to reach a compromise, as they were both presenting opposing national",0

The hardest-working, most experienced, most involved critic of this article has misgivings about mediation. Let's start now.
Is the CMT fringe?
If a consensus is reached to the effect this is a fringe theory, the article will need to make that clear in a way that is neutral. Once. Not over and over again in every nook and cranny. Sly, underhanded discredits like the top link in """"See also"""" being to Bible conspiracy theory make you (whoever put it there) appear to be sleazy and contemptible. It gives the impression that you play dirty, that the quality of your argument against the theory is so weak you need to apply Fox News persuasion techniques. I'm sure none of that is the case. But that's the impression it gives. 

And the word fringe need not be used. The word in general parlance carries a derogatory implication (marginalized and nutty), whereas the way we use it, fringe theory is """"not mainstream"""". Something like """"the theory is not widely accepted by mainstream theologians and historians"""" conveys it's place in the field without stooping to derision.

Personally, judging only on the quotes provided by Eugene in the FAQ, which are opponents speaking, but includes one proponent (I think - did I delete him?) who concedes the view is considered eccentric, and in the absence of any counter evidence, I have no choice but to conclude it is a fringe theory.

As far as I know it has been stated that several """"universes"""" do not fit into the actual accepted universe of Wold Newton which integrates with the DC comics universe thanks to Alan Moore. Thus Marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross-over connections or with the exception of Steven Rogers and Peter Parker whose worlds do not clash with the DC Universe chronology. As for Star Wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the Wold Newton Universe, only Star Wars takes place in an entirely different future-past element, basically a universe that predates that of the Earth. And Tolkien's universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm, the same applies to Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft and Warhammer. However the world of faeries is related thanks to King Arthur and Shakespeare as well as C.S. Lewis and Hans Christian Anderson/Brothers Grimm. Harry Potter's world also doesn't tie in to the Wold Newton as far as I have seen. And as for Looney Tunes and Disney the only way they might tie-in is through WHo Framed Roger Rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. Of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn't, the only reason I added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those """"universes"""" or """"worlds"""" were not present.

 My letter to NeinN 

I am not NeilN's psychiatrist, and, as I haven’t examined NeilN, I won’t diagnose him. But because NeilN has turned himself into a public laboratory of psychopathology, I want to talk about how I'd give direction to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality. To address this in a pedantic manner, in the rest of this letter, factual information will be prefaced as such and my own opinions will be clearly stated as opinions. For instance, it is a fact that people used to think I was exaggerating whenever I said that like other volage-brained sensualists, he has a finely honed ability to welsh on all types of agreements. After seeing NeilN precipitate riots these same people now realize that I wasn't exaggerating at all. In fact, they even realize that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, NeilN is drunk with power, which is why we must drive off and disperse the obdurate bohemians who manufacture outrage at his castigators by attributing to them all sorts of uppity fairy tales.

If the only way to stop the Huns at the gate is for me to fall prey to NeilN's rhetoric and obfuscation, then so be it. It would sincerely be worth it because he had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, NeilN gave us sensationalism, propagandism, and officialism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since NeilN claims to be supportive of my plan to confront and reject all manifestations of feudalism. Don't trust him, though; he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Before you know it, he'll treat traditional values as if they were rapacious crimes. Not only that, but some benighted bloodsuckers are actually considering helping NeilN cause one-sided inclinations to be entered into historical fact. How quickly such people forget that they were lied to, made fun of, and ridiculed by NeilN on numerous occasions.

It's scary how effectively NeilN has been making a mockery of the term """"disproportionableness"""". I deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained by this tragedy. I am currently working to understand the surrounding circumstances so as to improve our ability to plant markers that define the limits of what is untoward and what is not. We have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we strip the unjust power from those who seek power over others and over nature, or is it sufficient to put him in his place? In answer to that question I submit—and millions of people in this country and abroad unmistakably agree with me—that Bourbonism has served as the justification for the butchering, torture, and enslavement of more people than any other """"ism"""". That's why it's NeilN's favorite; it makes it easy for him to mute the voice of anyone who dares to speak out against him. You might think this is all pretty funny now, but I doubt I'll hear you laughing if, faster than you can say """"floccinaucinihilipilification"""", NeilN is successfully able to use paid informants and provocateurs to make higher education accessible only to those in the higher echelons of society. I've heard numerous complaints about his behavior. Many people I've talked to have complained that NeilN comports himself like a filthy pig, heedless of all needs but his own. Among these needs the paramount one seems to be the need to burn books. This backs up my point that he likes saying that better governance can be achieved by granting profitable concessions, permits, waivers, zoning variances, monopolies, and other such political machinations to his band. Okay, that's a parody—but not a very gross one. In point of fact, NeilN is extremely mawkish. In fact, my handy-dandy Mawkish-O-Meter confirms that prudence is no vice. Cowardice—especially NeilN's deplorable form of it—is. Now that you've read the bulk of this letter, it should not come as a complete surprise that some of the things NeilN says and some of the things he stands for are so feckless, it hurts to think about them. However, this fact bears repeating again and again, until the words crack through the hardened exteriors of those who would make a big deal out of nothing. I am referring, of course, to the likes of NeilN.

Thus, the Table of Sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals (in the form of a clock) to power the Yamiking.

 Point by point 

(1) The current text has:
Take, for example, the rainbow of colours reflected from a puddle of water when a thin film of oil rests on its surface. That phenomenon can be understood by thinking of light as waves, the length of which results in different colours.A very clear explanation of interference in thin films may be found in Sears, op. cit., p. 203ff. Other phenomena, like the working of light meters in cameras, can be explained by thinking in terms of particles of light (called photons) colliding with the detection screen inside the meter, the force of which is registered mechanically by a pointer or needle.

This is just plain wrong.  The length of waves does not """"result in different colours."""" The different wavelengths of light are perceived as different colors.  And the fact that the waves of light have different lengths does not explain the """"rainbow of colours"""" either. If the editor had bothered to read Sears he would have an understanding that would allow a correct explanation, not an exercise in the mystification of the novice reader.  

Second, the description of the light meter suggests a device like the carnival strength meter in which a contestant strikes a lever using a sledge hammer and the other end of the lever hits a ball that then moves vertically alongside a measuring stick of some kind. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Even if the crude analogy of an electron as a bullet that strikes electrons and knocks them out of their original planetary orbits be accepted, the electrons do not then physically strike the end of a needle that then moves along a dial face. T

If this article is to be radically rewritten, it should be done so with both a clear understanding of what the true facts are and also with an eye to presenting those facts in a way that will not cause very damaging preconceptions to form in the mind of the novice reader.

It is the differences in phases between the light waves reflected by the air/oil surface vs. the phases in the light waves reflected by the oil/water interface that effectively """"cancels"""" light of some wavelengths and permits light of some wavelengths to reach the eye of the observer from each different region of thickness of the oil film.  You criticized the original diagram that clearly shows how interference occurs as """"off-putting."""" But what have you put in its place?

It is the (mechanical analogy) pressure of the dislodged electrons that moves them off of the surface of the metal plate and through a wire to an electromagnet that attracts the spring-balanced needle which then moves in a way proportional to the induced amperage. Then they go through another wire back to the """"low pressure"""" region of the metal plate. Even in modern light meters, it is all a matter of electrons moving in electrical circuits, not electrons pushing on lever arms.

Please be careful to give the most useful citations. I have discovered one citation that is a circular reference to a Wikipedia article by way of an external """"encyclopedia."""" Also, the expression """"Trojan wave packet"""" will not mean anything to the average well informed reader, hence serving only to create an air of mystery and incomprehensibility.  I have already supplied a reference that distinguishes Trojan wave packets from other wave packets.  """,0

"""states, under the direct control of the larger federal sovereign.  

Also, if you look at the U.S. Constitution, both the Preamble and Article II repeatedly and consistently refer to """"the United States of America.""""

 They are referred to in both the Constitution and other documents as """"the United States"""" because before 1787, they were semi-independent.  This is where the Americans clouded the definitions of state and nation that the rest of the world successfully differentiates.  The Constitution was the coming together of states that minted their own currency, engaged in trade wars with each other, refused to extradite criminals just because they happened to cross a state line, etc. into a """"Union"""" hence how they became the """"United.""""  Up until the Civil War (especially in the South) is was thought that a state could easily withdraw if they didn't agree with the direction the Constitution was being torn into.  South Carolina attempted to get out in the 1830s, etc.  The Constitution of the United States of America is named as such simply because at first 13 states came together to agree to it.   This was at time when New England was thinking about leaving the Articles of Confederation and creating an entity from New York to Maine.  When sections of the American contintent west of the Appalachians were planning or trying to start their own little Republics (and some Kingdoms).  If the states hadn't come together and decided to lay down a new document for their confederation, and instead persisted after Annapolis to exist under the """"Articles of Confederation"""" from 1775, most likely the union would have fallen shortly after 1800 (if not sooner) and today we would see maps with other more localized confederations of the 50 states (which who knows if there would even be 50).  Your conceptualization of inter-state relations leading up to the 1787 constitution is limited.  A few delegates getting miffed would have changed the last three centuries of world history in ways we can hardly imagine. — 21:01, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 Republicans and religious Jews 

Excuse me.  In the """"Politics"""" section, the following sentence appears:

The Republicans generally receive more funding and support from business groups, religious Christians and Jews, and rural Americans, while the Democratic party receives more support from labor unions and minority ethnic groups.

In the history,  sliced out the phrase """"and Jews"""" and then  promptly reverted it.  Now, I'm a little confused.  Historically, when Jews are considered as a voting bloc, they tend to lean Democratic.  However, this analysis has always considered Jews as a single ethnic class and not separated out religious Jews from non-religious Jews.  Therefore, my question:

Does anyone have evidence that religious Jews tend to vote Republican (or Democratic)?

"The possibility intrigues me too. Its quite tight, the diagram is roughly to scale and there is about 330 yards clear between ships 120 yards long, but it could be done.

I think what actually happened to the other ships after the collision shows it would have been possible for the two columns to turn inwards very tight without colliding or crossing, but only by taking extreme measures (ie turning by reversing one screw). Victoria seems to have signalled she was doing a tight turn without engines (there were signaling devices to indicate if engines were reversed). Markham seems to have started off  with a textbook standard turn and then panicked too late, trying to turn faster.

 As for your """"obviously"""": Once again, you seem to be reading sentences out of context. Look at the context of this passage (italics added for emphasis):

""""There was division within the left as to the invasion of Afghanistan.  Nonetheless, an international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT Act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights.""""

""""Most prominent in this loose coalition were...""""

This is specifically about the protest movement at the time of the Afghanistan invasion (and was more exclusively so in earlier versions, because someone has now inserted """"and Iraq"""" in the next sentence). You say there was no anti-Afganistan-invasion-movement worth mentioning. Don't know where you were. I was in London at the time. 50,000 of us were in Trafalgar Square, that's usually considered a large enough protest to be worth mentioning. I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   | Talk 07:16, Jan 4,""",0

I agree with you that Mansfield probably wouldn't object to the label. He's willing to write a book about manliness, after all! ) But I don't think I'm being oversensitive. I've seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the Wikipedia to stigmatize various Bush administration officials, and it often involves linking together Leo Strauss, neoconservatism, and the War in Iraq. At one time, I thought the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles """"publicly identify with the belief in question"""" (at least I thought it did although I can't find the relevant passage now) and I assumed that's why the comment in the article said """"Mansfield has self identified as a Straussian."""" So when I downloaded the interview and it turned out that it did not substantiate the claim, I changed the language without changing the substance. There are so many conspiracy theories out there about Leo Strauss and the War in Iraq (see G-hits for the search terms [""""Leo Strauss"""" War Iraq]) that I tend to be vigilant with notable students of Leo Strauss, since the word """"Straussian"""" has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively.

"Solutions and suggestions ... 

 asked for a third-party opinion, so here goes:
 This long-running discussion makes me think of a few things in general:
 Michael is a newby, so the wiki policy of don't bite the newbies seems to be relevant, and it looks like for the most part,  is sticking to that, apart from personal comments about Michael's English. I can relate to the fact that it is sometimes hard to figure out what someone's point is, and that may be what Kwami was trying to say about Michael, but I think it's out of line to say that someone's English is non-native, or that someone's knowledge of Arabic is similarly less than desirable. So my point on this one is this: stick to the point and leave personal comments out.
 Sometimes, discussions about articles and edits get pretty heated, even without personal comments. If you can't handle it, take a wikibreak. This is what I do, and it works for me.
 Divide up the topics for discussion - it makes it much easier for people to comment without having to read lots and lots of stuff they aren't interested in. For example, if I want to comment about /el/ and /ba'al/, where in that long discussion would I want to put my comment?
 I think one of the best things that can be done for this article is to divide it up. Put the meat of the Wadi al-Hol in an article by itself, and the Proto-Sinaitic script information in its own page. What remains of the Middle Bronze Age alphabets is a general summary of why these two are thought to be related, plus thumbnail sketches of the content of those two articles, with appropriate Main Article type links. I think this will focus the discussion. For example, if Colliss has written about one but not the other, all refutation and support of Colliss's arguments will be guided to the right discussion pages.
 This topic is one of many that has scholars screaming at each other. There are ways of summarizing the opposing arguments that allow casual readers to understand the controversy without getting information overload.
 In relation to both of these scripts, the article suffers from a dearth of citations, appropriate or otherwise. The various assertions are interesting and serve as a stepping-off point for finding the actual sources, so I would oppose the deletion of every single unsupported citation. After all, it was only a few years ago that Wikipedians started to insist on citations - before then, there was a whole lot of original research, some of which still persists without proper citations.
 I for one would like to know how many examples of these inscriptions have been found. From the current state of this article, it seems like there is only one of proto-Sinaitic (which was found in two locations, which can't be right) and that there are only two Wadi al-Hol inscriptions, which we can see in the illustration provided. There is also a citable reference in some National Geographic website about Semitic anti-snake inscriptions in part of Unas's tomb in Giza. Maybe that should have its own page, too, with an appropriate link.
 I don't buy this business about Arabic being irrelevant. It reminds me too much of how European researchers dismissed all Arabic scholarship about the Arabic language itself. However, any references to Arabic in an article on a topic from the Middle Bronze Age have to keep in mind the huge time difference. For example, the hamza was a much later development, so it sheds about as much light on Wadi al-Hol as the development of the letters J, V and W.
 I don't accept the table at all - the article is about an intermediate step that is not represented in the table. The table represents conjecture about connections between two known endpoints, Hieroglyphic and the Semitic alphabet (for lack of a better term). Besides, if the hypothesis is that the proto-Sinaitic script evolved from hieratic writing, then why is that script not represented in the table?
 I don't accept the business of naming these letters. Unless there is evidence to show that these symbols even had names at the time they were used, the names are anachronistic. If the names were in fact attested at a different time in a different script, the person promoting the use of the names has a big burden. In terms of Wikipedia, all we have to do is say that a particular citable scholar has made the connection, and if the connection is disputed, we can point to a citation that says that too. It is our own editorial discretion that says how we portray that dispute, for example,
 A says X, but others disagree, for example, B.
 It is not clear whether X is true, as claimed by A, or whether Y is true, as claimed by B.
 Scholars disagree on whether X is tr",0
"""

Find any other equivalent. You guys have changed the entire subject. The fact of the matter is that you can not call ethnic groups prior to 1919 as Azerbaijani; there was no such defined identity. Why are there articles on the Dutchy? The Dutchy were more defined as a group than were the Turkic peoples living in those lands… why not plain German? And again, Parishan is using Russian and Soviet propaganda material, which maintained such a position, including for the Turks living in Armenia, to stop Turkey's expansionism… they had Turks in Nakhichevan and those in Armenia rather to adhere to an Azerbaijani identity than Turkish. But prior to the Soviet rules, those people were not identifying themselves, neither were they identified as such. I am wondering how much more can Parishan provide other than Soviet-Russian historiography which was known to be tainted when covering ethnic groups and ethno genesis, turning ethnic groups into groups that all originated from the identities forming the Union, some sort of Self-Sufficient system. This process already started during the end of the Russian Empire, Roy writes: In Azerbaijan for a brief period (the governorate of Vorontsov in the 1850s, and that of Goltsyn from 1896 to 1905), the Russians encouraged the development of an Azeri identity in order to weaken links with Iran and Turkey (The New Central Asia The Creation of Nations by Olivier Roy I.B.Tauris, (2000) p.56)

During the process, many different groups were pushed into being identified as ethnically Azerbaijani, including Kurds, who haven't until recently when groups wanted their independence requested their identity to be changed: In 1988 some 10,000 Kurds in Azerbaijan returned their Azeri identity papers to Moscow with the explicit request that their identity be changed from Azeri to Kurd. (A Modern History of the Kurds by David McDowall, I.B.Tauris (2004), p.493)

And to use Parishan’s opening, it is funny how Parishan is requesting sources for those quotes, Ulvi were you not a participant on the arbitration enforcement? How many sources were used? Parishan has probably missed references like this: In 1897 'Tatars'-which officially included most Muslim groups... (Socialism in Georgian Colors: The European Road to Social Democracy, 1883-1917, Harvard University Press (2005) p. 19)

Here, another quote missed by Parishan: In Contrast with the Armenians, the Azerbaijani national identity is very recent. In fact, the very name """"Azerbaijani"""" was not widely used until the 1930s; before that, Azerbaijani intellectuals were unsure whether they should call themselves Caucasian Turks, Muslims, Tatars or something else.  (S.Kaufmann, Modern hatred, Cornell University Press, 2001. See page 56.) 

Do I need to provide what was provided and include also newer ones? I like Eupator’s request RFC about this article, and a it’s a good idea of requesting the same for several other articles. Ulvi, your English language justification makes no sense; you could have changed for Turkic people instead of making an inaccurate move. -   """,0

 The """"Ethiopian birr model"""" 

You suggested to use this model in some cases. In my opinion, it is okay to include a territory in the current part succession box that has some autonomous rights (especially the right to have its own currency, like pre-2006 Montenegro or present-day Kosovo). Therefore, in the case of Ethiopian birr, it makes sense to speak about currency of Eritrea between 1952-1960 and between 1993-1997. between 1960-1993, only Ethiopian administration existed, Eritrea had neither sovereignty nor any sort of autonomous rights. (Saying in 1978 that the currency of Eritrea is the birr is like saying in 2006 that the currency of East Germany is the euro.) The same case of Austria between 1938-1945. Even Ukraine and Belarus represents the same situation during their Soviet Union """"membership"""", however, both countries had more or less autonomy and were members of the UN since 1945. 

I have the fear that the innumerable border modifications in Europe during the XXth century will make huge and complicated succession boxes. For example, after WWII, Slovakia got back not only its Southern territories (Which the 1st Vienna Award awarded to Hungary in 1938), but three villages near to Pozsony / Bratislava (Horvátjárfalu / Jarovce, Oroszvár / Rusovce, Dunacsúny / Cunovo) were awarded to Slovakia (Treaty of Paris) due to strategic considerations. One could say that who cares with three villages, but this territory was part of Hungary between the two world wars - and it is not much smaller than Muraköz (Medimurje)...

So I don't think each territorial change must be mentioned in the succession box. Only mention if the currency of a new country / state / autonomous province etc. (so a state-like subject that has the right to circulate its own currency) appears without precedessor (like Eritrean nakfa after split from Ethiopia in 1993, but unlike Ethiopian birr after split of Eritrea) or disappears without successor (like East German mark after the reunificaton of Germany in 1990, but unlike West-German mark after the reunification).

For example, German mark or deutschmark was the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany between 1948-2001. It would express that East Germany was simply integrated into West-Germany (contrary to the widely used """"reunification"""" term), at least from the point of view of the circulating currency. It would also express that Germany is not the successor state of West Germany but the same country with an enlarged territory. 

In the case of the pengő, I would simply say that it was the currency of Hungary between 1 Jan 1927 and 31 Jul 1946. Northern Transylvania, Southern Slovakia and Bácska was totally incorporated into the Hungarian administration. Subcarpathia enjoyed some autonomy, but it was very little and cannot be compared to the rights of then-Yugoslav federal states, present day US states or German federal states.

Naturally, this is only my opinion, I would like to know your thoughts.  """,0

 Fighting Campaign Battles   TAB 
During the campaign the player has the option of forming armies to defend their borders, wage war and destroy rebel armies that appear occasionaly. 

This is already covered under the second paragraph of the Gameplay section, specifically: """"The campaign allows the player to assume control of a faction of the time period, and build a civilization, economy and military in order to conquer other factions. Gameplay consists of controlling the faction's military, economic, and social systems via a large campaign map. During the player's turn, armies, fleets, and agents can be moved on the map. When an army engages another army, the player can choose to fight the battle personally, in the battle mode, or automatically calculate the outcome.""""

Armies are formed from 'Units' normally consisted of 20-30 men for artillery, 30-40 men for cavalry and 60-70 men for infantry or archers. In adition to this a general can also recruit mercenaries for a price if need be. An army can consist of up to twenty units, or as little as one, and will move according to the units it contains. This means that an army consisting entirely of cavalry can cover a lot of ground in one turn, but would be able to cover a much shorter distance were the army to have any artillery or infantry units. 

I feel that this falls under http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information specifically section 4, Instruction Manuals. The specific number of people in a unit isn't significant except in the context of the game, nor are unit speed, the ability to recruit mercenaries and army size limits (since they are artificial limits established by the game designers.)

A general can be selected from amongst your family to lead the army, and he will benefit or hinder the army based on his personal traits, a General who starts fighting when he is young is more likely to develop a keen skill for combat that one who has spent most of his life governing a city. The risk is that should the army be beaten then the General may die, and even during a battle that is going in your favour your general can still get cut off, surrounded by the enemy or hit by a stray arrow. Losing a general can bring an end to a generation if he were the only son without an heir, which can affect your whole family tree for generations. An army without a general is lead by a captain, who will fight alongside whichever unit you select as the first unit in your army. A captain who performs well in battle may be promoted to General, and be adopted into your family. These generals are generally better suited to combat rather than Govenment roles.

Generals are already covered under Agents and Characters: """"In addition to their agents, each faction is ruled by a family, the male members of which act as generals in battle. Each general has a number of attributes which determine how well he governs a settlement and how well he leads an army in battle. A general's actions can affect his attributes- for example, a general who routinely kills prisoners of war may see his """"dread"""" increase, making him frightening to foes; a general who prefers to release prisoners may instead increase his """"chivalry"""", which makes his own troops braver.""""

When two armies meet they can engage in combat, which can be either automatically resolved by the computer or fought by the the player.

Already covered at the end of the second paragraph of Gameplay: """"When an army engages another army, the player can choose to fight the battle personally, in the battle mode, or automatically calculate the outcome.""""

''Armies can meet in several ways: two armies meet on an area of open ground face to face and resolve their differences, an army can wait in a wooded area and surprise a passing enemy army, an army can lay seige to a town or castle and fight the garrison for control. Training and forming a working army is an expensive and lengthly process, and traveling to fight the enemy can take even longer, so the aim of every Battle during the campaign is to kill or capture as many of the enemy as possible, while minimizing the loss to your own army, thus allowing you to carry on fighting for longer with the same army. This means knowing exactly when and where to strike",0

Hi, 
you deleted 飞天号航天服 & 飞天

I think these qualify under  since they are the original language names for the article in question (Feitian space suit), so are indeed likely search terms. If someone read an article and copypasted or typed in the original name, shouldn't they be able to reach the correct article? 70.51.8.75

70.51.8.75  
Hi there, this is a difficult one & I can see both sides of the coin. I've tried to see if there is a consensus by looking through Category:Redirects from alternative languages but I'm still not sure. I have always read the """"redirect from another language as being more related to things such as Kyiv (topical one that one - read the talk page! - but I digress), or Das Wohltemperirte Clavier rather than a literal transalation of every article's name in to other languages, particulary those with non-Latin character sets.  This is why I feel that the two (Mandarin?) words/phrases you have mentioned equally fall in to the territory of unlikely/implausible phrases for a person to type on the English language Wikipedia. But the bottom line is that I am one admin & one opinion (which is a valid opinion but equally is far from unchallengable). The redirects were speedily deleted so as there was no deletion discussion there is no community consensus for their deletion which means that you are free to recreate. If they are renominated for deletion I will recuse myself from the process and we'll see what others think. Sound OK to you? Kind regards,  talk 
Well, there's the essay Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Redirects from foreign languages . The article's name is a phonetic and literal translation of the actual name. (ie. It's a chinese spacesuit, the actual name is in chinese, not English).  From the bit about non-Latin characters, doesn't that indicate bias, since English is used in Hong Kong as an official language, where Chinese characters are prevalent, or India, where non-Latin script is common and English is widely used. But we already use a lot of implausible names that people would type",0

"Nature of the holdings in Mimms and Miller/“Police” vs. “peace officer” 

In carefully reviewing these cases, I cannot find support for the language I used several years ago, so I’ve revised it to strictly reflect what the Court actually said. Although the Court did not expressly require that a peace officer cite particularized concern for his safety, they did not expressly say that it was unnecessary, either.

The clarification of “federal law” is also important, because the Supreme Court, empowered under Article III of the US Constitution, cannot really grant “authority” to a peace officer; rather, they are limited to interpretation of laws and review for conformance with the Constitution, as they make quite clear in the citation from Mimms.

I’ve added a tag to the assertion that state law may not allow drivers or passengers to be ordered to exit the vehicle; though this assertion may be correct, it’s pretty sweeping, and needs support. It may be particularly significant in light of the Death of Sandra Bland. Many pundits have insisted that Ms. Bland’s failure to exit her car when so ordered provided cause for arrest, usually citing Mimms and Miller, and perhaps Texas Transportation Code §542.501. The Supreme Court holdings were of course limited to the Fourth Amendment, and did not (and could not) consider whether refusal to exit a vehicle after being so ordered violated state law; unless the Commerce Clause of Article I is somehow involved (and this seems unlikely), that would be a matter for state legislators to regulate, and state courts to interpret. Some states well may have done so; however, I have been unable to find anything close to dispositive, and have not seen anyone else do so. I am not going to make a project of running this down, but if someone else can provide this information, it would seem a great addition. Hopefully, any such reference would cite real decisional law that is unambiguous to the average reader, rather than a mere assertion by a third party (if the third party cannot cite authority, that party’s assertion is suspect).   

 “Police” vs. “peace officer” 
I do not understand the suggestion that “peace officer” or “law enforcement officer” is strictly the proper term needs support; I think the linked WP article makes it quite clear that either of these terms—which refer to a superset of “police officer”—are the strictly correct usage. I used “police” simply because in some other articles, other editors—usually IP—kept changing it to “police officer,” and the bickering seemed a poor use of time. And I reasoned that if the Supreme Court can use “police”—correctly or otherwise—we cannot be faulted for doing so here. Whoever added that tag did not give a reason; absent some good reason to keep it (or perhaps a suggested rewording of the note), I’m inclined to remove the tag.",0

Evidence
Admin  was admonished in the  WebEx and Min_Zhu arbcom case """"not to use his administrative tools or give warnings in content disputes in which he is involved.""""

FM then removed evidence that showed he was acting inappropriately.  He also made a previous block on 20 July 2006, incorrectly citing the arbcom decision of 'associated articles', while first providing no evidence, then false evidence (diff he provided was not to Ken Ham), to justify his accusation and inappropriate block.  (Note that KillerChihuahua removed evidence from that page, claiming that it was posted by a banned user, while no one in that decision was banned from Wikipedia; therefore, the removal was inappropriate.)  

 The reason and contest of the block is obviously that the blocking admin acted inappropriately by placing a block against someone on the 'other side' of a content dispute (and removing evidence by deleting a post that was not his own) in the first place.

"Deletion of AV News page 

Just curious why the AV News page is being deleted while its primary competitor Antelope Valley Press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.

Granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as AV Press and even more so than AV Town Crier, whose page is also allowed to be here I note.

Here is the content:

The AV News began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Lancaster, California USA. It was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in 2006. In 2008, the AV News added a website and in March 2010, much like the Seatte Post-Intelligencer, the AV News transitioned to a web-only publication. The AV News covers the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County - mainly the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including Acton, Agua Dulce, Edwards AFB, Lake Los Angeles, Mojave, Quartz Hill, Rosamond and Santa Clarita. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance. It is currently the official news publication of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team in Lancaster.

History

The AV News was founded by Fran Paolinelli in 2006. She continues to work at the publication today. It began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at www.avnewsday.com

The paper, conservative leaning, holds strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.

Competitors in its market are the Daily News, Antelope Valley Press and the Los Angeles Times.

External links
AV News Official Website

The format is the same as the AV Press. There is less historical info that the AV Press because we have only been going for six years and they've been up for decades. But still, we are getting e-mails from people who use Wiki to find out about the Lancaster/Palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.

I also point out that the City of Lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.

removed """"which had been reclaimed from Japan in 1945"""". this is not an article on Japan. space is limited. why does this belong in the lead? This is in the history section.
""""the KMT set up what it called a provisional capital in Taipei"""" > """"the KMT declared Taipei the provisional capital"""". the latter is much shorter. the POV of regarding Taipei a provisional capital is alleviated by using the word """"declare"""". The KMT declared. That is not disputed, even not by the PRC.

The former is misleading and wrong.
Removed """"While the tense standoff of the Cold War era has largely subsided"""". Text formerly here about battles is gone. this clause is no longer necessary
Removed """"on both sides of the Taiwan Strait"""". Redundant. It is contentious everywhere (in the realm of international relations etc). and this is too obvious since these are the two sides in contention.
Removed """"and one of the original five Security Council members"""". removed in the interests of brevity. keep this in the foreign relations section. a mention of the UN membership is enough.
""""Most major countries now recognize the PRC as having succeeded the ROC as the representative of China"""" > """"Most countries switched their recognition from the ROC to the PRC in the 1970s"""" The former is wrong. These countries have established formal relations of the PRC, but merely """"acknowledged"""" the PRC's claims over Taiwan.

Can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty.  I'm certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as """"problematic"""".  Five weeks ago I was getting involved in wikipedia and I was feeling enthusiastic, so I posted something to some user groups (reaching 10,000+ members), encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia.  I thought, at the time, that long-time wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people, and that wikipedians would be happy that I encouraged others to participate.  I was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute.  The groups I posted to were user groups, not employee groups.  But yes, I guess that some employees belong to these groups as well.  And my comment about Hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal POV is that he found a good way for someone with COI to contribute. 

I feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. It is un-welcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors.  I see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world, trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding.  I think that even if I only have time to make a small number of contributions, I feel I am helping, and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia.  So seeing your criticism that I am not making enough edits to non-commercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.
I hate feeling that I have to defend my reputation here, and I don't agree with you that editing non-commercial pages should improve anyone's appearance of trustworthiness.  However, your claim that I am only editing the wikipedia entries of """"these commercial products"""" is also just incorrect.  I don't know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others, but if there is, you would see that I've been making edits to many non-commercial pages, including CRISP-DM, Data mining, the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Predictive analytics, Statistics, Customer retention, Predictive Model Markup Language, Anomaly detection, SEMMA, Machine learning, Jacques Cousteau, SIGKDD, Decision tree learning.  Sometimes I'm making simple formatting edits, and sometimes I'm spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the CRISP-DM page.  Yes, my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining, because that is where I have the greatest interest and knowledge.  Similarly, when I guest lecture at local universities, I lecture to these types of classes, not due to any collusion, but because that's what I know.

Thanks for listening to my mini-rant.  I know I'm taking this more personally than you probably meant it.  But it bothers me when someone questions that I am not working hard enough or they question my ethics, and that's what your comments feel like.  All I'm asking is that long-established wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging, and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions (however small).  New people grow and adjust - but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community.  Please be patient and encouraging to new people.

I'm going to leave this discussion now.  If needed, I will return to it after the holiday season.  But I hope there is no need to.    """,0

And thank YOU for the passive-aggression Larry, and for the veiled threat to """"block"""" those who expose your laziness as such.  Is your confidence in your position really that frail?

You and your supporters introduced legal sources to this debate as authority for your statement that it's torture.  Fine, but if you're going to do that, you open the door to legal criticism of your incorrect use of the sources.  I just gave you several specific reasons why your methodology was flawed and you're trying to side-step the points I raised.  Fair enough...let readers decide.

I've read several of your other posts on here and I must say that your epistemological position seems to me incoherent: on the one hand you tell those who disagree with you that they must cite reliable sources for the proposition that such-and-such is not x, when the fact is that the burden of proof is on YOU Larry, and those who want to be able to make the statement that """"waterboarding is torture.""""  This is a cheap debater's trick and it inhibits the productivity of producing genuine factual knowledge for the consumers of Wikipedia.  The burden of proof is never on the person seeking to prove a negative, but on the person seeking to prove that a proposition is valid.  You cannot seek refuge in """"consensus,"""" when there clearly is NO demonstrable consensus on the issue  which is part of why this issue is so controversial (and by the way, what comprises consensus anyway? 51% agree? 75%? 95%?...the standard is squishy to begin with, but then again, I'm not the one appealing to consensus as authoritative here).

You're also being weasely when you suggest that all you want to be able to do is to say that """"x is x,"""" when what you really want to be able to say is that """"y is x.""""  Comprende?  The fact that something is debatable and can be qualified (or rather buried in the part of the article few will ever read) further down does not justify an editorial decision to report that """"y is x,"""" because some other dilettante said so.  By now, it's pretty transparent that your intent is to use the lead to advance your political bias on this issue.  You know that most readers will never get beyond the first paragraph which is why you're willing to cite """"non-consensus"""" views where nobody will ever see them.  How noble of you!

And frankly, to equate that authoritativeness of the U.S. Supreme Court or The Hague or any other who has professional responsibilities for which they have consequential accountability with the authoritativeness of an opinionated journalist or law professor blogger (who, incidentally, hasn't necessarily ever had to pass the Bar) seems childish and dangerous.

"""==King George County, VA==

There seems to be some a contridiction of the status of King George County. The King George County page indicates that King George County is NOT a part of the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Yet, according to the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area page, it is.

This also brings to light a local controversey regarding King George County and whether or not it is part of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Historically, King George County has been included as part of the Northern Neck. The Northern Neck Tourism Council website lists locations in King George County amongst its historical sites and museums, and the King George County Homepage labels the county as the """"Gateway to the Historic Northern Neck"""". I was educated in Northumberland County, Virginia, and this is what we were taught during our segment on local history for 11th grade US History, that there are FIVE counties in the Northern Neck, including King George County.

However, until 11th grade, I had always grown up under the assumption that the Northern Neck consisted of only four counties: Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Richmond counties. Locals think of the Northern Neck more as a community with similar  values and interests, rather than a geographical area. King George county is considered to be """"suburban"""", part of the Washington DC urban sprawl and therefore doesn't share the same community interests as the rest of the Northern Neck.

This article from the Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star highlights both sides of the King George debate.

The inclusion of King George County as part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area stems from three facts: King George's proximity to Fredericksburg, its inclusion in the Washington DC media market, and the presence of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren. However, the historical connections between King George County and the Northern Neck shouldn't be dismissed. It wouldn't be inappropriate to consider King George County as part of both, as Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area seems to be a statistical category, while the Northern Neck is a historical/geographical region.

I have also added this discussion to the pages on both the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and the King George County pages. If there is no further discussion or objection, I will edit the Northern Neck page to include mention of the local debate on the status of King George County.  """,0

"Agreed. The term ‘blastocyst’ appears to be based on a false distinction that has been drawn between ‘the embryo proper’ and the embryo at an earlier stage of development, sometimes the term ‘pre-embryo’ is used in this context. However the precise stage at which an embryo can be classified as a ‘blastocyst’ or a 'pre-embryo' seems to involve a somewhat subjective judgement. The article currently says:
      
A blastocyst is a stage of development of an embryo when it is around five days old and made up of about 100 cells.

Because of their highly subjective nature, terms such as bastocyst and pre-embryo are problematic and may be criticised for trying to dehumanize the human embryo.",0

"Request to participate in University of Washington survey on tool to quickly understand Wikipedians’ reputations 

Hello. I'm part of a research group at the University of Washington. In April, we met with Wikipedians to learn what they would like to know about other editors’ history and activities (within Wikipedia) when interacting with them on talk pages. The goal was to gather feedback to help design a tool that could quickly communicate useful information about other Wikipedians. We have now created a few images that we feel represent some of what our participants thought was important. We would appreciate it if you took a few minutes of your time to complete an online survey that investigates whether or not these images would be useful to you.  Your quick contribution would be very valuable to our research group and ultimately to Wikipedia. (When finished, the code for this application will be given over to the Wikipedia community to use and/or adjust as they see fit.)

We are particularly interested in feedback from new editors! We want to make sure this tool meets your needs.  

Willing to spend a few minutes taking our survey? Click this link. 

Please feel free to share the link with other Wikipedians. The more feedback, the better!

"All the Earth mumbo-jumbo we talked about 

I've done an Excel database to solve the problem of the perimeter of an ellipse, and also a Word document explaining how to find the distance between two coordinates on Earth. You can download it at . I am sure there are other more sophisticated ways to look for a solution, but I've done it according to my maths level. I'm used to cartesian coordinates, and I know very few things about differential calculus.

This solution I found does have an accuracy of millimetres. Ground elevation isn't mentioned, I believe that is elementary. Also, I want to acknowledge that, after all, I don't believe that the Earth is perfectly spheroidal, and I think you think that also ). There probably is a more accurate Earth equation within some NASA department, describing surface irregularities, etc. I once heard that within its spheroidal shape, the Earth has a pear-shaped tendency (it is thinner at the top and fatter at the bottom).

Could another admin have a serious word in the ear of StuRat (talk • contribs). He is a consistently disruptive editor who regularly accuses admins of abuse and cabalism. This evening alone he has been:

Accusing an admin of """"an abuse of Admin authority"""" in protecting a page being targeted by a persistent banned user (whom, incidently, StuRat was an erstwhile colleague of and still occasionally adds content on his behalf). 

Goading an editor who indicated they are leaving the project (after a run in with a new editor with a suspiciously detailed knowledge of the project) 

Replacing the goading comment after three independent editors expressed disaproval (the aforementioned new user gets in on the act too). 

I have already warned him, but he ignored me, and I am a bit too close to take any action without stoking the claims of abuse. Thanks. Rockpocket 

1) Note that RP did not request a block, is it normal to take a request to talk with an editor and ignore that and issue a block instead ?  

2) I do believe that it is inappropriate for an Admin involved in an edit war on a page to protect that page when it has the version they support, and believe the talk page for that page, in this case Wikipedia_talk:Reference_desk/guidelines, was the appropriate place to bring up that concern.  

3) As I stated on RP's talk page, I was not """"goading"""" an editor who said they were leaving Wikipedia, but merely stated that I believed they would be back, and why I thought so.  I did object to the removal of that statement from User:Clio the Muse's talk page, by anyone other than Clio.  However, once Clio removed the statement herself, I respected that, and had already told RP that I would respect that.  Somebody else then put it back in (possibly a banned user) and I suspect that RP mistakenly thought it was me putting it back in, due to this edit comment: . 

Does this have anything to do with User:Light current? —Kyриx

Eric, I have discussed the matter with Clio privately, and I don't really think my actions today could be described as coddling. Rockpocket  

Hm, the user has a history of incivility and a talk page full of warnings. Looking through his recent edit history reveals many incivil remarks or attacks [101] [102], as well as complaints of abuse [103] and vague threats [104].

"Armigerous Clans / Non-armigerous clans. 

As I understand it there is no such thing as an 'armigerous clan'. Lord Lyon's website makes this point clear -

'There is a widespread misconception that a family or a clan can have a family or clan Coat of Arms. Many heraldic and clan web sites and other media suggest that a person has the right to use the family or clan Arms. This is completely incorrect.'http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/216.181.html accessed 8 June 2014

So much of this page should be altered to remove this idea. 

I note in particular that the Clan Gunn has never had a Chief recognised by Lord Lyon so to state as this page does that it is an armigerous clan is totally incorrect.",0

Since this seems to have blown up spectacularly in my face, I might as well explain my edit. /

I came across this BLP, which hadn't been edited since last year, and noticed that the paragraph about her signing that creationism petition seemed a disjointed and tangential - her signing the petition is unquestionably notable, but it seemed jarring to go straight from discussion of her research to """"In February 2006, the New York Times reported... The petition, a two-sentence statement,"""" without stating why she signed the petition or anything. We have an essay about these sorts of articles and the problems with them - WP:COATRACK. I checked out her personal webpage, noticed she was quite open about her religion, googled """"Rosalind Picard christian"""" and found an Atlantic Monthly article that discussed at length why she was a creationist. So I added a sentence about that, making the article flow more smoothly into the signing of the petition. I also removed the second sentence explaining the petition, as I thought it was straying too off-topic.

I discussed this with Raul and can now see the merits of leaving that last sentence in - I think the article as it now stands is acceptable. What's greatly troubling to me is that instead of discussing this and working out a compromise, certain folks refused my invitation to discuss it and instantly jumped on me and started canvassing for a revert war when a few minutes of discussion would have cheerfully resolved the situation instead. (I'm personally as agnostic and anti-creationist as it gets... the only god I'm working in the name of here is WP:BLP.) This really isn't the way Wikipedia should work - assuming everyone is a POV pusher by default is not how we do things around here. ✽ """,0

Another thing Noobuntu is infamous for is crippling SU (substitute user), sudo on a server is unwieldy and selling sudo on security is basically snake oil, Ubuntu sets you up with root-like permissions anyway, and doesn't make any attempt to tech you how to limit other users access to the system appropriately.

 Italian 

Hey Sajoch, if you can discuss things relaxed for a bit, I do have a question I'd like to ask a Ladin from Bolzano.  I always hear about the Italians coming and taking over.  But, can you explain to me who exactly are """"the Italians""""?  As far as I know, Italian in the modern sense is simply a citizen of the Italian Republic.  Going back a few hundred years ago, I suppose people might say they are a people """"of Italy"""", or the Italic peninsula.  But, I'd say that even to this day, many people in Italy don't refer to themselves as Italian first.  Aren't the people of Sicily, Sicilians?  The people of Napoli, Napolitani?  As far as I can tell, the """"Ladin"""" are the people of the region we happen to call Trentino-Alto Adige, and also the Romansch speakers in Switzerland are speaking essentially the same (or a VERY similar) language.  It would make sense that this pocket of Europe has its own particular language, and a language which is old-Latin based.  So, when you say you are Ladin, and not Italian... to me that is no different from someone saying they are Sicilian, and not Italian.  Then that brings me back to my original question: who is actually Italian?  Isn't the Italian language the Tuscan language actually?  So are Italians actually the people from Tuscany?  I know that Trentino is said to be majority Italian, but the people there speak Italian in modern times because it is the national language.  They still speak their original dialects like Nones, Solardo, etc.. which are actually Ladin languages.  You know that, right?  So are the people in Trentino Ladin people, or have they transformed into Italians because the Italian Republic has a National Language?  I'm just throwing these questions out there, as someone interested in my own history.  I mentioned this once to noclador, """"who are the Italians?"""" and all the discussion got me was him giving me the link to the Wikipedia page on Italians.  My guess is that some of the questions I was asking blurred the lines of a politics he would rather dream is black and white.

Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe
Hey, a few years ago I was reading a really old Reader's Digest and I swear I actually read an article written first person from an organ's point of view.  (I don't remember which.)

...and the guy's name was Joe.

This was before I read the book, so I just thought it was a really odd coincidence at the time...I can't seem to find the article anymore, though.  Does anyone else have any info on this?  Was Joe changed to Jack to avoid legal troubles with the original """"Joe's XXXXXX"""" author?

 The author of the book was talking about real stories from Reader's Digest, so you probably did read the same ones he refered to. """"Joe"""" is changed to """"Jack"""" in the movie because Reader's Digest wasn't willing to allow them to mention it in the film.  LGagnon

I have a copy of John Pekkanen's article """"I am John's Brain Tumour"""", from Reader's Digest (South Africa) 1990-12, volume 137, number 824. Chapter 7 of my copy of Palahniuk's Fight club has """"I am Jane's Uterus. I am Joe's Prostate. [...] I am totally Joe's Gallbladder"""", ISBN 0-099-28333-6, Vintage (1997) UK Random House. The English RD sites I searched came up empty. The earliet """"Joe""""s I found were two 1974 videos  from """"Pyramid Films"""". I found that """"Pyramid Media"""" credits it to RD . Does anyone have a source of an actual Reader's Digest article with """"Joe""""? - , 2004-04-15t22:37z

 It is mentioned on the commentary for the DVD that Reader's Digest told them not to use """"Joe"""". Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that """"Joe"""" should be used more often in the article than """"Jack"""" (though """"the narrator"""" fits the character's """"name"""" more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with details on the movie where applicable. Otherwise, what we would be doing would be the equivelent of someone making the Lord of the Rings article more about the Peter Jackson movie than JRR Tolkien's work.  LGagnon

Tyler section
We should merge the Tyler Durden section into the characters section. There isn't a need for 2 separate sections on him. As it is it looks redundant and a bit sloppy. Any details that don't fit that section can go into a different one.  LGagnon

Backstory of the novel
I just recently updated the article on Chuck Palahniuk with info on how Fight Club came to be. This is in the first paragraph of the Biography section. I was wondering if anyone thought we should include that info in this article, since it gives the backstory of how it was written.   Talk]] 12:00, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Right, thanks Richard. I guess my question is more one of whether it's """"okay"""" to revert edits that are otherwise non-controversial just because they're made by a suspected sock? The recent spates of edits to Hull really do seem to be in good faith and aren't clear-cut vandalism; it's more peacockism and too much detail, along with the frustration of little things like having to correct source formatting for consistency and the poor/inconsistent use of edit summaries, after entreaties on talk pages receive no response.

I copy this from comfort women pages. It contains many references.

Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.

From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006
 
'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'

The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, """"In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words """"comfort women"""" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. 

In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as """"yanggongju"""" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.

In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual """"yanggalbo"""" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. 

Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.)

References also arise in Yi, Imha. 2004a. The Korean War and Gende (Hankuk Chonjaengkwa Jaendo). Seoul: Sohaemunjip.

Have you seen The Women Outside: Korean Women and the U.S. Military. Directors J.T. Takagi and Hye Jung Park. 1995. 60 minutes. VHS?

Many of Korean women were also forced, tricked, financial compromised or even kidnapped into sexual slavery for American troops in South Korea. As example, the documentary features Yang Hyang Kim, who """"applied for a job in what she thought was a coffee house, only to be sold to a brothel outside Camp Stanley"""".

Same as Japanese Imperialists before them. They both documents how the Korean and American governments were involved, how Korean officials portrayed the women as “personal ambassadors” fulling their patriotic duty to nation by sexually servicing soldiers. The rape and murder of women by the pimps and the soldiers.

It says. """"Drawing upon interviews and testimonies, emphasize that many of the women who """"serve"""" the US military as so-called voluntary sex workers were in fact recruited in the same brutal ways as were their earlier counterparts in Japan's 'comfort system', that is, through coercion, trickery, and even force - because both Korean and American governmental interests have viewed men's access to female bodies for R & R as so crucial to military morale.""""

 Made in the USA? http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

"Hi Looie496.

Thank you for advising me of this. Appreciated. I really do love Wikipedia but I must insist that I'm allowed to love it on my own terms because I can do no other (or go without, which I candidly admit is the fate of most of my love affairs oh dear ...).

As I think I must surely have made clear I really do have nothing further to add to the comments about 'Buddhist sex abuse cases' I have already made. I do hope the page is restored.

Currently I'm fleshing out the biographies of  Leveller women. I've already supplied a stub for Katherine Chidley and I'm presently working on one for User:Rinpoche/Mary Overton wife of Richard Overton. It will take a few days before it's ready yet.

Mary Overton was subjected to appalling abuse at one point in her life. She was nursing her new born baby when baillifs came to escort her to Millwall prison in London,an absolutely dreadful place. She refused so the bailiffs then called for some carters to take her away. They too refused out of common humanity. The bailffs then physically dragged her clutching her baby through the mire and dirt of the London streets while people spat abuse. 

Well I don't know but I think it quite possible that some of them went as far as telling her to 'go fuck yourself' which is absolutely frightful of course. 

The baby died some six months later.

Regarding the BSAC debacle what I've done with my Katherine Chidley stub is that on the talk page I've added at the top a section for contributors in which I myself, as a contributing editor, expressly ask people to contact me on my talk page if they have any issues with it; the lack of a definition for the term 'controversialist' for example which I can see might be a real no brainer for users of a certain disposition.

"""proposal by Coulliard 

I'm going on the soapbox for awhile, an uncomfortable position in a baseball game (sliding runners tend to knock it out from under you).  I want to explain my position without us getting personal.  If you take offense, apologies in advance.  And apologies for being so wordy.  Genetic defect.

I am a baseball researcher by hobby (computer programmer by trade), and I take everything about baseball's history seriously, especially the Negro Leagues, which have become my area of expertise.  Segregation in Baseball remains the absolute worst scar on its face.

In my opinion (emphasis on it being my opinion), Josh Gibson, Pete Hill, Satchel Paige, Bullet Rogan, Oscar Charleston, Andy Cooper, José Méndez, Cristobal Torrienté, and many others men would have easily been Hall of Famers long, long ago had it not been for segregation.  It's my belief that given current evidence Gibson wouldn't have hit much more than 500 or so home runs playing a full schedule, given the HR rates of the 30s and 40s (not nearly as high as today), given his truncated career (he died after his 17th season), and given the position he played (catchers just don't play full schedules because of the extreme wear and tear; on the other hand, he might have been converted into an outfielder or first baseman in an integrated Majors, and 600+ would have been a possibility.

Babe Ruth hit 714 Major League HRs; had he had to face Bullet Rogan, Andy Cooper, Satchel Paige, and other pitchers of color, his totals might have tailed down toward 650 or so, and that in a 22-year career compared to Gibson's 17.

What we know is that Gibson is credited with 115 verifiable HR in Negro League play, plus 44 in Mexican League play, which was a bit lower level competition than MLB.  Gibson hit .359 against Negro League competition, which would be second highest of all time (behind Cobb) had he done so in an integrated majors, and Cobb's .366 might have lost a few points as well had he had to face Negro pitchers like Lefty Cooper and Willie Foster.

The raw numbers are still small.  We can't do anything about that.  115 compares very badly to 714, much less 762.  But it's still important to know those numbers, because it's what he did against major league-level competition.  What he did against amateur and semi-pro competition in exhibition games is fun to know (if we truly did know), but it is not the true measure of his worth, and (IMO) it insults the man's memory to artificially pad his numbers.  Understanding that Babe Ruth hit HIS home runs in a league that played 154 games per season, that homers were easier to hit in Ruth's league than Gibson's (livelier baseballs in the AL), the relative numbers make Gibson look like Ruth's peer.

With few exceptions, there are no researchers who do not believe that Josh Gibson was one of the two or three best pure power hitters in the game, and no exceptions among serious Negro League researchers.  We can (and in fact should) report that there have been various reports of his accomplishments in earlier days, but these numbers, taken without any context present a superman as unbelievable as that X-Files episode (""""The Unnatural"""").

You have to trust that the reason for putting up Gibson's reduced stats has a noble purpose.  Telling people that Gibson hit 800+ HR and batted .384 against all levels of competition tells nothing really, because he could have in reality hit .200 with no HR against top-level Negro League teams, but fattened up by counting 1,000 games against Little League comptetition.  Telling them he hit .359 and had a home run every sixteen at bats in a career that included many games in Griffith Stadium tells them something of importance  it gives us an excellent clue as to how he would have hit in the Majors, had he been allowed to play.

The """"nearly 800"""" and """"962"""" numbers give us no way of being able to separate them and understand their meaning.  An official scorer counted every one of Babe Ruth's HR in his major league career, and we can go back to sources from that day and find it.  In Gibson's case, someone reported (sometimes months later) numbers that no one even at that time could verify, because a lot of the numbers were based on hearsay, and some were just plain made-up.  We can't tell how many he hit over a 150-foot fence against a 17-year-old kid with a 60 MPH fastball, because we can't separate them.

There's plenty of space on the internet for repeating urban legend as fact.  Wikipedia should not be one of them.

"Wording and Clarification, + lack of source 

I have two changes that I suggest for the article:

'Parapsychology involves research that does not rely upon scientific modeling'.

This is an unsourced statement, and is a fairly bold statement to make. Whilst it may be true, I would suggest a source be found with examples of said methodological flaws, otherwise it should be removed.

'Critics such as Ray Hyman suggest that parapsychology has no methodological flaws that can explain apparently the successful experimental results that parapsychologists attribute to paranormal explanations, and various critics have classed the field as pseudoscience.'

Now this seems to be intended to be against parapsychology, yet the passage reads that there are no methodological flaws that can explain the results. Given that most attacks on parapsychology are aimed at exposing results as fake or due to methodological issues, this doesn't make sense.

Additionally, 'apparently the successful experimental results' does not read well. If this is intended to be a criticism, then perhaps it should be phrased 'the apparently successful experimental results'.

Finally 'various critics have classed the field as pseudoscience'. I do not have as much of an issue with this, yet the sources given include Hyman and Wiseman, both noted skeptics. Whilst their credentials are solid, the later part of the section names them as independent researchers, which is open to debate given their a priori stance that psychic phenomena do not exist.

preventative measures:
dependant upon control and elimination of the insect vector .
There is currently no artificial means of prevention.
Methods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where malaria is endemic, include prophylactic drugs, mosquito eradication, and the prevention of mosquito bites. There is currently no vaccine that will prevent malaria, but this is an active field of research.

Some drugs that can be used for treatment of malaria can also be used for its preventative qualities however they need to be taken daily or weekly. These are seldom used by those living in a malaria abundant enivornment and are commonyl found amongst travellers visitng regions of hight malaria activity.
Quinine was used starting in the seventeenth century as a prophylactic against malaria. The development of more effective alternatives such as quinacrine, chloroquine, and primaquine in the twentieth century reduced the reliance on quinine. Today, quinine is still used to treat chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum, as well as severe and cerebral stages of malaria, but is not generally for malaria prophylaxis.

Modern drugs used preventively include mefloquine (Lariam®), doxycycline (available generically), and atovaquone proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone®). The choice of which drug to use is usually driven by what drugs the parasites in the area are resistant to, as well as side-effects and other considerations. The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting taking the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and must continue taking them for 4 weeks after leaving (atovaquone proguanil only needs be started 2 days prior and continued for 7 days afterwards).

Controlling the vector is the most useful way of preventing the spread of malaria.
Efforts to eradicate malaria by eliminating mosquitoes have been successful in some areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but the draining of wetland breeding grounds and better sanitation, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from affluent regions. In 2002, there were 1,059 cases of malaria reported in the US, including eight deaths. In five of those cases, the disease was contracted in the United States. Malaria was eliminated from the northern parts of the USA in the early twentieth century, and the use of the pesticide DDT eliminated it from the South by 1951. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a major public health effort to eradicate malaria worldwide by selectively targeting mosquitoes in areas where malaria was rampant.[12] However, these efforts have so far failed to eradicate malaria in many parts of the developing world - the problem is most prevalent in Africa. The United States itself may face the spread of malaria in the future as climate change (warming) leads to an expansion of the areas in which mosquitoes are active..

Mosquito nets and prevention of mosquito bites

Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people, and thus greatly reduce the infection and transmission of malaria. The nets are not a perfect barrier, so they are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to search for a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets.[16] Since the Anopheles mosquitoes feed at night, the preferred method is to hang a large """"bed net"""" above the center of a bed such that it drapes down and covers the bed completely.

The distribution of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide (often permethrin) has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention. These nets can often be obtained for around US$2.50 - $3.50 (2-3 euros) from the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and others.

For maximum effectiveness, the nets should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months. This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas. A new type of impregnated net, called Olyset, releases insecticide for approximately 5 years[17], and costs about US$5.50. ITN's have the advantage of protecting people sleeping under the net and simultaneously killing mosquitoes that contact the net. This has the effect of killing the most dangerous mosquitoes. Some protection is also provided to others, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net.

Unfortunately, the cost of treating malaria is high relative to income, and the illness results in lost wages. C",0

#2 Richard 20:53 20Feb
Yeah, so the problem as I see it, is that we still don't have a good number for how many Germans died in Poland except that maybe (according to http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=260621074909720), the max is 1 million (a number that is a little too """"round"""" for my liking).

Richard, you reading very carelessly. This is 1.1 in total not round million. Or do you ridicule the estimations at start? The """"a million"""" is because more easy was to estimate the total and the 1946-1950 loses from obvious reasons. Nobody can know exact number of deaths during flight, there was complete chaos. Who died was just buried on spot at road. Some graves disappeared just because were provisionally marked only. I remember some graves of even Polish soldiers on an edge of forest which disappeared in time. The wooden crosses just disintegrated. You do not believe because you are too young.

In any event, if you look at the numbers provided in Demographic estimates of the German exodus from Eastern Europe, you see 1,225,000 deaths in the """"Eastern German territories"""" and 263,000 in Poland for a total of 1,488,000 deaths which differs from Nitschke's estimates by about 500,000.

The 500.000 is big number, too big. I would believe in accuracy if the difference would be 100.000. But Nitschke could not count the East lost Polish teritories Kresy . Any way my goal is to separate the Flight number from Expulsion number.

If you take this downward revision of 500,000 and add it to the downward revision of 150,000 or so that the joint commission of Czech and German historians proposed, you can see how the ZgV's numbers of 2 million could be revised downards to 1 - 1.2 million which is what I believe Overmans is proposing. I don't understand the 500,000 figure yet.

 This counting I do not understand. You want see the most exact total number of deaths I suppose. What I attempt is to prevent such quacking like “Poland,…murdered millions of Germans.”. We have to assume that same individuals can be handicapped and can not read and write correctly and the info should be VERY simple.

What I'm still looking for is some indication of whether Nitschke, Haar and Overmans are widely accepted as right or if they are still the minority challenging the established majority opinion.

 In my opinion you contradict yourself. You always propagated multipoint POV. I always propagate logic and comparison. We can come closer to truth only by deduction and investigation. There will be always “minority challenging the established majority opinion” as you say. Beside not always majority is right, as you know Hitler was elected and supported by majority.

It would help if we could get some quotes that evaluate the work of these historians and puts them in context of the overall consensus of academic opinion.

If you have some idea how to do it I would try. From my experience in my professional field it is really difficult to get clue who of the researches is good and who barely satisfactory. You need to be professional yourself. Regularly scientific authors do not attack openly the opponent in scientific journals. They rather systematically attack opponent theories in extend period of time. In historical journals can be the same. Maybe you understand in this context that the academic opinion is not easy to grasp. Beside, quite often you need to know the scientists personal animosities. Some Wiki editor can be smarter then me and get multi pro and contra from popular press article on internet.

"Abortion
One of the most difficult questions facing the right to life concerns the precise definition of the term ‘human life’- when exactly does ‘life’ begin and end? This controversial issue has its focus with the exact point of the commencement of human life. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it would be accorded the ‘right to life’ under the constitution. Thus, laws concerning abortion would effectively be rendered unconstitutional.

In Singapore, the Penal Code lays out the sanctions imposed if one does not comply with the Termination of Pregnancy Act- which limits abortion to patients who have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. In Malaysia, the Penal Code states that abortion is permissible within 120 days of conception, only if the pregnancy were to pose a threat to an expecting mother’s physical or mental health.  This shows that in these two jurisdictions, the states are unwilling to confer the ‘right to life’ to fetuses younger than the stipulated periods. The legislation there has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expecting mothers who are threatened by their unborn child, and made provisions for their survival.[FIND YOUR JOURNAL^^]

This is in contrast with the approach taken in other modern jurisdictions, such as the Philippines, which provides that the state shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception. The Czech Republic also states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. It is notable that the latter two jurisdictions have a predominatly Catholic majority, who are staunchly pro-life. Therefore, chances of a  universal concensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.[PROF**]

 Response 

1. Photo selection: On 3/15/07, I trimmed his four photos down to what I felt was the most representative one, even though trimming them to zero makes more common sense.  What did I do to balance out this trimming?  In the external links section, I added a link to Shankbone's gallery in Wiki Commons, which features all four pics.  Hence anyone can see all four photos with the click of a button.  """"Chivalry is truly not dead,"""" you say to yourselves.  (I even left the gallery/centered HTML around it, so that it'd be positioned right in the center for all to see, not off to one side.)  What does Shankbone then do?  He adds his other three photos back, and slyly keeps the link which I had added to his pics at the Commons.  His reasoning is that """"One photograph in a gallery looks odd.""""  He could have simply reverted to the prior version, but he looked over my changes and then only kept the one change that benefited him. He keeps talking about how he wants to compromise and work with other users, but every chance he gets, he puts himself above all other considerations and still refuses to cooperate. Why would he have even made the Commons gallery unless he understood that his photos were not main-article-worthy?  He made the Commons gallery in the first place since he correctly reasoned that that was a better location for them.  Now he has told me he will do his best to have me blocked from editing this article any further.

Back to what I previously brought up about him using this article for careerist purposes.  Why did he put his full name in the title of each of the .jpg files he uploaded?  (Roll your mouse over the photos, or attempt to download them to your hard drive, if you don't know what I'm talking about.)  That's unheard-of.  Unless, that is, he wants a lot of people to download them, and have his name conveniently attached in the file name, in case said downloaders ever want to contact the photographer and offer him $ to reprint them... 

How can he get as many people as possible to download them?  By making them as racy as possible, of course.  The point is: He could have posted clothed pictures without his name in them.  Or racy pictures without his name in them.  Or clothed ones with his name in them.  None of those possibilities would have raised the serious ethical questions that have been voiced here by multiple users.

(Technically, that counts as zero descriptive lines of her actual roles or of accolades she has received.)  However, one fashion show of hers, which took place over maybe a 2-hour span at most, is represented by around two thirds of the descriptive text in this article.  Does that seem right to anyone?  I'd like for even one Wikipedia user to lay out for me how this is correct.  Someone who had never previously heard of Subkoff would think that the U.S. media had some sort of frenzy over this one show she put on, and that her acting is so subpar as to deserve approximately 0.0 to 0.5 words per film role.  (And 100% of the two """"references"""" that he hastily added to this article are about this one-time event.)  Shankbone has consistently and subtly altered the emphasis of this article towards proving his point of view, at the expense of doing Subkoff's career justice.  In science, an experiment is never undertaken with the intent of molding the results towards proving one pre-desired hypothesis.  Any scientist who does so is branded as a sham and generally stripped of his tenure/degree/etc.  This is known as the scientific method, and has been followed for centuries.  Wikipedia was designed to be laid out in a very cold and scientific manner, to dispense nothing other than actual facts about certain objects and entities.  It's not an arena for positing one's own spin on objects and entities.  If you don't like cold and non-biased data, then Wikipedia isn't the place for you.  I often go to entries on my favorite bands/movies/etc. (and I'm even talking about ones that have drastically changed my life, or bands that I like enough to have interviewed them in the past) and delete anything with even the tiniest whiff of favoritism.

3. Style.com link: I went to the style.com link that Shankbone provided.  This link simply reinforces my position.  What it shows is 36 pictures of this event.  The models are topless in 6 of the pictures.  The models are fully clothed in 30 of the pictures.  Tell me how Shankbone's four topless pics provide an accurate overview of",0

"""

 Edits proposed to plot description 

""""“Joliet” Jake Blues is released from the Joliet Correctional Center after serving three years of a prison sentence after being convicted of armed robbery.""""

Entry for Joliet Correctional Center.

""""Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own.""""

It's unclear here, however the Caddy Jake refers to may be Murph and the Magictones' pink vehicle first seen in the """"Howard Johnson's"""" scene where Jake and Elwood phone Maury Sline and are blasted the flame-throwing mystery woman. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment).

Part of the film's humour is the actual name of the orphanage. Credit to Kathleen Freeman. People erroneously thing charities and churches are completely tax-exempt; however the exemption most notably only extends to Federal income taxes. The property tax bill would probably have remained an unforeclosed lien had the church not decided to sell voluntarily to the Board of Education.

""""At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Show Band and Revue.""""

Credit to Cab Calloway and James Brown.
  
""""As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall.""""

Entry for Bluesmobile; since location in Chicago and Illinois is obviously a major plot element, reference that the particular law-enforcement agency here is the ISP; SCMODS article already exists, with explanation of the meaning, in this context; article exists for Dixie Square Mall. 

""""After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher).""""

Credit cast member Carrie Fisher; this scene is cut from many televised versions, DVD featurette commentary explains that Canadian actor Aykroyd felt this scene explained the Bluesmobile's magical abilities, yet director Landis felt this was not transparent.

""""The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room. The mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.""""

Candy's character was important because he assisted in locating Elwood's abode; the 'Wrigley Field bit' is important plot-element humor.

""""Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with",0

Question about Edit

Where is the proper place to put forth an individual and allow his talents to be fully utilized? Would you suggest I use the edited text as the basis for an RFA? Surely any poly-degreed Oxforder with 18,000 edits in 22 months can be, indeed is, a formidable Wikipedian exerting a vast influence on the quality and tone of the project. Here is the meat of the text - I would appreciate any guidance you might be willing to offer:

I think this project could possibly use the help of the Editor . He has not one, but Two, degrees from Oxford - has written several books [Love Songs and Other Mysteries (1991) - Bad Choice (1989) - Sorry, No ISBN numbers exist to link to ...] and has made just a hair under Eighteen Thousand edits in 22 months at Wiki. 

As he has frequently invoked the """"Superior Authority"""" of his multiple Oxford degrees and education and on numerous occasions brandished his Oxon academic honors to defend and enshrine his edits in Wikipedia and to eliminate the need for discussion, perhaps he could be of some use here - building the entry for his alma mater. Surely an American 'emergency responder', author, 18,000 count wiki Editor, and pedigreed intellectual with the rare accomplishment of two Oxford post graduate degrees would be of special use to the project.  

""""With respect, I went to Oxford, so i am fairly well aware of Brit English...penultimate being the climax of the story."""" - Arcayne

""""Regarding the 'penultimate' stuff - not worries - as I said, it's just a word. I always thought is was used as next to the end, as in right before the ending. A slightly different meaning has become popular, like how the original phrase """"buck naked"""" (meaning, naked as a male deer) becoming mispronounced so often that now people say """"butt-naked"""". It would render me a crabby old man to decry the loss of the word meanings. It was also make me something of a jerk. Words evolve. - Arcayne  14:34, 3 July 2008""""

""""I did attend Oxford. I did graduate from there with the two degrees I have previously noted"""" - Arcayne

These are the two degrees Arcayne previously noted:
the EU is not a single nation, nor is the UN or UAE. They are actually something called NGO's, or non-governmental organizations.  - Arcayne
 The EU is nothing BUT a governmental organization. Its purpose is to politically unite the countries within the European Community. ... it is a united entity. Ditto the UAE. Kapowow 
Are you seriously trying to suggest that the EU is not an NGO? ... If you consider me throwing my political science and international relations degrees at you to be derogatory, then I have to say that I am sorry you feel that way.

For the copyright issue, it is not enough to assert permission: you would have to follow the steps in the warning notice above. Be aware that in posting information on Wikipedia, you are making an irrevocable and very general release by which others may copy your text, modify it, and use it for any purpose - see Foundation:Terms of Use and WP:Copyrights#Contributors' rights and obligations.

But there are other issues. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a business listing directory, still less a web-host for you to """"provide online the content of our corporate documentation,"""" and it is unlikely that your documentation is suitable for an encyclopedia article. 

Also, in writing about your company, you have a conflict of interest.
Wikipedia is not a vehicle for any kind of promotion. Articles have to be of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article: the Wikipedia term for that is notability, and the requirements are explained in the guideline on Notability and in more detail in Notability (organizations and companies). Articles need to be verifiable from independent, reliable sources - a company's own website does not count as independent - and independent references are the best way to demonstrate notability. Also, articles must be written from a neutral point of view, and so people are strongly discouraged from writing about themselves or their own organizations, because of the conflict of interest involved. If you do write on such subjects, follow the advice in User:Uncle G/On notability#Writing about subjects close to you:
When writing about subjects that are close to you, don't use your own personal knowledge of the subject, and don't cite yourself, your web site, or the subject's web site.  Instead, use what is written about the subject by other people, independently, as your sources.  Cite those sources in your very first edit.  If you don't have such sources, don't write

 Nice job on autism causes page 

  Common sense award I think what is on the causes of autism page is well done.  I also like your common sense approach.  I am not really sure how to send you a message on content but thought I would try this.  I see the vitamin D deficiency hypothesis which should be there because it is in the literature, but the hypothesis does not make any sense because oral supplementation of vitmain D among the very young has increased dramatically over the last 20 years and autism increases with it.  An alternative cause of the epidemic is the opposite: too much vitamin D supplementation and fortification among the very young, which makes a lot of sense considering the calcium channel nature of many autism syndromes, the biochemistry of those with autism, and the epidemic.  I have a book about it on amazon and some academics have told me the ideas in it are provacative.  Does something need significant media exposure before it can appear in wikipedia?  As you seem to know a lot about autism causes would you have any interest in reviewing it?  I could send you a .pdf copy.   
 Hi, .  I appreciate your kind words, but causes of autism in fact, most of our autism articles was mostly written by now-departed ; it would need to be a high-quality journal because autism is a featured article, and it would need to be an independent secondary review per our medical sourcing guidelines.

sources:     Normal   0                         MicrosoftInternetExplorer4         from Prothero, Donald, 2004, Bringing Fossils to life,  McGraw Hill Higher Education, pp. 8-18.

Taphonomy

“The study of how living organisms become fossilized is known as taphonomy.  … From the moment an organism dies, there is a tremendous loss of information as it decays and is trampled, tumbled, and broken before it is buried.  The more of that lost information that we can reconstruct, the more reliable our scientific hypotheses are likely to be.  ….  From the original complete assemblage of living organism, known as a ‘life assemblage” or biocenosis, many events occur that screen out certain organisms, leaving a much smaller death assemblage, or thanatocenosis.  The process of breakup and decay of organism immediately after death is known as necrolysis. 

“After a death assemblage accumulates, many other factors operate on the hard parts to break them up and scatter them around, so an even smaller percentage ends up buried for future fossilization.  These processes occur after necrolysis and are known as biostratinomy.  These agents of destruction can be biological, mechanical, or chemical.

“Biological agents are the most important factor in most environments, both marine and terrestrial.  Both predators and scavengers are very active in breaking up shells and bones ….  In summary, the key factor that prevents biological destruction is rapid burial.”

For those organism that are not buried right away:

“Mechanical agents of destruction such as wind, waves, and currents can be very important.  These processes are most effective in shallow waters, where both waves and storm have their highest energies.  … In summary, the shape, density, and thickness of the bone or shell are the most important factors in determining survival under mechanical transport [until burial].”

“After burial a variety of digenetic [chemical] changes in the rock can easily destroy shells.  … In summary, the original composition and the groundwater chemistry are the most important factors in determining whether digenetic changes are likely to alter or dissolve a fossil.”

“Taphonomic research has come a long way since the pioneering studies of the 1960s and 1970s.  Paleontologists can no longer afford to naively take the fossil record at face value, but must always keep in mind the taphonomic “noise” that may obscure the original biological ‘signal’.”

Lagerstatten:

“The processes outlined above account for most fossilization and what we know of the living organism is usually quite incomplete.  However, there are extraordinary fossil deposits around the world that preserve soft tissues and sometimes even skin texture and color patterns. … These are known as Lagerstatten (German for “mother lode”), and they have produced some of the most important fossils known.  … From all these examples, several general trends emerge.  The best fossilization occurs when there is rapid burial and anoxic conditions to prevent scavenging, no reworking currents and little or no digenetic alteration to destroy the fossils.”

The Museum of the Rockies here in Bozeman is the realm of paleontologist Jack Horner.  I have often heard Jack speak, pointing out that the dinosaurs of Montana were almost all killed and buried by catastrophic river floods near the shore of the inland sea that is now Eastern Montana, the Dakotas and related Canadian States.  The bones and the geology both acclaim to that.  Of course, these floods are considered local in extant.  This same theme is echoed on many signs and posters through out the museum.",0

 You're the one-eyed leader of a pack of blind """"specialists"""" that insist on editing articles about Greece lacking basic information about the country at best (when censuses happen) or purposefully ignoring it at worst (did you ever do anything about the bogus """"census"""" number?).
 For all your """"expertise"""" the whole lot of your gang still cannot write something reliable when it comes to the numbers of linguistic groups in Greece. I drop the hint about the V-PRC survey and your sorry lot still go on about Kiesling's State Department estimate. 
 Even after citing the Eurominority reports (while making sure the Arvanitika in Epirus are shown as Albanian) you still have not updated your map of linguistic minorities in Greece to show the Arvanites in Thrace. I mean you fools show half of my island as Arvanite speaking when the language is unfortunately almost entirely lost and despite there being more active speakers in Thrace you don't even show them. So much for """"expertise"""" and respect for the sources.
 You complain that you are misunderstood with respect to your broad use of the color brush in the map of Macedonian Slavic dialects in Greece even when it is pointed out to you that your color maps include areas where there were never any settlements of Slavic speaking villages at all. Then you trivialize objections (""""a few kilometers"""" etc.) and suggest that what you do is perfectly kosher. But when you prepare a similar map of Greek dialects http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Modern_Greek_dialects_en.svg instead of following the same rationale and including areas of minimal use of the Greek language (even if it was in the past and no more - just as you argue for your Macedonian map) you stop at the borders of Greece. Obviously the Greeks in Albania and Bulgaria (I won't bother with the Greek linguistic presence - especially in the past - in the Bitola, Gevgelija and Strumica region as I expect them to be invisible to you) are not worth recording (or maybe they are mute in your pretty little world). What about the Greek speaking Turks still left in Turkey (mainly from Crete and Macedonia as well as the Pontus)? I mean OK, screw the linguistic presence in Turkey before 1922 - you obviously have perverse ideas of what time boundaries to use - but at least respect today's reality. If my grandfather's bilingual generation of Arvanite speakers make half the island of Andros Arvanite should you not indicate the presence of the Greek speaking old-people in Turkey?

That the nominator did not conduct the most simple research before nominating these templates for deletion is shown here: the fact that the TfD notice was not included within  tags led to the disruption of over 5000 articles, something which the nominator could have prevented had he thought to used simple discussion before even contemplating bringing the matter here. The disruption was completely predictable, given that the nominator chose to nominate more than 200 templates at once. The speedy keep does not imply any judgment on the accessibility questions raised in the discussion, which should be addressed in more appropriate fora.  (talk) 
I have no objection to this being closed as keep, as there was consensus in that direction; but that was a provocative and insulting closure notice.
Firstly, it seems you're yet another person who has never actually bothered to read Wikipedia:Speedy keep, as your reasons for speedy keeping are at odds with what is written there. Secondly, it is not at all clear why TFD is not the place to discuss a vast collection of templates whose only purpose is a gimmick that breaks web accessibility. Thirdly, the whole point of the  template is for it to be transcluded with the template, in order to advertise the discussion. If I had noincluded it, I might well have been accused of trying to hide the discussion. Therefore your suggestion that I """"did not conduct the most simple research"""" is a great steaming load of crap.
It is pretty obvious from the hostile tone of your response, together with the fact that you're deeply involved in chemistry articles, that you didn't like the nomination, and decided to speedy close the discussion instead of just saying your piece and waiting for an unbiased closure. That is a misuse of your administrative privileges.
And before you discard this discussion as just another rant by a disgruntled troll, you might note that I've been here as long as you have, and I've been an administrator as long as you have. Hesperian """,0

Norman,

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site started as a non-commercial site and contains a great deal of island history as well as many, many island pictures. It's one of the most popular sites in the Lake Erie Islands.

Please take a look at """"Site Map Page 1"""" and """"Site Map Page 2"""" before removing the link again. Saying that the hundreds of pages listed there have only commercial value is idiotic.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

So what is your real rationale for deleting it again and again and again???

4th paragraph
The 4th paragraph is wrong. 

The black body temperature of the Earth is 5.5 °C.[4] Since the Earth reflects about 28% of incoming sunlight[5], in the absence of the greenhouse effect the planet's mean temperature would be far lower - about -18 or -19 °C [6][7] instead of the much higher current mean temperature, about 14 °C.

The black body temperature of the Earth is -18 or -19 °C, not 5.5 °C (which is the temperature of an ideal blackbody the same distance from the Sun as the Earth). It was correct before it was changed on Dec 9,2009. Also, reference [4] does not support that statement. I suggest the following as a possible replacement paragraph and even as a possible first paragraph since it actually defines what Greenhouse Effect really refers to.

If an ideal thermally conductive blackbody was the same distance from the Sun as the Earth, it would have an expected blackbody temperature of 5.3 °C. However, since the Earth reflects about 30%NASA Earth Fact Sheet (or 28%Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry, by Daniel J. Jacob, Princeton University Press, 1999. Chapter 7, """"The Greenhouse Effect"""".) of the incoming sunlight, the planet's actual blackbody temperature is about -18 or -19 °C Solar Radiation and the Earth's Energy BalanceIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. Chapter 1: Historical overview of climate change science page 97, about 33°C below the actual surface temperature of about 14 °C or 15 °C.The elusive """"absolute surface air temperature,"""" see GISS discussion The mechanism that produces this difference between the actual temperature and the blackbody temperature is due to the atmosphere and is known as the Greenhouse Effect.

Note that I also modified the expected temperature and albedo based on NASA data. If the values in the current paragraph are used in Stephan's equation, 5.5°C with no reflection is associated with -16.5°C with 28% reflection and -18°C with 30%.   """,0

On page 300, the author writes: """"The Sikh Chamar or Ramdasia. — It will be seen from Table VIII A that in the north and centre of the Eastern Plains a very considerable number of Chamiirs have embraced the Sikh religion. These men are called Ramdasia after Gui-u Ram Das, though what connection they have with him I have been unable to discover. Perhaps he was the first Guru to admit Chamars to the religion. Many, perhaps most of the Ramdasia Chamars have abandoned leather-work for the loom ; they do not eat carrion, and they occupy a much higher position than the Hindu Chamars, though they are not admitted to religious equality by the other Sikhs. The Ramdasia are often confused with the Raidiisi oi Rabdasi Chamars. The former are true Sikhs, and take the pdhul. The latter are Hindus, or if Sikhs, only Nanakpanthi Sikhs and do not take the pcikul ; and are followers of Bhagat Rav Das or Rab Das, himself a Chamar. They are apparently as true Hindus as any Chamars can be, and are wrongly called Sikhs by confusion with the Ranidasias"""".

 Past tense. (Apologies in advance for any typos - bad keyboard and limited time - also, I'll try to put across a coherent argument without letting emotions get in the way, but I am really angry about this (for reasons I'll explain later)) It is incorrect English to say that events happening over a 22 year span all happened at once (i.e. in the present). For example, to say that """"EastEnders begins"""" is incorrect. EastEnders began. In 1985. The article as it is at the moment (in present tense) reads like EastEnders is a film - with a set end, which we know it is not - it keeps running. It is my strong belief that events that happened in the past in something that runs in real time should also be written in real time (i.e. past tense for things that hapened in the past) - an argument that I have seen all three editors above use at different times. One of the reasons I am angry about this is that certain editors seem to have such a disregard for our language and the way it should be written, that they are willing to forget all about grammar and write this article (which, in my opinion, and as stated by Gungadin elsewhere) is harder to read than it was before, in past tense - just to get this article to FA status - how glory-seeking is that!? Don't get me wrong, it'd be great for this article to get to FA status, but to totally forget about good grammar just because the policy pushers (may I add that WP:TENSE is a guideline, not a policy) say that it needs to be in present tense juts takes the biscuit. WP:TENSE was obviously decided without taking into account real time series - something myself and Elonka have raised on various talk pages to try and change this, but as soon as I have gone away it seems everyone has changed their minds and are happy to have this article written in bad, hard to read English, just to get it to FA status.

"""Concerning one point of disagreement concerning policy formulation in the above discussion, I would suggest that the normal approach is:
Yes, knowing something to be untrue, is generally accepted as a reason to tag or remove material. In fact, the extreme argument, which I do not have much sympathy with, is that questioning un-sourced material is always acceptable, no matter what the intention. (But then people generally add some proviso when arguing this extreme version, such as """"except when we are talking about obvious behavior issues"""".)
Trying to formulate what less extreme people think, I would say that believing something to be unlikely to be something that people could come to a consensus about being true is a valid reason for tagging or removing material.
This is perfectly consistent with our real way of working: verifiability, the ability to confirm that something is what rational people could agree to be true, is our threshold for inclusion, but not personal opinions about what is true.

 Reason for this article? 

Has anybody put forth a rational, NPOV argument for why this article's contents are incapable of being integrated into other articles about Japanese history and culture? We don't have articles for the Greek influence on Italian culture, the Chinese influence on Korean culture, the Indian influence on Chinese culture, the Arab influence on Persian culture, the Turkic influence on Anatolian culture, Japanese & American influence on modern Korean culture, etc. despite the fact that all of these influences were significant and frequently cited in academic literature - so why exactly is there a page for specifically ancient """"Korean"""" influence on """"Japanese"""" culture? I agree with the editors who state that the presence of such an article encourages tit-for-tat nationalism and it's as plain as day that such edit wars have already begun. Allowing this article to exist encourages future articles of the same sort and equally heated edit wars.

I suggest moving the article's contents into other articles relevant to the subjects cited. For example, the section about """"Koreans"""" being on the committee that drafted the Taiho Code can be placed under Taiho Code, where it belongs in the first place.   """,0

Montalban is quite right - I have supported the inclusion of opposition arguments in this article, particularly from an Orthodox perspective.  And quite a body of material has been gathered that meets that objective. However, from a readability viewpoint, the article had become cumbersome to the point of unuseability. I have repeatedly requested Montalban to recognise this fact and to take measures to address it that would retain the arguments while improving the reading experience. It is for that reason that I have refrained from comment in this article for a long time now in the hope that this holy peace would bear fruit. I have been disappointed in this hope. With the creation of the other article, the imperative to have all the material in this particular article became less obvious. Given Montalban's obduracy, I finally lent my suport to a radical solution - the wholesale transport of sections to that other article.

"Nonsense. The Syrian army committed 1,500 men. They were wholly unprepared for the war, having received notice that they were to fight just a few days before the 15th of May. Their logistics were poor - they had handed over a part of their munition reserves to the Arab Salvation Army, and given its scarcity of war matériel had to husband what was left. Its knowledge of the theatre of war where it was to conduct operations was minimal. It took then almost a week to get their tanks over the Jordan. Their first advance was roundly defeated, with heavy losses. On the 18th under Husni Zaim they attacked and took Samakh, south of Tiberias, only to lose it in three days after an Israeli-kibbutznik counter attack. This massive army 'with artillary, tanks, (armed?)armoured cars and airforce stocked with Harvards, (not Harvard-armed aircraft!!, which is a brilliantly comical image)' took 4 days, involving almost all that the Syrian army could muster, to capture a little  moshava like Mishmar HaYarden, with its 20 local guards (Tal p.261) which had to fight on its own, without IDF assistance.
Secondly, you really should stop this nonsense about RS bias. Morris is biased against the Palestinian/Arab side, anyone can see that, but he is eminently good on the facts. Laurens is perhaps the most neutral of all, but he gives the Arab version a much more intelligent coverage than others. Morris, Tal, Gelber, Laurens are all RS, and that's all that counts. One cannot challenge one of them, as if the others were somehow engaged in 'neutral' coverage.",0

Sure. I don't have the necessary knowledge to correct these sections. The most egregious error is the following statement: """"His system of government, which may be described as a benevolent despotism, was perhaps that best suited to the character of his subjects.""""

It implies that the Montenegrins were unable to govern themselves and needed a wise father to gently raise them into civilization. If this is true, it needs a citation, but I'm sure there were plenty of trade unionists and republicans who disagreed at least slightly ;-)

The following phrases read as excessively fawning, slightly biased or perhaps just worded in an old-fashioned style:

""""the young highlander, whose keen patriotism, capability for leadership and poetic talents early displayed themselves, showed no inclination for the pleasures of the French capital, and eagerly looked forward to returning to his native land.""""

First, I'd like to thank you for discussing this issue with me.  You could just have told me to take a hike or something.  Anyway, let's take a look at Image:Esquire Jennifer Connelly 1991 8.jpg, the Jennifer Connelly picture that I tagged today.  The image was moved to the infobox this morning which means that it was not being used according to the license.  It was instead being used specifically to depict Connelly, not in context of discussing that particular issue of the magazine.  That's why I tagged that image.  With the image moved back to the paragraph concerning the issue of the magazine, a compelling argument could be made that the image is now being used in accord with the license.  This seems to be the consensus of the people on the discussion page as well, though the discussion just started.  So, whether or not this image is fair-use depends on how it is used in the article.  I am much happier if this is spelled out in a rationale on the image page.  That the license specifically states that a detailed fair-use rationale should be added seems, to me, to support this contention.  In this case, the rationale would be simple, something along the lines of, """"used to depict issue of magazine in question in paragraph which discusses this issue, not solely to depict Connelly.""""  Now, I previously mentioned that the image description page specifically mentions that the dvdcover requires a detailed rationale.  In many cases, the fair-use case is obvious.  It's a DVD cover used to illustrate the particular DVD in question.  But the image description page and the license text both still indicate that the rationale is required.  Also, what often ends up happening is that the DVD image then gets used to depict something outside of the license.  A DVD of a movie starring Connelly, for example, used solely to illustrate what Connelly looks like.
Now, I've been using the fair-use-disputed tag for quite some time but recently, people have been correcting that to the missing-rationale tag, so I just started using that.  This has the added advantage of requiring that the issue be resolved in short order and providing a simple copy-and-paste official warning template which can be used (and is specifically designed) to warn the person who uploaded the image.
I am concerned that a great number of images on Wikipedia are used in blatant violation of copyright.  This is clear and I doubt anyone would debate it.  As a result, I personally do request that people who upload copyrighted images provide an accurate source, an accurate license, and a detailed fair-use rationale.  In all honesty, I'm quite happy with any reasonable attempt at a fair-use rationale and accept many that I believe fall far short of what Wikipedia officially requests.  I believe it is important to deal with images without sufficient information because continuing to accept images which may violate copyright put us at direct risk.  It may be obvious to the uploader why an image is fair-use but we may not be able to contact the uploader when we are sued.  And as I mentioned before, I believe both the license and image description help page specifically require this.
Now that I have stated my point and you have stated your point, there's a very good chance that we aren't going to agree.  I'm happy to request additional help, perhaps from the admin noticeboard policies page, if you think this would be productive.

 It would be useful if you dated your comments, it's much easier to follow the dates that way, rather than checking the history. I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:

It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.

 That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.

 Let me explain what I mean with my """"intuitiveness"""" concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply """"antigravity"""" to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's """"beating"""" some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to """"beat"""" as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn't really exist, that confuses the reader (""""then what's the force that I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn't get it right..."""") and s/he's most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  """,0

Why have you removed the edit to the suicide section in Emile Durkheim's page which mentioned that egoistic suicide is also known as egotistical suicide?  This is a productive edit, as many editions/translations refer to only one term and not the other.  Readers should be aware of the relation between the terms.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 192.246.234.74   
It's redundant. Egotistic- and egotistical-suicide are the same thing.   
That is the point to stating that it is """"also known as"""" the other term.  The words are not the same: egoistic refers more to a general self-centered nature while egotistical refers more to a self-centered way of thinking and speaking.  Look up the terms and you will see that they are not perfect synonyms.  The implications of both terms on the semantics and the basic message of Durkheim's theory is significant.  This information - a matter of 5 words - should be included in Wikipedia's article.  Both are valid terms with different implications.  It would not be the first time a Wikipedia article lists multiple terms for the same thing.
According Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary they're the same words. 'He performed an egotistic suicide for egotistical reasons', same thing.   
Unless that was a typo, you just used exactly the same word twice.  The difference is between EGOISTIC (one 'T') and EGOTISTICAL (two 'T's).  Look up the two words in Merriam-Webster.  —Preceding [[Wik",0

"""    We do not endorse the group that goes by a copycat name, """"gfia""""   

following is a repaste of last complete version...

The guineafowl are a family of birds in the same order as the pheasants, turkeys and other game birds. They are also widely known as guineahens, (a term formerly applied to the turkey).

This is an African family of insect and seed-eating, ground-nesting birds resembling partridges, but with featherless heads and spangled grey plumage. The Helmeted Guineafowl has been domesticated and introduced outside its natural range, for example in southern France and the West Indies. 

Guineas are monogamous, spending their lives with the same mate. They lay 25-30 eggs in a deep, tapering nest. Their eggs are small, and dark. The hens have a habit of hiding their nests, and sharing it with others until large numbers of eggs have accumulated. The incubation period is 26-28 days, and the babies are called """"keets."""" They are highly susceptible to dampness (after all, they come from drier areas of Africa) and can die from following the mother through dewy grass. Though, after their first two weeks, they can be some of the hardiest domestic land fowl. 

Sexing the birds is not as simple as telling a rooster from a hen chicken. When they are adults, the helmet and wattles of the male are larger then the female, and the female is the only one to make the two-note cry """"Buck-wheat!"""" Aside from that, however, the two sexes are mostly identical in appearance. 

As domestics, guineas are valuable pest controllers, delighting in ridding your yard and garden of insects. They are especially beneficial in controlling the lyme disease carrying deer tick, as well as annoying wasp nests. While they are rarely kept in large numbers, a few are sometimes kept with other fowl to be used as a security system against hawks. No intruder or stranger will get past the eye of a guinea, and they will call, loudly, with their high shrieking voices. They are highly social birds, and hate to be alone. 

Within the domesticated species, many color variations have been created aside from the """"pearl"""" or natural color of the helmeted guinea. These include White, purple, slate, chocolate, lavander, and coral blue.

 Why was the Oliver Nicholson quote removed? 

There used to be a small quote from Oliver Nicholson in the Fifth Element section. Why was it removed? It was from """"Tesla's self-sustaining electrical generator"""", The historical ether. Proceedings of the Tesla Centenial Symposium, 1984. 

It read as follows:
Oliver Nicholson points out that, in contrast to the better known luminiferous aether of the 19th century, the older concept of the classical aether had three properties. Among these characteristics, the classical aether had a non-material property, was """"less than the vehicle of visible light"""", and was responsible for """"generating metals"""" along with fostering the development of all bodies.

My dear fellow - what is yours? 92.4.216.135  

I'll be completely honest with you.  Some of the stuff I see is pretty funny, and sometimes I chuckle.  However, I use Wikipedia quite often to research random subjects.  With that being said, I don't like to see stupid crap plastering an article.  If you want to vandalize something besides an article (i.e. user pages, talk pages, etc.), I really don't care as long as its not mine.  Other people might care but not me.  Just leave the articles alone, unless of course you're adding useful information.   Ndenison talk 

 Hair trigger revert? 

You reverted my changes to Game Artificial Intelligence in the cheating AI section. These changes focused the section on the importance of cheating to AI itself; the section as it stood got too distracted by the wider considerations of cheating, and by specific examples.

With all due respect, the criticism section as it stands is a total mess. Setting aside the fact that it reads as if the year is 2001, an inordinate amount of text is devoted to a recitation of the Bovard article, which is A) a clear partisan attack piece (it begins with a snide and largely irrelevant attack on then-president Clinton's character), B) a shoddy piece of opinion journalism overwrought with loaded assumptions (witness the dismissive tone about """"politically correct noncompetitive recreation""""), and C) dated. Did nobody else notice this thing is almost a decade old? Yet it is being used as the backbone for the longest subsection on an organization that is evolving, growing, and changing to this very day. Bovard *does* bring facts to the table but as it stands now they are sitting in a void of time and space. His article does not make it clear how statistically representative the examples of """"corruption"""" were to Americorps as it functioned circa 1993-1999, let alone Americorps as it functions today.

I am not an expert by any means on Wikipedia's guidelines, I have never added or edited an article and it would not be appropriate for me to start here. But given this article's immediate onslaught of criticism, I would have expected an ongoing narrative about whether any stuck (especially with the imminent arrival of a conservative presidency) and how (and why) Americorps changed throughout the Bush years, leading into its present growth. Instead what we are left with is the cluttered product of a single user's anti-government tirade. I am not against noting that libertarians have a death wish for Americorps, but take, for instance, the section about Bovard's """"unofficial source,"""" who dismisses the reading program. From the beginning it was a rather questionable inclusion, but it is flatly contradicted by the study cited thereafter. Again, I'm no Wikipedia expert, but it seems to me an empirical measurement of reality should trump the anonymously-sourced attack from a pundit with a clear agenda. Why, then, is this whole exchange even necessary?

Equally embarrassing is the sentence about GED students, who now apparently need to be stigmatized for no reason. The short """"Articles suggest..."""" paragraph is only a little less disastrous; it presupposes that helping people get welfare is a bad thing, a judgment call which I think ought to be left to the reader. And even setting all that aside, why, from a journalistic point of view, does the above paragraph re-introduce the Bovard article? It disrupts the readability of this page, making it all the clearer that the criticism section comes from someone who is more concerned with piling one slanted attack after another than with writing an informative, cogent article. Narrative context is jettisoned in yet another paragraph (""""There have been a number of criticisms..."""") which goes on to raise vague, weaselly arguments sourced by an article that returns a 404. The user above me has a raised a critique that I think is also fair about the last paragraph's apparent opposition to the concept of self-esteem.

If I could make a suggestion (and given my lack of Wiki experience I freely welcome its rejection) this whole section, as well as the one above it, needs to be wiped clean. There is nothing wrong with noting that Americorps had some issues in the '90s, so long as this article leaves one able to discern that we are no longer living in the '90s. As it stands, the specific citations strike me as largely irrelevant cases of excess scrutinizing. The $20k+ cost to the taxpayer per volunteer is a valuable piece of information and should not be omitted from this article. It should also not be mentioned without reference to the benefits that Americorps volunteers provide. Contrary to the what the criticism section implies, it does not seem likely that tens of thousands of volunteers per year are being paid only to paint murals and put on puppet shows. If this means that Wiki editors have to conduct more contemporary research (the last 3-4 years seeming most appropriate) in order to determine just what services Americorps volunteers provide and who they affect, so be it. No doubt it would be even more difficult to assess how Americorps changes the lives and attitudes of its volunteers (and perhaps I am biased supposing from the onset that it creates more generous public services) but this, too, would be a benefit. Cite the cost, describe the benefits as neutrally as possible, and let the reader determine for himself whether the end result is """"efficient."""" And move on. 173.52.83.2  M32""",0

Speaking of objectivity: while what I said regarding the copula was a plausible argument for using the upper case, the fact is that different people capitalize differently in that particular situation. In fact, I think I checked more sources later and I'm pretty sure a majority of people (Edward Winter included) prefer the lower case in """"Alekhine was white"""". (I should really have done that beforehand – sorry to distort the picture.) On a somewhat related note (this is something I wanted to tell you and never got a chance to), I will suggest that """"White"""" should really only be used as a substitute for a player's name (like our policy says) and never as a substitute for """"the white pieces"""" – that latter usage (which crops up in phrases like """"Alekhine had White"""" or """"played White"""") is not documented in any dictionary I checked, including the OED; it should probably be treated as a colloquialism.

This information was removed without any explanation. Because it is a factual peice of information I replaced it (aug 28th) and for safety sake put the book I had gotten it from as a referance. I explained my edit as """"Facts are facts"""". I imagined that the matter would end here. Why would anyone insist on its removal after this point? The next day I saw that it had been removed again by the same user who explained """"if it's a fact cite a reliable source"""". A simple enough request. I thought I had already done that but no matter. I renamed referances as sources, re-added the sentance again, explained this and left it. Within the hour my edit had been reverted and a message left on my user board saying """"Your change to the page Foresters Falls, Ontario was determined to be unhelpful, and has been reverted"""". Needless to say I was a bit upset. Who determined this? who's POV about Foresters Falls is more important? What criteria are being used? I understand that the statement is not the most important ever but it certainly doesn't detract from the article. I have been attempting to have the user ArmadilloFromHell explain why he insists on it's absence but he is being very stubborn and will not answer my questions. I don't want to start harrassing people but I have no idea what to do. Here are a few of my questions:

has the community not gotten smaller? 
was it not caused by the automobile? 
have I not sourced the statement as asked? 
is it not a fact? 
is it not information? 
does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? 
is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? 
is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not? 
Why it is better to not have the statement than to have it? 
Does this information not answers a pertinant question left open by the article? 
If I were to refrase the sentance would that be better? 
What criteria was used to determine that it should be removed? 
Why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement?

The motor, blades, etc. is no different.

Challenged content

The following material has been challenged by two separate IP editors, and restored by one editor (Altenmann). Having reviewed it, it does not appear to be in an encyclopedic style and requires a rewrite. As such, I've posted it here for discussion and reworking to avoid disruption. The text in dispute is as follows:

Pincus offers managerial advice on handling difficulties caused by both types: she defines the know-it-all as the """"Truly Smart Know-It-All"""", an employee with """"a intellectual handle on the job requirements that is spectacular"""", but who """"doesn't 'see' boundaries"""", and the omniscient deity as a person who """"thinks nothing of imposing or intruding"""". Lloyd makes no such distinction, although he notes that ironically, Know-It-Alls can sometimes know what they are talking about, and simply have such a brusque style of communication that people are unwilling to listen. He characterizes Know-It-Alls as superficially domineering and controlling, but insecure underneath. The outward focus on the inferiority of their fellows is intended to mask the inner sense of their own weaknesses in knowledge, skills, and competence.
 
Pincus recommends different strategies for each type. For the case of the Truly Smart Know-It-All she observes that a manager might have to bend the rules somewhat to accommodate the negative aspects of such an employee, which include impatience, an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and other peculiarities, in order to retain the positive benefits of the employee's knowledge and experience. Although she also cautions that managers have to weigh the benefits against the taxing effects, upon managers and staff, of employing an """"outlandish prima donna"""". She also recommends that rule-bending not extend to allowing the peculiarities of a true know-it-all with odd habits to be displayed to outsiders, such as customers and other visitors, and that such employees be clearly requested not to flout their eccentricities when such visitors call. She also states that managers should not be afraid of asking a genius employee questions, and should insist upon mutual respect and not adopt a self-deprecating attitude simply in order to placate such employees. Lloyd similarly advises managers to take a strong line against any form of intellectual bullying, either of others or indeed of the manager.
 
For the Know-It-All who doesn't, Pincus recommends to managers that they give praise where it is due, and that they assign such employees to work together with one, or two, other people, and regularly check for signs of stress. Notess observes that the last tactic mentioned can be unsuccessful if a Know-It-All is paired with a novice, since the Know-It-All quickly takes control away from the novice.
 
LLoyd observes that getting a point across to a Know-It-All can sometimes be difficult, and require much repetition, because such people are more interested in what they themselves are saying than in listening to others.

Please post suggestions for rewrites below; if we cannot find consensus, it might be worth seeking a third opinion or an RfC. '''chatspy """,0

As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: """"International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and """"Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group"""". Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression """"telephone centrals"""" instead of """"exchanges"""" is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. From the so called Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label, informs the Economist in its 3rd August edition, in an article called """"Propaganda Wars Returns"""".

{{unblock|1=
Ruslik0 is incorrect in his block of me. I wasn't edit waring as defined by Wikipedia: I made one reversion of an edit today.

Furthermore, Ruslik0 is incorrect that I made a false accusation regarding the objective fact that Jeffro77 is engaging in vandalism: Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal). That is quite a significant amount.

"Is Wikipedia a patriarchal site? 

Is Wikipedia a patriarchal site? If it isn't, may I then ask why a photo of a woman reading the Quaran is constantly removed by Islamists and no-one bothers to do anything about it? I hope you are aware that this encyclopedia is opened to all people, including extremists and even terrorists. Why do your admins allow these extremists have their way? They argue that if certain people are offended of seeing a woman reading the Quaran, then perhaps the photo should be removed. Even the photographer has been convinced to have the photo removed and now he thinks it's his fault. Here's what he said: 

My wife is particularly saddened that a picture of her is causing distress - she compares it to an image of a woman in a small bikini holding a bible in the Bible article - and she has asked that the photo be removed from the article. I personally feel that the image belongs in Timur, where the woman is needed in the image in order to show scale (at least until a replacement image of the folio with a different person is found), but that it is inappropriate to include it in the Qur'an article.

Does this sound normal to you? So if these extremists, whom I dared to call Talebans, are offended by women, then perhaps we should not have woman editors, admins, etc? I suggested to you a month ago that you need to impose more Liberal standards to Wiki and enforce them with the sword! Ban these people, please! Your admins removed my line where I called these extremists for Talebans. How shameful! Here's the photo.

2.

It is a purely croatian song which VK """"sold"""" as a """"Serbian song"""".) Also, his work in lexicography is unthinkable without Croatian heritage-for instance, in his 1847 translation of the New Testament, he explicitely stated he had coined ca. 300 new words.

I feel that this is mostly a well written and informative article and that this whole coup or counter coup thing is pointless. These events are accepted by most sources to have been a coup. What this means is that Mossadeq is accepted to have been the leader of Iran at the time in question, and to have been deposed. The phrase counter-coup implies that Mossadeq deposed the Shah first, which according to the ample scholarship cited in this article, is not what happened. 
It is of course possible that the concensus of scholarship on this issue is in error, but those who beleive this to be the case are by definition, holders of minority viewpoints. 
That said, I do think Shervink's views are interesting and should be included (and noted as a minority viewpoint) in the article. This issue is generally seen as the west vs. Iran with the shah on the side of the west. A point of view more sympathetic to the monarchy is rarely heard.  Itsafarce",0

 False Photograph 

What is written in the article is untrue. There was only ONE photograph taken of Baha'u'llah, not two. The one photograph taken is the one on that is on display in the archives in Haifa. I have seen this picture, and the picture shown on this website is neither the same picture, nor is it a picture of the same personage. The claims that this photograph is a photograph of Baha'u'llah are false. The person in this photograph bears no physical resemblance to the personage in the photograph on display in the archives. Their ages appear to be the same, so the dissimilarity in resemblence cannot be ascribed to age differences in the same person.
I'm going to correct the text on display claiming """"two pictures"""" were taken of this historical figure, and am going to remove the picture. Quite frankly, all this debate is quite ridicules. I respect the Baha'is right to respect the Manifestations of God by not portraying their images publically, but they seem a bit too defensive. THeir all worried about showing his picture publicaly, and this isnt even his picture. Apparently this picture has been distributed, even among Baha'is. These people havent even seen the picture in the archives. I cannot emphasize how different in appearance the two personages in the two photographs are. Why do you think they never show the archives picture online? Or never show the two photographs together? Because it would be obvious that one of them is a false picture.
Thank you.

To quote the Baha'i World Centre:
""""In one of His epistles, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of Bahá'u'lláh, wrote that two photographs of Bahá'u'lláh were taken, both in Adrianople, Turkey, each in a different pose.

"""== Tizoc Ceballos, Composer (b.1979) Los Angeles, Ca ==

 Biography 
Tizoc is a notable American Composer of New Musichttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_20th_century_classical_composers#1970s.  At a very early age he began studying piano, and in Middle School began taking trumpet lessons at the Los Angeles Music and Arts School. There he also began taking Mariachi lessons and by age 16 was fully immersed into the Mariachi world.  Today Tizoc is privileged to have had the opportunity to play along side of some of the most talented Mariachi musicians in the world and enjoys sharing his passion for Mariachi music through teaching and performing.

While completing his undergraduate work at Chapman University, through the support of professors and his wife, Tizoc realized a passion for writing music. Tizoc’s new found excitement for composition and new music led him to participate in Chapman’s New Music and Percussion Ensembles where he began learning percussion, and expanding his exposure to 21st century music. By his second year at Chapman, Tizoc gained admission into the composition program and began studying with composers Sean Heim and Shaun Naidoo. Compositionally, Tizoc is influenced by many different kinds of music, and aspires to use music as a medium to express some of our inner most emotions and states of mind.  His music has been performances by Chapman Universities Chamber Orchestra, New Music Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble as well as The California Ear Unit.

 Works 
Desidero Innocentia (2003) –Orchestra

Alone- Tenor and Piano

The Demon Within (2004) - Tape (electronic)
The Demon Within is a full electronic piece composed using sound samples processed through Adobe Audition. The piece centers on the idea of a person running from their demons. This piece is the story of the realization that our demons are a part of us, and inside us. They cannot be escaped.

Tu se Morta (2005) -Solo Cello and Tape
Composed for solo Cello and Tape, this piece is centered on Orfeo's reaction to learning that his love had died.  The main theme was derived from  theme found in the second recitative of Monteverdi's opera Orfeo.

This piece centers around feelings of insecurity, and fear.  The conductor takes the role as the person with self doubt.

Silent Cries (2006) -written for string ensemble
Program notes:
This piece was provoked by Mahmoud Ahmadunejad's absurd denial of the more then six million Jewish people murdered during the second world war.  Upon hearing his ridiculous denials I felt compelled to learn more about genocides around the world.  This research opened my eyes to the horror of well over 100 million innocent people exterminated due to hate and ignorance in genocides that took place throughout the modern world in the last hundred years.  The people murdered by the Nazi's in Europe during the second world war is not about numbers nor imagination, but sadly a fraction of the other genocides that took place worldwide in the 20th century, such as those in China, Japan, USSR, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Rwanda, Iraq, Aghanistan, Uganda, Bangladesh, Luberia, Sierra Leone, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Guatemala, Chad, Taiwan, Haiti, Spain, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Chile, and Argentina to name a few.

"The following policy is given in Wikipedia:Verifiability: ‘articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy’. On the other hand Wikipedia:No original research states ‘Examples of primary sources include... ...original philosophical works...’ and ‘Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation’ it also states at the end of the paragraph ‘Appropriate sourcing is a complicated issue, and these are general rules. The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’
The above enables me to derive some conclusions: 
What is mend by “third-party sources” (WP:V) is not exactly the same as “Tertiary sources” (NOR). If the policies do refer to the same they contradict each other, which probably is not the case. I think “third-party sources” are, placed in context, ‘other sources than Wikipedia itself and its editors’; this would make sense, given what follows directly after the line containing “third-party sources”: ‘Reliable sources are necessary [...] to substantiate material within articles...’
Vassyana said ‘Reliance on Rand directly is a NPOV concern...’ it is now clear that it is of no concern at all. Yes ‘an interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source’ but when the text of the citation speaks for itself no further interpretation is required. She also said ‘there is absolutely no need to rely heavily in any way on the primary material’ which is still argued, in contrast I say there is absolutely no reason not to rely heavily on the primary material.
The arguments pro primary source material have, as of yet, not been given a response; the focus was on the demand to have (mainly) third-party sources. In the proper context primary sources are third-party sources, fulfilling the demand. Again ‘The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’ Let’s now focus on that.",0

""":: Regarding the music on Levin's show...there are certain songs which he plays regularly, and might deserve some mention.  For instance, every Friday, close to the end of his show, he almost always (if not always) plays Ray Charles' version of """"America"""", and often times will play Martina McBride's version of """"God Bless America"""" as a tribute to some of his callers with military experience.  He also frequently plays the themes of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Merchant Marines.  

 If I was describing mere bumper music, I'd say it wasn't significant enough to merit a response.  But since there are several specific songs which are played regularly, often in their entirety, and contain common themes (pro-military, patriotic music), it's worth of inclusion.

 Is it also worth mentioning that he usually closes his show by giving a verbal salute to the men and women of the armed forces, policemen, fire-fighters, and first responders...at least I would think.  Any thoughts?

 transjordan, western palestine 

Hello Tewfik,  Here is how the text was before:
 Between July 1922 and 1948, the term Palestine referred to the British Mandate of Palestine. After the seperation of Transjordan, the term referred to Western Palestine,
First there is a contradiction, since the first sentence says that Palestine meant the full area of the Mandate (which included Transjordan) up to 1948 while the second says that it only meant the west part after the separation of Transjordan.  Second, the separation of Transjordan preceded the coming-into-legal-existence of the Mandate, so the time sequence is wrong.  Third, it seems confusing to say in effect """"Palestine meant Western Palestine"""" as if there is also another Palestine that isn't Palestine.  The facts as I understand them is that before the Mandate came into effect """"Palestine"""" was only informally defined, then as soon as the Mandate came into effect the British administration began to use Palestine to refer to the left bit and Transjordan to refer to the right bit.  talk """,0

Hi David, great explanation and thank you.
I acknowledge and accept your main points above.  My only argument is that the term """"British Isles"""" is being used as a substitute for a more accurate term.  If we substituted the word """"Europe"""", we would lose the point that this was the first anglican bishop to not swear allegiance to the British monarch on behalf of a """"province"""" outside the kindoms controlled by the British monarch (in enemy territory).  The scottish anglicans were still within the area (Kingdom of Great Britain).  As a note, the relevance is those two points taken together - not swearing allegiance *and* not being in an area controlled by the monarch.
BTW, what is the connection between the consecration of Samuel Seabury and the founding of the new province?  Is it assumed that the new province was recognized immediately?  If so, what is the relevance of representative clergy from nine dioceses meeting in Philadelphia to ratify the church's initial constitution in 1789?  Is this the actual official founding of the province?
If you are happy to substitute the term with kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland as a compromise, I am fine with that.    """,0

"Rajarata was abundant due to regular wars for the Rajarata land. Sinhalese kings tried to re established Rajarata, but they weren't allowed by Pandyan empire. They had full control of the Sri Lanka in 1450. They got real opportunity after 235 years from the Tamil invasion. That time people adjusted to wet zone so it is possible that descendants of the engineering families didn't had the practical knowledge to rebuild the dry zone hydraulic system. It wasn't that much simple. Even British couldn't understand how the system works. 
So clear major reason is they were adjusted to a another system. Also non existence of expert knowledge to rebuild the system could help to not to go to dry zone again.  But clearly it is not enviornmental issues. It was run more than 15 centuries.
I don't see Magha is irrelavant here. Magha doesn't mean only Magha. He couldn't do all the things alone. He was supported by his army.
Even king didn't had child army had children. Those are the people who came to Jaffna.   

 pre History of Jaffna kingdom 

Jaffna was part of Rajarata before the collapse of Rajarata. Some people trying to say there was independent kingdom (convergence) Jaffna. But how there can be a kingdom without people ? People came with Magha's army. So due to what it could survive from the power of Rajarata ?   

 Starting point of Rajarata 
Magha is not the one who established Jaffna kingdom. Magha is the last king of Rajarata. People accept Magha as king as they couldn't find any royal blood at that time and Magha was Nissanka Malla relative. Also sinhalese power was very weak at that time due to regular providing of strong armies to assist Pandyan to servile from Cholas. Due to this Veera Pandyan a Pandyan prince who get help from Sinhalese and couldn't servive chola powers invaded weak (unstable due to internal conflicts for kingship) Pollonnaruwa. Then Kalinga Magha (Sinha) invaded Rajarata with army of Tamils. There was a battle Magha defeated Veera Pandyan. Magha was accepted as the king. But it wasn't sure whether Magha was controlled by his army chiefs. Armies destroyed Buddhist stupas (may be to find treasures). Also there wasn't way to feed large number of army. Therefore they expelled Sinhalese from north.
People go against the king (as they did to Mahasen) and fight against king. Magha had to abandon the Rajarata. This army wasn't big as previous chola armies. Previous occasions Rajarata rulers completely expelled previous chola invaders and those who wished to join  king was also allowed ( vellakkara group). But Magha's army had good support from Pandyan (It is not clear why Pandyan betrayed Sinhalese as Sinhalese regularly provided armies to survive from Cholas). Pandyan was just near Jaffna and able to respond very quickly. After repulse of Sinhalese Magha's descenders had to accept they obey Pandyan King. Pandyan ruled/assist jaffna with military family called as Aryachakravarthi. But in 1323 powerful Muslim empire destroyed Pandyan capital and captured the king. After Pandyan was ruled by Muslims. They didn't care to assist Jaffna. At this point Aryachkravarthi him self made as the king of Jaffna. 
It is not right to say Magha as the establisher of Jaffna kingdom. He was the king of Pollonnaruwa but after his death and tamil forces was expelled from Rajarata core areas to Jaffna they were under protection of the Pandyan king. So Arachakravarthi established the Jaffna Kingdom",0

"Pesher theory, Satanic Attack or Religion Novice
One could interpret Dr Thiering's pesher theory as a Satanic attack
to discredit deity in religion... at best. Or one could simply chalk
it down to a novice babbling away.

From St Augustine through 1,000s of saints and experts, deeper understanding
reveals divinity to be real, including that of Jesus and heaven, etc.

The final proof then will be in the Second Coming which pesher theory would
equate to only a human being who is a larger teacher of mankind; but when
Christ comes again shortly and creates endless miracles, as healing across
the entire face of the earth, such tripe as pesher will be seen to be 
what it is, babble, from someone who has no depth of understanding of

"""Thank you Joseph2302. I'll be very sincere with you. I have been a full time article writer, blogger and web content writer. I also earn a living from that. I work on freelancer.com, Elance.com and odesk.com..  

Here's my public profile on freelancer.com   -   https://www.freelancer.com/u/hilumeoka2000.html

Here's my public profile on Elance.com  -   https://www.elance.com/s/hilumeoka2000/

You can also search """"hilumeoka2000"""" in Odesk to get my details there.

Now, I use to see  clients post jobs about """"Write a Wikipedia page""""  or """"Create a Wikipedia page"""" on all the freelancer platforms. In fact, it seems as if everyone wants to be on wikipedia probably because of the high page ranking and traffic that comes from the resource. 

As a freelancer interested in research, I use to get useful materials from Wikipedia and other sources to write some of my articles.  Indeed, Wikipedia has been a great resource.

Sometime in 2002, I created an account on wikipedia to see if I can meet the demands of the clients who request for wiki job on freelance platforms. To be frank, I didn't understand how to use wikipedia as at then. Hence, I abandoned the urge to write wikipedia articles and continued with my normal web content development and article writing career.

Now, sometime in April this year, I decided to start placing bids on wikipedia jobs via freelancer.com.  This is because, wiki jobs are always available but there are few people who actually know how to write them.

I made a decision to learn about wikipedia writing and what it entails. I started reading all the wiki tutorials I could see on wikipedia.  I started learning and indeed, it's quite interesting.  It was not easy initially, but, I vowed to know more.

So, I placed my first bid  on freelancer.com. A client wanted me to write on """"Joshua Letcher"""" . I accepted. I used this particular topic to learn some facts about wiki policies.  I created and submitted it for review. It was rejected but I was told what to do to make it acceptable. I took some days to make some researches about """"Joshua Letcher"""" I discovered, there are no media secondary resources.. That was the reason the article was deleted.

Now, the same client also contracted me to write about thier company """"Newfield Resources Ltd. I did my research to get some secondary resources. I succeeded and created the article. It was allowed to stay.

So, I got excited. I really became very happy that I can now write wikipedia articles. So, I went for more.  I always focused more on maintaining neutrality and using secondary sources. I also follow the rules on referencing and formatting having taken enough time to learn them.

Now, as a freelancer, I kept getting alerts about new Wikipedia  creation jobs. I  go ahead to place my bids.  I really got selected by some clients to help them put up a wikipedia page.  I also get paid for doing so as a freelancer. I turn down jobs that do not have media coverage or jobs that are meant to promote or advertise since they are against wiki rules.

So far, I've created the following pages via the jobs I won through freelancer.com and Elance.com. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Direct

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Kumar_Kalotee 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfield_Resources_Limited 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_Concern_Welfare_Society

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawano_Kambeu

I made sure each of the pages is  neutral and properly cited. I'm also working on few more pages right now. I don't get involved in vandalism or supporting stands to make a page stay on wikipedia. My main focus is to create new pages.

To be very sincere with you, I've never heard about the issue of disclosing paid identity on Wikipedia until now. I thought that I'm free to create articles as a freelancer and get paid.

I noticed one thing about most of my clients. They don't know how to create articles on wikipedia. Some of them have tried but failed. Hence, they look for an expert who will help them.

So please, I'll like to know if I'm contravening wiki rules by creating articles for clients through freelancer.com.  I don't really know. There are lots of policies on wikipedia. I learn most of them as I create articles. I learn virtually on daily basis. 

Do I need to declare myself as a Paid editor or something?  Do I need to stop creating articles for clients? 

I'll like to get clarifications.

I resent the implication, being the webmaster of the aforementioned site.  The site is not a """"Wacky Website"""", but a factually accurate record, with comments tossed in.  You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!

UncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of """"unsigned"""" motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.

The Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the """"parent"""" motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.

As is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short """"spur"""" motorway actually links two different motorways.

If it is part of the M65, as the """"start of restrictions"""" sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state """"M61 (M65)"""", meaning a part of the M61?  This is a common form of signage throughout the UK system, but is unusual to be found upon a motorway.  

A similar item can be seen with reference to the example of the A635(M) above, the """"start of restrictions"""" sign when heading westbound on the A635(M) clearly states """"A57(M)"""", but the DfT documentation states otherwise. (it's the """"Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 3266 The City of Manchester (Mancunian Way A635(M) and A57(M) Mancunian Way Slip Roads) Special Road Scheme 1992 Confirmation Instrument 1995"""" that you're looking for if you're really concerned about its accuracy.  A PDF copy is available on Pathetic Motorways, but a simple Google search will turn up the relevant central government pages if you doubt the source material).

The Walton Summit Motorway is a motorway without a number, hardly an unusual concept in road terms, where most roads either do not possess a classification number, or is of a """"C"""", """"D"""" or """"U"""" classification, which do not appear on road signs.  It is, bowever, an unusual concept in motorway terms.""",0

Bigfoot

Welcome back. Like the Devil and Daniel Webster. True, the intro is a mess and it must be made clear that Bigfoot is not a proven zoological species, but is tentative, and unproven. But the search goes on for evidence. The extreme LENGTH of this search leads researchers, with or without PhDs, to speculate that there may be a""""Plan C"""" where the beings may be neither hoax, (too many sighitngs for that) nor zoological (no body) but instead may be a theoretical space-time creature. This has not yet been stated. It needs to be. Skeptical editors can relax and know that skeptics are correct, there is no zoological Bigfoot nor Yeti. But there is something else. This is being ignored and swept under the rug. Always remember that with no official funding, """"mainstream"""" science has no positive opinion on the topic, and the work goes on by unpaid PhDs and many amateurs, and one paid non-academic.

Request topic ban of User:Novaseminary for persistent disruptive editing at Douglas Tait (stuntman)
 
User:Novaseminary has tried unsuccessfully to get the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP deleted twice before. Here, and here. But having failed at deletion twice, for two years now, Novaseminary has also failed at WP:LETITGO. He persistently challenges the BLP's notability and threatens to start a 3rd deletion attempt. He also regularly violates WP:DE. He edit wars and disruptively edits almost on a daily basis, pushes POV, attacks other articles because they are mentioned in the BLP, creates suspect disambig stubs, insists on irrelevant or dated edits, violates OR, uses citation tags to edit war, like here, here, here and here, removes sourced quotes and attacks and fights to include and spreads unflattering and irrelevant material about the BLP's subject over several editor's objections.
 
But Novaseminary is also knowledgeable of WP rules. So knowledgeable that he uses WP to argue & defend his indefensible actions, even as he ignores all the WP rules & policies that his tendentious editing violates. He cites the rules that give him cover, and just ignores those that expose his tactics as disruptive. Recommend an immediate topic ban. Not just for the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP, but for all the articles sourced in the BLP. Otherwise he will just retaliate by continuing to disrupt them. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) 
 This looks like a content dispute. Have you taken this to WP:DRN as a first port of call? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 
Unfortunately, it's more than a content issue. It's a persistent, long-term pattern of disruptive behavior. So per WP:DDE, ANI """"may be the best first step."""" 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) 
The article would probably benefit from both these editors leaving it alone. Drmies (talk)

I found this at WP:RFPP and have spent more time than I'm willing to admit looking through it all. 3RR violations from dynampic IPs are really disruptive, but similarly I think we can do without Noveseminary's bizarre obsession with this person. I'm going to give Novaseminary time to respond, but I strongly lean towards a topic ban for both users. – Steel 
 You know what? I'll accept that. If Novaseminary is topic banned, I'll voluntarily self-ban. My only request is that the last edit before the ban is monitored/reviewed by uninvolved 3rd party/parties to insure no Novaseminary POV. Thanks. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk) 
I've never violated a single guideline or policy at this article. The IP seems to care more about how this person is presented favorably than about the nietrality of WP, but it tough to know what else if anything this IP has edited. This article was one of several resume-like PR/POV articles i've come across over the years. I, and others, tried to make it neutral and then kept it on my watchlist. Almost everything i've done i've discussed at talk. I have only even edited this over the last few weeks because an IP came along and removed well sourced text without discussion until posted at a NB. Novaseminary (talk) 
I would also point out, I only nominated this article for deletion once, with no consensus. I actually came across it at the first successful AfD nom made, not by me, but another editor. The IP seems to think I have had it out for this person, but I have been only one of several editors to do things the IP apparently disapproves of, but that I think comply with policy. (At one point the article cited several non-RS articles written by a single publicist, for instance.) Novaseminary (talk) 
Our IP user has agreed to a self-ban from this article providing you do the same. From your comments above that the IP's edits are the only reason you've even been editing the page recently, this should be an acceptable resolution for you too. Right? – Steel  Yes. Novaseminary?

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"""" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

Wow, that was quick.

I had been in the midst of composing the following reponse.

Thank you for the magnanimity in overlooking my latter comments, AGK, you're too kind.
First of all, though it is true that I learned that NYB is an attorney from Wikipediocracy, there are no entries in relation to you on that website, as a simple search via their search engine would have indicated had you taken the time to check, as a courtesy .
The fact of the matter is, I learned about your status as an undergraduate studying law from your own User page Hi, I'm Anthony, an undergraduate and Wikipedia contributor from Scotland. where you make it a point to make it prominent that you are:
an undergraduate
studying law
from Scotland
Well, good for you. Maybe someday you'll even become an attorney, after you graduate from college, and maybe pass a bar exam, that is. 
Now, the edit summary of that diff of your eliminating that information from your User page is sort of interesting(off-wiki stuff probably isn't interesting to most people)
And what is even more interesting, is that it occurred on August 24, just after you'd posted fallacious FoF about me and voted to indefinitely topic-ban me from the Tea Party movement article. 
Why is it, do you suppose, that I, for one, would not be interested in such information about you?
Clearly there is a question as to your WP:Competence, as far as I'm concerned, but I will defer to Jimbo Wales on that point for our purposes here, as you are undoubtedly aware that there is an appeal of the decision you are heavily implicated in on his Talk page. 
At any rate, I have to get some sleep now, so I will simply ask reviewing admins to visit Jimbo's Talk page and follow the links. I've linked to you Talk page there as well. 
As far as I'm concerned, and I have stated this on the Tea Party movement PD Talk page, WP:SPADE is the operative policy here.
I've merely repeated information you'd posted long ago on your User page and recently deletedfor whatever private reasons.
Clearly I disagree with your FoF and decisions, and question your WP:COMPETENCE to serve on ARBCOM in light of the unjust actions you have take against me.

"And there is your main problem. Your edited a page for a band you don't now a thing about. It's would be like me edited a the page about Jazz music or Kenny G. I don't know a thing about it and I don't care how many reliable sources I have how do I check to know they are even telling the truth if I don't even listen to Jazz or Kenny G who plays Smooth jazz. I leave it to people who know about that music and know about Kenny G. 

Another example I have never watched The O.C. but should I edit it to say it's a sci-fi show just because some reliable sources says it is? That's giving false info on something I don't know a thing about. I do know about One Tree Hill (TV series) and I will edit out  any one that would try to list it as a sci-fi show even if a reliable sources wants to say other wise. Why because ever one who has watched the show knows it's a Teen Drama and ever one agrees on that. 

Your a bands whole page when you don't even listen to the band and only know what someone else told you about them. I watch One Tree Hill I have all four senses on DVD I know a lot about the show I can edit it because I know what I'm talking about. I can't do the same with The O.C., Jazz music or the page about Kenney G no matter what reliable sources because I have know why of knowing if those sources are stating facts about the subject at hand.

Edits in history of the tank

A while back you added some considerable information to the section /*Between the Wars*/, which was more in its place in the Tanks (1919-1939) article. I've moved/merged this information into the latter article and would appreciate it if you could look over both articles to see if nothing has been lost or inadvertely been duplicated?  

 Thanks, I made a few edits to it. I also removed a few small items that were correct, but not 'between the wars' info.

 This and that 

Firstly, I edited a chapter of my Meltyukhov translation a couple of days ago, but lamentably after my last save the Word annaounced that the file was 'corrupt'. Problems emerged while I was trying to send it via mail, as the copy of text I tried to add from recovered version of this 'corrupt' file was declared to 'contain no data'. The same thing occured, as I tried to post the whole text into my wikipage. I don't know what to do about it, I actually need this text for preparing an article in wikipedia as well (rough notes on my page) .

Secondly, (another unpleasant news) 'our mutual friend' Deng has become active again! See his changes to WW2 Eastern front proposal page. 

(Is it necessary to add, that he is obviously trying to revive the old story of 'bad Germanns and goodd Soviets'? He replaced a paragraph on Vlasov etc with his version of the events (a rather belletristic 'improvement', BTW), and usual English with his understanding of the English grammar...)  - Talk 

There is currently a debate going on in Eastern front talk page, whether to use the current proposed page and unlock. I suggest you express your opinion there.  - Talk

Assault guns were easier, cheaper and less time consuming to produce than turreted tanks and that is why German factories built them in large numbers.

"""4. This last summary is partly from chapters two, three, and four in Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W. (1997). Children communicating: the first 5 years. Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. 
The main idea for chapter two, Nonverbal communication: its origins and development, is the awareness of events around the child such as gaze and gesture interaction, facial expressions, and modifying emotional expressiveness. """"With age, children's encoding (sending messages) and decoding (interpreting messages) skills increase. Yet children are better at decoding than at encoding, a fact suggesting that nonverbal comprehension precedes production"""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 35). This fact represents interpersonal communication and how it improves with age in children. 
The main point for chapter three, The development of language, is the social development based on the environment of the child. """"Children's nonverbal communication skills, especially those developed through interactional synchrony with adult caretakers, foreshadow the conversational exchanges that typify interpersonal communication."""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 57) Good interpersonal communication starts from the beginning with infant communication, mainly nonverbal, and so it translates to the developmental skills to attain high levels of communication. This chapter also touches on stages in language development which is a slight alternative idea to explain parts of interpersonal developmental process. The stages include prelinguistic development, speech perception/production, semantic development, private speech, and first words. 
Also, the main idea for chapter four, Developing verbal communication and how its relevant in children's acquisition of a variety of communicative strategies for attaining goals. A main focus is """"discussing the communicative intentionally substage of development"""" for infants """"emerging abilities to control their communicative skills"""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 105). All three chapters contribute to a more concise understanding of language how it contributes to the ideas of interpersonal communication development in young children.

The population of southern speakers is barely a minority, I'd hate to be from Louisiana and hear some egomaniac from Iowa talk about his accent being the right one. It's like the woman who says the toilet seat should be down, even though 50% of the population uses it the other way, she thinks her way is the right way. Newscasters generally speak with a northern accent, I can attest to that, but they come from all over, and how many of them are deliberately trained to speak like a Midwesterner? I can't imagine such a thing. Would a newscaster from Albany NY or Seattle, or LA, or Connecticut, where people all have basically the standarn northern accent, need to change to some sort of cornfield Nebraska twang? Hell no. The Midwestern accent is not really typical anyway, I lived in Michigan for a year and people have an unusual accent there, not the typical newscaster accent. They say everything is """"the bomb,"""" but they pronounce bomb as if it were spelled """"bahm."""" Their accent may be the bahm, but is NOT the standard way to pronounce things in journalism. I would say that of all the places in the USA that have the most neutral speach, that journalists would try to emulate, this region where I live beats out the Midwest for neutrality. Eastern upstate NY, from Poughkeepsie to Syracuse. Also Connecticut, they hae no trace of the New England weirdness that you see in Vermont or Maine, or most of Mass. And northwestern Mass has the Vermont accent. Very little of Mass is free of the weird New England thing. Worchester, forget it...very thick there. Probably the only accent-free part of Mass. is around Springfield, or southwestern Mass in general. That's like Connecticut, which is neutral. The Vermont accent is only found among the older people. Young kids in Vermont are not carrying this on at all. The old timers with their """"Pepperidge Faam Remembas"""" accent with all the """"ayaah,"""" well that was a Swedish accent and the grandchildren of the Swedes don't talk that way anymore. Not at all. As for the NYC accent, that only goes as far north as Peekskill unless you count all the transplanted NYC folks, especially after September 11, who moved upstate by the millions lately. As far north as Poughkeepsie, there are a good number of NYC folks that moved up, but the native Poughkeepsie people have the basic American accent, and the children of the NYC folks lose their accent in one generation. North or west of Albany, there are very few NYC transplants and no accent at all, except for the rednecks. And what can you do about the rednecks?  """,0

The first section is a standard greeting, its friendly and it may contain some information that is useful to you. As you will see these messages will flag either on your email and/or at the top of the page next time you log in. Editor to editor messages not about a specific page are usually done this way.

To answer you question. I put ticks to show how we can join the dots but can only do it through reliable sources if you are not sure is something is a reliable source you can always ask at WP:RSN (reliable sources noticeboard).

Perhaps an example of what you can do with your sources is the easiest way to go. In my sandboxes|sanbox]] I am many others developing an article on  one of the players in that was a man called Francis Windebank (Royalist soldier) as Wikpedia had no article on him, I created one based on the text in the Dictionary of National Biography for his father  see Wikisource:Windebank, Francis (DNB00). To do this I had to extract the article from an OCR version that is kept on Wikisource and put place it where it is now. So having put in the work to extract the article about his father I added said information to his more famous father's article Francis Windebank  With me so far? (BTW. We can copy copyright expired text strait into an article. The dos and don't are explained in the guideline WP:PLAGIARISM).
 
So when I expanded the Francis Windebank article it included the line """"Two others (daughters) became nuns of the Calvary at the Marais du Temple, Paris"""". Marais du Temple was a red-link, so I went on line and discovered that there was little in English on it but there was a French Wikipedia article so I copied and translated the lead from the French article and created Temple du Marais as a stub, unfortunately it still does not have citations, but from the pictures it clearly exists so it has not been put up for deletion. But in creating that article another red link was created Michel Villedo. So I created a stub for that. In that case it was much easier to source because there are reliable English language sources for the man.

So as you can see, one can use an article like minor campaigns of 1815 which has the potential to spark a whole level of creativity with missing biographies. It was your edit to the article that prompted me to look up detail on Charles Auguste Creutzer, and as I found enough I created the stub Charles Auguste Creutzer. But that still leave open the question """"how do you know that Siborne was referring to Charles Auguste Creutzer when he wrote General Kreutzer and not some other General Kreutzer? What is your source for saying he was the commandant of the Fortress of Bitsch?"""". As soon as a source can be found that say that we can modify the text or create an redirect

As to where to put your findings. Do you have a tab next to talk called [Sandbox] if so it should link to  I have about a score, including 3 sandboxes of which the contents of  and a  may interest you, as yet you  have none.

There are still many fundamental problems with the string theory and its successors (M-theory etc.). I mention just three problems which a good Theory of Everything (TOE) should solve:

1. A good TOE should be able to formulate its own principles and fundamental equations. Moreover, these principles and equations should clarify and simplify our picture of the physical world and allow some testable predictions. As far as I know, nothing like that is still available for the string theory (M-theory), in contrast to its rather long development and far-reaching claims. 

2. A good TOE should allow  calculations of all interaction constants and particle parameters from its fundamental principles. It was actually one of the original Einstein's goals - to give some purely geometrical or mathematical origin to fundamental physical constants. No variant of string theory is able to calculate these parameters from some first principles.

3. If the TOE is formulated in some space of higher dimension (11, etc.), as expected, there should be also a unique and justified principle of compactification - e.g., a principle how to project the structures from the 11-dim world to our tangible 4-dim world. In its contemporary status, (super)string theory is very fuzzy and umbiguous concerning the compactification.

 
In my opinion, the very word """"theory"""" is rather premature in connection with the (super)string theory and Einstein himself probably would not be very happy with its present form and claims.  """,0

"The 'arguments' above consist of reiteration. I also disagree that there are significant differences between anime and animation; certainly the latter covers a far wider stylistic range and anime could be described as a subset derived from the development of particular forms of mass production (which are also found in animation from other countries, whether the USA, Korea, or anywhere else making significant amounts for the mass market); this definition would exclude Miyazaki (who, indeed, excludes himself, unlike his western fans). Likewise men in monster suits and miniature work are hardly unique to a particular national tradition. Yes, the Ultraman tradition represents as much of a speciality as Marvel/DC superheroes, and certainly deserves a specific article, but this is not the same as Tokusatu.

 You People... 
...Are hoping, begging and wishing for previlages, respect a title that you did not earn, go by on your own and are not deserving of.  You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.

Once the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.

If you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.

All of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask """"if they can be white, then why should I not be?""""  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  

Sadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.

I still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.

Also, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning """"your type of whites as opposed to my type"""" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.  It is",0

 About the topic ban of Wilhelmina Will from DYK 

I've been trying to figure out what happened with the AN/I report that led to a topic ban for WW. Normally, when the community makes a decision that requires admin tools to implement or enforce, there is a closing administrator. I've reviewed the report and have summarized it at User:Abd/Will ANI incident (at this point, this is a long summary, not a short one, I will prepare a short version if it's later needed.) And I just realized that there never was a close to that report, which explains why WW wasn't informed, that would normally be a task undertaken by a closing admin. Now, you later described the report as a consensus to topic ban, and you did inform WW, but you reported it passively, as if it had not been your decision, you were just the messenger.

I easily understand how it happened, and assume nothing but good faith on your part, but there was a fundamental error here. The community does not make decisions by vote. Rather, it uses agents, public servants, who make decisions after review of community comment, but the servants are responsible for reviewing the arguments, and vote count isn't the issue except as a very rough guide, and I've seen many decisions, made by highly competent administrators, which ran directly contrary to a large majority of votes, based on a review of the arguments.

So I'm asking you if you did this. Did you review the arguments and decide that they were cogent and that a topic ban was in the best interests of the project. If you did not, would you do so now and """"close,"""" i.e., take personal responsibility for the decision? In which case you could then inform us as to the length of the ban, or any other conditions imposed. And there would then be, if another administrator wishes to lift the ban, a responsible admin to contact?

I will tell you that my now much more detailed review of the facts leads me to the conclusion that a ban wasn't justified at all, there was no disruption at DYK from Wilhelmina Will, and there was very minor misbehavior elsewhere which only gets connected with DYK because of her presumed motive. A general conclusion from those who understand DYK seems to be that there is nothing wrong with the motive, and that what WW did was simply some minor foolishness, of a kind that would normally pass almost unnoticed, and which she has not continued. So, in spite of her seeming disregard of warnings, she clearly hasn't disregarded them, she just quietly complied. Yes, she should learn to respond, it would help. But I have never seen a response to a warning as being a condition for not blocking. The procedure is Warn. Wait for repeated offense. Block if repeated. Not Warn. Wait for promise to comply. Block if no promise.

There were several issues raised:
Mesodermchelys misbehavior: short term, over one or two days, 2 improper reverts to preserve word count. 3 edit summaries that express her personal reaction to Blechnic  which, after reviewing what he had done, I fully understand and sympathize with. She was foolish to make those edit summaries, but it wasn't disruptive, and it wasn't personal attack within the meaning given at WP:NPA, whereas she was under repeated PA within that meaning: an attempt to damage her reputation.
Copyright violations. Evidence was requested at ANI, but none was provided, links were given by Blechnic that showed nothing of the kind. He is now attempting to build a case on his Talk page  he now refers to all of her edits as crap, later amended to vandalism  and what he cited was a sentence in a seven-month-old article which, it turns out, she had noticed in the Sandbox and asked an admin if she could use it, and she failed to check for copyvio.

Incivility. But the example given, as far as I recall, was always back to the Mesodermochelys incident. And then reference was made to her lying about it, claiming that her leetspeak comment was really a note to herself about something else. This was a clumsy excuse that simply shows that she is naive. And which was harmless, except to her own reputation.
Accuracy of her articles. She has made mistakes. However, what I've seen with WW articles on scientific subjects is that, particularly if they are DYK nominated, whatever errors are in them are rapidly fixed. The articles aren't an obstacle to the creation of accurate content, rather they facilitate it, particularly by being DYK nominated. In other words, if there is, in fact, a problem here, DYK is part of the solution, not part of the problem. But, in fact, her articles are much better than the average new article on Wikipedia.

"VOTE NOW! Should Peggy Mitchell be on the Fictional erotic dancers category. 

It has been revealed during Peggy's political campaign that she was a pole dancer for the '60s gangland.  Everyone in Walford found out about this part of her past and Peggy gradually became open towards it and used it in her speech at The Vic.

 Criticism Section - Not Clutch 

This section is basically about how Arod is not considered to be clutch. The section is outdated and irrelevant due to his performance in the 2009 playoffs. No one debates whether or not he is clutch anymore. This entire section should be deleted. Does anyone disagree?  — (talk • contribs)  
I'm thinking about this.  Some of it could be kept, if put in a historical perspective.  But it is clearly over the top as it is.   
I just reread this section, and it's completely outdated. I still think it should be removed in it's entirety.   
Some of it needs to be kept.  Let's discuss what should stay and what should go.  I'm totally okay with reducing the size of it, but it needs to be mentioned.   
I made some dramatic changes to the section, trying to shorten it and update it.  Also, I've tried to reorganize the section as it had obviously grown organically over a long period.  My efforts are by no means stellar, and I suggest people look at the section with new eyes to see how to further improve it.  
It is, at the least, a good start.  Thank you.  I'll take a closer look at it later.   
Nice updates. The section seems relevant again.   
I made some minor copyedits to the section. I think the section ought to stay included  it's part of Arod's historical record that he's come under fire for being """"un-clutch"""" (ludicrous as those criticisms may have been). I'm also going to remove the tag suggesting integrating the section elsewhere  the section hardly gives undue weight to the controversy, which extended over a period of several years and occupied who-knows-how-many back pages in the sports press. bomb 

 Range Factor 

The range factor claims currently tagged as as """"citation needed"""" can be verified on ESPN's page (and probably elsewhere). The claims as stated are accurate and verifiable. I'd add the cite, but on second thought I question whether it's really a useful thing to state. It makes it sound like that's the final word on his defense, which it surely isn't. Range factor isn't the only defensive stat, and A-Rod does not rank last on many of the others. To cite it exclusively feels like you're trying to push a point of view criticizing him defensively. (Also, even on range factor, in 2004 and 2005 he was tied for last, not alone.)   

 """"Youngest to hit 600"""" 

This stat is misleading, while he may be the youngest to achieve this he took an above average time to do so. He played 183 more games than Babe Ruth. Because Rodriguez started playing baseball at a much earlier age than many of the greats should be noted. He is a good player, but statements concerning his age should be taken out. Games played/Seasons are a better barometer of talent than age.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 170.123.4.230

 WP:FILM coordinator 

Hey, I saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for WP:FILM concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more.

I questioned if somehow anti-Semitic rants were an exception to this rule, since I was being told I was somehow impinging upon the anti-Semtic editor's rights and free speech. I still question that.

Kurdistan is not a geo-political region. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iraq. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iran. There's no region called Kurdistan in Turkey.

Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/J. Francis Hitching

On the above page for J. Francis Hitching a user claims there are no reliable sources for Hitching so the article should be deleted. Let's now have a real look for real references which nobody will bother to look at, sadly i am blocked for 1 week but let's have a look here at what i found in the space of 10 minutes (i bothered to look):

1. Review of Hitching's book New Scientist Nov 10, 1977

2. Detailed review of Hitching's book """"Earth Magic""""

3. Bernard Heuvel quoting Hitching in his book """"The Mysteries""""

4. A detailed review of one of Hitching's books in the NewScientist magazine

5. Hitching's book mentioned by David Livingstone

6. Hitching is referenced in a further 20 books

7. Hitching's book quoted by Christopher H. K. Persaud

8. A detailed review of Hitching's book and evolutionary theory

Hitching wrote 4 well known books, he is not a """"fringe"""" or """"crackpot"""" author. Further references can also be found. For example Hitching is also mentioned in some papers published by the Society for Psychical Research which can be found online.

Cleary people are not even looking for references. Are their eyes shut or are they just not looking? More evidence of the non-neutral side of things going on here, please can an admin take a look? Also to point out if the Hitching article is deleted - I will have to create it when i am unblocked, becuase as you can see there are MANY third party references for Hitching and his work, please upload what i have written here to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/J.

 The Commanders Box 
I looked over the article about 2-3 weeks ago and noticed that the only French commmander listed was Napoleon and a French admiral of low worth; that was ridiculous so I added some commanders on the French side.

But my mission was accomplished (getting French and other Napoleonic state's commanders listed)!

I like the changes that were made recently. However, ironically now, I think there are too many French commanders listed.

Randal """"Randy"""" Keith Orton[4][5] (born on April 1, 1980)[2] is an American professional wrestler currently signed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) wrestling on its Raw brand.[6] Orton is a third-generation professional wrestler; his grandfather Bob Orton, Sr., father """"Cowboy"""" Bob Orton, as well as his uncle Barry O, all competed in the professional wrestling industry.[7]

Before being promoted to the main WWE roster, Orton trained in and wrestled for Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling for a month. He was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). There, Orton became OVW Hardcore Champion on two separate occasions.[8]

After signing with WWE, Orton became a member of the stable Evolution, which quickly led to him capturing his first title with the company.[9] Orton also acquired the moniker """"Legend Killer"""" during a storyline where he began disrespecting Hall of Famers and physically attacking veterans of professional wrestling outside of appropriate restrictions.[1] In 2004, Orton became the youngest World Heavyweight Champion, when he won the title at the age of twenty-four.[10] His title win resulted in his departure from Evolution and feud with his former stablemates. In 2006, Orton joined forces with Edge in a tag team known as Rated-RKO. As a team, Orton and Edge held the World Tag Team Championship.[11] After the team disbanded, Orton, during the fall of 2007, won the WWE Championship twice in one night.[6]

Early life
Orton was born on April 1, 1980 in Knoxville, Tennessee.[2] Son to Elaine and """"Cowboy"""" Bob Orton,[12] he is the eldest of two siblings—Becky and Nathan.[13] Knowing from experience the hardships of life as a professional wrestler, Orton's parents tried to convince him to stay away from wrestling, and his father warned him that life in the ring meant a life on the road, away from family.[1] Orton attended Hazelwood Central High School, where he was an amateur wrestler.[1] After graduating from Hazelwood in 1998,[5] Orton enlisted with the United States Marine Corps. There, he was dishonorably discharged a year later, after going AWOL on two separate occasions and disobeying an order from a commanding officer.[14] Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Private First Class Orton was tried and convicted under a special court-martial and was put into a military prison for thirty-eight days.[12]

Career

Wrestling training
Orton first made his professional wrestling debut in 2000 with Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling (MMWA-SICW) in St. Louis, Missouri, an organization that was an off-shoot of the old St. Louis Wrestling Club headed by Sam Muchnick.[3] There, he was trained by both the promotion and his father, Cowboy Bob Orton.[12] During this time, Orton performed in matches with wrestlers such as Ace Strange and Mark Bland.[3][15] He worked at MMWA-SICW for a month.[15] Orton then refereed a few matches with World Organized Wrestling, a promotion where his uncle Barry Orton worked.[16] In 2001, Orton signed a deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was sent to their farm territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued his training. During his time in OVW, Orton wrestled the likes of Rico Constantino and The Prototype and teamed with Bobby Eaton during a tag team title tournament. He won the OVW Hardcore Champion on two separate occasions by defeating Mr. Black on February 14, 2001 and Flash Flanagan on May 5, 2001.[8]

 Dates and Wellhausen 

I think this edit  by  should be pulled, at least pending further consideration:

It must be noted that Wellhausen's knowledge of Jewish literature outside of the Bible was limited, and led to his considerable confusion in event chronologies and dating. Notably he supposed the receiving of Torah was dating from about 1450 BCE, and that of monarchy, established by Saul, c.1020 BCE, and the (later) prophets, 9th to 5th centuries BCE.[ Julius Wellhausen ] In the case of the first the date in Jewish chronology is established as 1313 BCE, Saul is dated to 879 BCE, and Isaiah during 619 BCE. [pp.33,47,53, Kantor]

These dates are based on Seder Olam Rabbah.  But a literalist reading of that book would give the destruction of the Temple in 423 BCE   way after the accepted dates for eg the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) or Xerxes' invasion of Greece (480 BC); so a wholesale new chronology for the entire history of Classical Greece would have to be found  which nobody seriously believes is credible.  (See Missing years (Hebrew calendar).

So people who use the Seder Olam Rabbah dates (though not eg chabad.org ) generally adjust them to make the destruction of the temple match its date in the Babylonian records, viz. 586 BCE.  

Adding that shift to Kantor's dates gives 1476 BCE for the Exodus, 1043 BCE for Saul, and 782 BCE for Isaiah (compare Chronology of the Bible).  Modern views tend to revise the numbers down very slightly (see eg Kingdom of Judah).  So Wellhausen's dates still match contemporary scholarship pretty much exactly.

Furthermore, what is important for Wellhausen's history is the relative dates of these events.  Even if one prefers not to add the absolute date shift, it makes no difference to the relative chronology of the events, and the relative dates between them.

I don't think therefore that this can be seen as a substantive objection to Wellhausen.    

I'm not sure I have ever seen Wellhousen mentioned to have been familiar with Seder Olam.
You seem to be well versed, so I need not explain to you how Greek chronology is rather problematic in itself.
What modern academics do with dates to support their individual hypothesis about record keeping in various ancient cultures is of course their province, but this particular subject, if it is to be consistent, can not be """"adjusted"""" to match sources outside of its innate culture, or time, never mind that many academics who postulate the chronologies you suggest are neither Jewish, nor even monotheistic. 
I note that the Missing years (Hebrew calendar) completely lacks citations, so its hard to say who and how argues for """"the modern secular dating"""". In any case, I will make sure to include a link to that article and will try to fix the citations in it.
Chronology of the Bible article, besides being likewise poorly cited, has four other templates at the top {{confusing|date=June 2008}}{{disputed|date=June 2008}}{{refimprove|date=June 2008}}{{totally-disputed|date=June 2008}}{{Cleanup|date=April 2007}} however, I will get to that also eventually. 
This article is about the Torah. Textual criticism is really not the place for it given the volumes of published works on the subject, so I'd like to keep that short. My point with the dates was to illustrate that not all 19th century theories about the Torah were well founded.Meieimatai 

The dates need not be """"scholarly"""". They come from a source consistent with the method by which chronology has been established within the culture for which this text is held as the core source of social construct. I'd say that it has every right to adopt whatever dating it desires for its purposes. Lack of faith by the academic textual analysts is not required, however, deletion of what constitutes cultural me",0

 Requests for comment 

 RFC/discussion of article Global warming controversy 
Hello, . As a prominent contributor to Global warming controversy, you may want to be aware that a request for comments has been filed about it. The RFC can be found by the article's name in this list, and the actual discussion can be found on Talk:Global warming controversy, in case you wish to participate. Thank you for your contributions.      
Controversy or not
Reading the article about the existence of a """"controversy"""" seems that there is not any controversy at all and instead the few not supporting human-causation in rising temperatures are outliers.

If this is the case the article seems to be unnecessary entirely.  If it is not the case then the article's balance is not to Wikipedia's standards.

Dual philosophies used in enforcement of policies, guidelines and content.
Questions seem to persists relating to the validity of sources.  On one hand sources that are not in agreement with the """"global warming conseneus"""" viewpoint are removed with the related text.  On the other hand sources that are in agreement with the """"global warming consensus"""" viewpoint are replaced.

Questions persists relating to the Wikipedia standards for handling edits.
When edits are made that are about one side of the Global Warming Controversy they are deleted or reverted with little, if any explanation.  When edits are made about the other side of the Global Warming Controversy there are attempts to """"make them better"""" instead of deletions. """,0

 Incorrect translation of quotations and improper combination of quotations from source 

In the discussion of the Pope's positions on poverty and inequality, there is an overly literal and incorrect translation of a quote from La Nación. When interpreting or translating, the goal is to accurately convey meaning and ideas, not words, from the source language to the target language. Also, the Wikipedia entry takes from the La Nación article two different quotes and combines them as if they were a single quote. It is inappropriate to treat exact quotations in such a manner. The discussion of the Pope´s comments about the poor should be re-written as follows: During a May 2010 speech in Argentina regarding the poor, he chastised """"the comfortable"""" whom """"avoided considering""""  the poor, saying: """"We have no right to look away, to turn down the arms raised by the desperate."""" rodneygriffith""",0

Of course majority historians discount it ever actually happening, but it's also known and admitted (as a general point) that ancient pagan nations or kingdoms in general would not always be so honest or straightforward or complete in their recording of everything.

I'm the author of most of the discussion on Alpa cameras.

I'm wondering what you'd like expanded.  

I had edited the Alpa subject to include information about the Japanese Alpa cameras.  Someone else edited my text to indicate these cameras had no connection to the actual Swiss Alpa company.

Happy to add some references and beef up the text when I get chance. But here's one quote from Ratzinger which comes directly before the quotre about it being a"""" fundamental threat to the church.""""

1. Liberation theology is a phenomenon with an extraordinary number of layers. There is a whole spectrum from radically marxist positions, on the one hand, to the efforts which are being made within the framework of a correct and ecclesial theology, on the other hand, a theology which stresses the responsibility which Christians necessarily hear for the poor and oppressed, such as we see in the documents of the Latin American Bishops' Conference (CELAM) from Medellin to Puebla. In what follows, the concept of liberation theology will be understood in a narrower sense: it will refer only to those theologies which, in one way or another, have embraced the marxist fundamental option. Here too there are many individual differences, which cannot be dealt with in a general discussion of this kind. All I can do is attempt to illuminate certain trends which, notwithstanding the different nuances they exhibit, are widespread and exert a certain influence even where liberation theology in this more restricted sense does not exist.

As can be seen he is being quite clear in that only one strand of liberation theology is being condemned.  """,0

"Enough, these bands need to go Vol. 1 

Since someone can't just listen and understand the music, I guess it has to be done the hard way. There are plenty more that can go, but I'll start with one set.

Funeral For a Friend - the band themselves even know they aren't emo (says so in the reference), and anyone that listens to them knows they don't play emo. They don't have emo influences (Deftones, Iron Maiden, Get Up Kids) and they never played/toured with bands in the emo scene. They're nothing more than one of those melodic/post hardcore bands with the 00's decade sound.

Hawthorne Heights - see above. Same thing, no matter if it's as HH or when they were called A Day In the Life.

Ida - first of all, that reference does not even mention Ida as being an emo band. It says folk. And if you actually listen to Ida, it is nothing more than indie/folk music. Just because the guy was in The Hated doesn't mean it's emo. They never belonged here, and nowhere on their wiki page does it mention emo.

Joan of Arc - similar thing to Ida. Yes they had members of Cap'n Jazz, but they took a different direction from their old band and were playing indie rock.

The Juliana Theory - stunned that they would even be mentioned (or maybe not, given some others). Not only could you not find an influence of emo in their sound, but they're really a lot closer to the alternative scene you'd hear on any radio station than even being mentioned in the indie or pop-punk groups. Solid band, but nothing to do with emo.

Lostprophets - already mentioned somewhere around here. One little blurb by some guy that doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't count. This band never had anything to do with emo. Not saying they're a horrible band (because that's not the point). They just don't belong on a list of emo bands.

I have disabled it, sorry. The trigger was blocking edits of  (e.g. ). I have only briefly looked into the coding, and apparently the filter is simply blocking wikilinking by given IPs/users, i.e., it works accidentally, simply because the vandal happens to use a certain IP range and add wikilinks. I haven't thought about a better algorithm (particularly how to detect wlinking of common terms). A spontaneous idea is to target edits that add two wikilinks into one word, like [[pea]][[cock]], i.e. just filter addition of ]][[ - this should have a nearly 100% hit rate, but might be insufficient.

Do note that it is intended as a replacement for a rangeblock on a pretty active range, and the vandal's actions in the past have reached a level warranting a long-term rangeblock.

It also said there was a general raising and fronting of /i/ and /eɪ/; it didn't say anything about raising and fronting only occurring before consonants.

From what I can see Margetic does not talk about the title, he talks about the sovereign entity which is obvious since from 1091 Croatia was in deep anarchy caused by the succession crisis and the subsequent claim by the Hungarian Arpad dynasty. And I actually read what Margetic says and he clearly states Stjepan was in fact recognized by the Pope and styled himself King of Croatia and Dalmatia. Following the end of succession crisis and the victory of Arpad's Coloman continues in same fashion and styles himself rex Croatie atque Dalmatie.

What killed Timothy Treadwell was a combination of his willful disregard of safety practices around brown bears  a violation of wildlife ethics  and his mindless moral values.

In fact, one of the most egregious ways in which tags are being abused is that they're being used for POV-pushing and opinion mongering.  Wikipedia doesn't allow personal opinions in the bodies of articles, and has numerous safeguards in place to prevent it, but having your personal opinion about the nature of an article in the format of a tag, and that opinion will be allowed to disfigure the article practically forever.Were I of a mind to fight against an article I disagree with, politically or philosophically, I wouldn't try to change the text or duke it out on the talk page, I'd stick a """"neutrality disputed"""" tag on it and walk away.

 In fiction and In music consensus 

The consensus (painfully) reached here is that the In fiction and In music sections should contain short representative lists of the most notable instances of chimera in fiction and music (see the article edit history and the arbitration on the article discussion page). These sections should not include every instance since the lists would become so long as to have little or no value and would give the impression that such uses are more important than mythical or scientific uses. Wikipedea is not mere collections of internal links. See what not to put on disambiguation pages, as well.

Consequently, before adding to this section, please take the following steps:
be sure that the article that you are linking mentions chimera. We should not be sending readers that are looking for information about chimera to articles that do not mention the term. 
verify that your addition is at least as notable as the examples already listed and that chimera plays a major, not just a tangential role in the work. 
consider replacing an existing less-notable entry. 
justify your edit on this page.

Finally, if you disagree with my opinion of the consensus, leave your comments here. Please don't edit the article to make your point.  (talk) 

Page move request
To move the page to its classical Latin spelling Chimaera. It is of course a classical creature / concept, which has nothing to do with the US, so why should it be at a recent US variant spelling? -  
I think this is a reasonable argument. On the other hand, the majority modern usage is with the Chimera spelling, I think.  Google finds 3,230,000 (Chimera) v. 1,010,000 (Chimaera). If Google is an indication of use frequency among Internet users, a majority of readers will be searching for Chimera. That is a weak argument; redirects are relatively cheap, or so I think.  (talk) 
Gee, why should it use a recent US spelling? Well, there's Wikipedia:Use English policy, Wikipedia:Naming conventions policy that say we use the most common version, and a conspicuous lack of any policy that says Wikipedia:Use archaic Latin. We spell it the way it's spelled in the real world, it's a little thing called Wikipedia:Use common sense.

At the very least, there are many sources that study the reflectance spectra of Munsell chips. One that is in the public domain is at . The server was awfully slow when I tried to access the links with the ASCII data files; I had better luck with ; click the squares for reflectance data. This website is cited in, for instance,

Incidentally, I now realize that these sources may give enough information to settle the very question I posed. But to really settle it, I would first need the answer to the following: was I wrong in the identification of the Munsell's color in my initial posting? That is,

What is the identity—in the Munsell system—of the Munsell color to which the Wikipedia article is referring? Is it in fact 5RP 5/12?

Having realized my probable mistake above, now I don't understand something else. Look at this statement in the article:
…professional artists, following Munsell color system… regard purple as being synonymous with the red-violet color shown at right, in order to clearly distinguish purple from violet…
In what sense are artists supposed to be """"following Munsell"""" here? Obviously not in nomenclature. Is it the case that the artists do use Munsell's colors in their work, but change the names (e.g. Munsell's purple → artist's violet, and Munsell's red-purple → artist's purple)? I'd rewrite this if I understood what is attempted to be said here.

Weird World of Wikipedia

By Martin J. Walker
February 2006

With this in mind, most people dealing with this issue, attempt to mitigate the problem by understanding that all knowledge is `situated' knowledge, and that all judgements come from a particular standpoint. This means that it is understood that no one can claim to be 100% ‘neutral’ or ‘objective’, and that there are always power struggles involved when someone claims to be `objective` (especially whilst engaging in partisan behaviour).

Angela Kennedy & Jane Bryant, The One Click Group to Jimmy Wales. 
17 November 2005.
http://www.theoneclickgroup.co.uk/documents/ME-CFS_docs/More%20Wikipedia%20On%20Wessely.doc

One Click seems to me to be a bunch of paranoid zealots. And I   will state again that before I tried to tone down the shit they put on the Wessely page I had never heard of them or Simon Wessely.
 Just Z  G, you know? [T]/[C] AfD? 15:46, 
19 December 2005
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Simon_Wessely

A conservative estimate of the number of adults and children suffering from ME suggests that there are around 250,000 in the UK, yet it is rarely diagnosed by the medical profession, is fleetingly mentioned in government research funding documents, is seldom accepted by medical research workers, and is almost never admitted to by insurance companies. 

TABSince 1986, while gathering around him an entourage of like minded disciples which has become known as the Wessely School, Professor Simon Wessely, has almost single-handedly been responsible for the strategy of a moratorium on the investigation of ME as an illness  with a physically neurological cause. Professor Wessely is a psychiatrist, and for nearly twenty years he has promulgated the idea that ME and the broader groupings of chronic fatigue illnesses (CFS) are the product of ‘false illness beliefs’, mental aberrations, which can be diagnosed and treated with psychiatric based therapies and anti-depressants. 

TABProfessor Wessely carries out research mainly in the London-based Institute of Psychiatry which is situated in King’s College teaching hospital. He is a member of numerous research organisations and advisory groups, and is advisor to the British Armed Services. While his membership of an ‘official’ web of research organisations tell us a lot about his work, added substance to his views is to be found in his more informal and less renowned associations with a number of minority-view groups set up by, or aligned with US and British ‘quackbuster’ organisations. 

TABJust before Christmas 2005, the Wikipedia, an electronic and sometimes publicly edited encyclopaedia, was host to a small, anonymous entry about Professor Wessely. The entry appeared to have originated with someone opposed to Wessely’s psychiatric view of ME. On seeing this entry, Jane Bryant of the One Click (OC) campaign substituted a longer text, which contained not just biographical facts but a broader description of Wessely’s role in the politics of ME. 

TABWhen this longer text was seen by the Wikipedia ‘edit police’ who cruise the pages seeking ‘vandalism’ and 'skewed' edits, it was immediately considered to break most of Wikipedia’s self serving rules. On writing to the owner and founder of Wikipedia, ‘Jimbo’ Wales, in an attempt to put their case, the OC campaign received a personal communication from him. 

Although Wales, aimed at a slight up-beat and reconciliatory tone in his e-mail, the text was scattered with veiled insults. He accused One Click participants of ‘behavioural problems’, while stating that OC organisers had lied and purposefully made libellous statements in their posted piece on Wessely. He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that ‘anything from your site (will be treated) with extreme scepticism.’ Jimbo Wales, ended his e-mail with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas.

"""Hi. I appreciate your current efforts to add to the Tony Hendra article. Those efforts will be more successful if you do the following:

 Review the following policy pages: Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view.
 Explain the changes you're making in a brief form in the """"Edit Summary"""" box you see in the edit form, just above the """"Save Page"""" button, or in more detail on the Talk:Tony_Hendra page.

The approach you've taken so far (adding lots of information to the top of the article, then lots of blank space to force the original content way down the page) is problematic, because it represents an apparent effort to """"hide"""" some of the information on the page. Wikipedia doesn't normally work that way.

Assuming you actually are Tony Hendra, I can understand your concerns with some of the current material in the article. The best way to move the Tony Hendra article in the direction you appear to want to move it would be to discuss the problems you have with the article on the Talk:Tony_Hendra page. For myself, I'd be happy to use some of the information you've been adding to flesh out the non-controversial parts of the article (though I would probably want to de-hype it a little to satisfy the Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view policy).

The material on the controversy with Jessica Hendra is more problematic. That controversy exists, and a case could be made that for good or ill it has come to be a significant part of your public notability. To the extent that's true, removing it from the article would be contrary to the interests of Wikipedia's readers, who expect to find relevant biographical information in a biographical article.

You might very well see the matter differently, and if so, you have every right to express that point of view, and to work with other editors to try to improve the article. To the extent we can arrive at some sort of an editorial consensus, though, it will help that improvement process work more smoothly. Discussing your concerns on the Talk:Tony_Hendra page would be a good way to work toward such a conensus.

Thanks.  """,0

 xenocide against me 

I am the foremost expert in the world on Ho-Chunk mythology, at least outside this N. American Indian tribe. There was a stub on this subject that had a short re-written excerpt from my website, so it occurred to me that since there was essentially nothing there, I could perform a service by writing an overview of Ho-Chunk mythology. I had spent three days carefully writing the first three sections of this with an enormous number of footnotes, when some hobbledehoy put in a section extolling the garbage-like ideas of my bitterest academic enemies. Fortunately, only a very small fraction of what I was going to write was entered. I assumed that if this outsider wanted to intrude in the middle of my project, that it would be alright to remove my part of the contribution and give him free rein to do whatever it was that he wanted in pursuing his competing thesis. It makes no sense to me to have a highly scholarly article riddled with severe inconsistencies. That I can't remove my very own contribution is infuriating. 

However, the good news is that my lawyer thinks that I have a good position on this. I took material out of my copy writted website with the thought that at some point I could say, """"reproduced by permission of the author"""". However, I hadn't yet gotten around to that when my article was destroyed by an ignoramus intruder. That means that almost all of it violates my own copy-write. Therefore, under the present circumstances, I not only may withdraw it, but I must withdraw it according to your own rules. I resisted these attempts to force me to surrender my writing to the encyclopedia by every means that I could think of. Except one, of course: a lawsuit for copy-write infringement. 

I'll make you a deal. I'll accept banishment gladly if you will return to me my own writing out of this STUB (!).

 Who were the original members and what did they play? 

I am unable to be sure who the original members of the band were, how many they were, and what instruments they playe. Even sifting through the opening section leaves me with some uncertainty, although para 2 tells me the original drummer. I know this is a voluntary project, and I'm grateful for there being any info at at all. Nonetheless, after reading the first paragraph I'm unable to answer basic questions like this.

The opening says: """"The Jesus and Mary Chain originally revolved around the songwriting partnership of its two main members, plus third founding member, bass player Douglas Hart. In the early days, Reid's guitar would be left out of tune, while Hart's bass guitar only had two strings""""

Who were those two main members? What did they play? One Reid (which one?) plays guitar ... does the other play guitar too? Two main members plus third found member - this implies to me that it was a 3 piece band. Was it? Was the original drummer mentioned in para 2 the other """"main member""""?

Hi Stan - several points; first, neither was there any consensus for Pcpcpc's (if they were his) changes in the first place; I was restoring the original status quo, not making a change. And no request for comment had been made at either WP:TOL talk or from regular botanical contributors, as should have been done, before making that change. Second, botanists are fundamentally different from (almost) all other kinds of people when it comes to nationality; e.g. uniquely only botanists and ornithologists working in Britain and Germany among all people maintained friendly communication and exchange of scientific information throughout the second world war. Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist's wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don't, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118's and Pcpcpc's contributions lists, that they've not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~""",0

"""

Mjpresson initiated the ANI proceedings and got other editors riled up so another editor took care of the formality of proposing a ban; check it out if you want to verify that.

Congratulations to Mjpresson on not being personally a cigarette smoker; neither were Nixon and Reagan who pursued the war against cannabis alias """"drugs"""" to benefit the cigarette industry; how does Mj administer hash without a one-hitter or a vaporizer?

Time running out on the anonymous Public Liebrewery computer forced me to stop 40 minutes ago, therefore the """"unsigned"""" incomplete message; to continue:

My conjecture (which I will be so bold as to share with you here) is that Mj's agenda includes:

 Using Wikipedia to promote the interests of the cigarette industry (through his advocacy in 44 detailed articles about the chain-smoking movie-maker José Mojica Marins whose main character Ze do Caixão (in English """"Coffin Joe"""" sound like Joe Camel?) commits serial murders for sex and personal vindication).  I personally couldn't smoke enough tobacco to stay awake sitting through 88 hours of those horror flicks.  To reference another BRIC country: a 2004-05 study showed 89% of all movies made in India contained depictions of """"tobacco use"""" (almost always cigarettes).

 Trying to remove from Wikipedia cannabis-related articles any information about possible Harm Reduction alternatives to hot burning overdose """"joint"""" smoking such as one-hitters, kiseru, midwakh etc. """"joint"""" and rolling papers are a handy Industry strategy to get children oriented to cigarette smoking.

 Trying to delete information that could serve as a warning against mixing cannabis with tobacco (for example, an edit deleting a reference in the hashish article to an Australian Department of Health study indicating that that practice could lead to unintended nicotine addiction (which is of course what cigarette companies want it to do).

This may explain why, in May 2010, Mjpresson nominated the One-hitter (smoking) article for deletion (reason: """"It's just a bad article."""") (vote: 4-1 for Keep).  By October 2010, after pictures of midwakh, kiseru etc. were added, the article ranked ninth in Category:Cannabis smoking with 1191 hits a day according to a rating survey.  This week, expecting to win the vote against Tokerdesigner at ANI, Mjpresson has deleted over 50% of the One-hitter (smoking) article, including pictures (all-important!) showing what a one-hitter is.

At ANI I have referenced the May 30, 2011 World Health Organization press release claiming that """"tobacco"""" (mainly cigarette smoking of course) will kill 6 million human beings in 2011, and scheduled to rise at present rates to 8 million a year by 2030; so if Mjpresson says Tokerdesigner is a """"single-purpose editor"""" at least you'll understand why.

So again, congratulations for opposing putting a picture of a """"joint"""" atop the [[Cannabis (smoking) article (especially without any warning that there may be tobacco mixed into it), but beware, you have doubtless attracted """"their"""" attention and Big 2WackGo may be after you.

 Note: beware of 3-R's, i.e. by simply reverting mJ'S edit three times you may violate a WP rule aimed at preventing edit wars; better strategy is to change something, add something different with each edit, trying to improve things each time in the interest of a positive solution.  Mj is a stickler for following the rules and will get you for that.  Though I consider him a stooge of the world's leading genocide-for-profit conspiracy I also recognize that Mj is talented and industrious and may do much good someday (after being """"forgiven on grounds of insanity"""").

 Try to find more pictures (make a JPG file and upload to Wiki Commons, I don't have that technology yet) which show better what a one-hitter is (quarter-inch or 6-mm screened crater for 25-mg single servings, instead of 500 mg in a joint every time you want a smoke! avoiding heat shock and carbon monoxide and dopy """"stoner"""" symptoms blamed on cannabis etc.)  Mj objects to the midwakh picture because it is traditionally used for tobacco, not cannabis, but he also deleted it from the one-hitter article where it was clearly described as used for tobacco.  The kiseru picture is a bit indistinct and doesn't show how narrow the crater is.  The major fear of the tobacco industry, even more than cannabis legalization, is the de facto legalization of harm reduction utensils which eliminate the need for high-profit cigarette papers.

It was not a personal attack, but rather a racist remark about Indians in general. No, I did not accuse Anir1uph of being unfamiliar with the English language because he is Indian, his nationality was irrelevant. Anir1uph showed failure to use the English language correctly, common practice among non-native English speakers. I am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit Wikipedia according to their own POV. Anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger Indian demographic who subtly edit Wikipedia pushing their own POV, using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. There is a growing concern among a considerable number of White Western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world - the number of uneducated third world citizens with a POV agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. Nationalism is a large factor in this and it isn't healthy for the Wikipedia community. There is an ongoing clash of culture and outlooks, Asians view the world differently than Europeans and North Americans.

"Toward a better description of the collapse of the SLA

There is lots of detail missing in the account of the collapse of the SLA.

The IDF, according to its plan of withdrawal, started handing major positions in Lebanon over to the SLA in the middle of May 2000. The collapse started on May 22, 2000.  Around a dozen villages and eight SLA posts in the center of the front surrendered to Hezbollah. The posts were mostly manned by Shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by Hezbollah. Hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the SLA in April 2000. The threats were most effective against the Shites in the SLA.

Antoine Lahad, the leader of the SLA was in Paris while all of this was going on. Lahad's departure for France at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the SLA. Lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the July departure of the IDF. He claims to not have been aware of the handover of IDF positions to the SLA in May.

By the end of the day, the SLA front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the SLA positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack. On the morning of May 23, 2000, the western (Druze) sector of the front collapsed. There were (in 2000) reports of a secret deal between Walid Jumblatt and Hezbollah that led to the collapse.

This triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the SLA. Shortly after, both Israelis and some elements of the SLA were moving south. The retreat was finished by the early hours of May 24.

Israeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the SLA.

The controversy in all this is what the Israelis really intended to do in May. Many senior figures in the SLA claim that Israel announced the July departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000. These SLA people claim that Israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the Lebanese could not be trusted with the information. I dont tend to believe these sorts of stories.

My view is that the SLA collapsed out of its own internal weakness. The SLA was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of. Hezbollah worked on breaking off the Shite and Druze elements of the SLA. The Shite portion cut a deal first. The Druze portion, seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after. Lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away.

I think most of what I've wrote can be sourced with newspaper articles from the time (May 2000). I've put this on the discussion page for informational purposes rather than the article itself because all of this would be very controversial. Maybe someday someone can rewrite the section of the article on the SLA collapse.",0

Coomplaint procedure?

No doubt there is a lot of link spam. But no doubt many contributors of good articles start small and then build the piece in layers. That's completely human and completely understandable. The better recourse would have been to insert that tag about possible deletion, rather than deleting within such a short period of time. I had just created the stub. I am new to Wiki and perceived that I was up against a vandal. Indeed I was. How much more disturbing to learn that the destroyer has some form of administrative rights.

I'm new here, and it's not a paying job, clearly. I'm not sure I want to learn the ropes of Wikipedia politics and egos, as the obvious value of Wikipedia is compelling enough, and the ugliness of personalities warped by power within a volunteer effort is unhealthy to that effort. The impulse to characterize someone who stands up for their contribution as """"nasty"""" or """"threatening"""" ... the see-what-I-mean response to a contributor not aware of the emotional satisfaction some may draw from arbitrary deletions, from deliberately provoked confrontations to assure themselves of their own power, is sad. All my foregoing comments no doubt cements some of you more firmly in your smugness and self-satisfaction. Regardless of the barnacles that cling to its hull, I assert that the Wiki concept is, fortunately, apparently more powerful than the base human dynamics it nurtures  but does not ultimately tolerate.

i am asked to let it drop. I don't claim to be a Wiki expert, but I bet there is a complaint procedure. Anyone care to point me in the right direction? The article stub was summarily deleted three times, but after that, the vandal chose to insert an alert of possible deletion instead. This indicates to me that the proper procedure was not followed the first three times. What's the complaint procedure? My further complaint will be regarding the dynamic of portraying someone who stands up for themselves in a reasoned and civil way as having an attitude problem. That's probably the most corrosive thing to a volunteer effort.""",0

Well, if I ask your question, """"Is it acceptable...?"""" I have to ask first and foremost, does it meet WP:NPOV.  To me it does not and therefore it is unacceptable.  There is absolutely no external source that I can address that says """"The phrase waterboarding is a form of torture is acceptable per wikipedia's NPOV policy"""". Nor one that addres that says """"The phrase waterboarding is _________________ is acceptable per wikipedia's NPOV policy"""".  There is no such source and the poll is certainly one of those sources that I am unable to use. HOWEVER, if instead, I read the policy and apply the evidence to the policy, the question comes up: """"Is it disputed?"""".  The poll indicates that it is disputed.  That is how the information in the poll is used.  It is completely inadequate to determine if, in fact, waterboarding is torture, or if wikipedia should say one thing or the other.

"What an irony? The very policies that are used to protect articles on Wikipedia are been exploited by some editors and nobody at Wikipedia can do anything. Nobody has any rights to stop editors who go on a rampage over an article just because of some pov of theirs, using the very policies of Wikipedia used to protect articles. I guess there is no system of checking the edits of such editors against vandalisation such that they can blatantly claim that whatever you report to authorities nobody is going to listen. This is not according to Wikipedia standards and also not healthy with respect to protection of articles on Wikipedia. 

Protection should be such that deletion and blanking should not be allowed to editors other than the author of the article or administrators. This would curtail vandalism to a great extend. It will also stop vulturism in editing wherein editors who do not contribute with any articles but just pick on other editor's articles for whatever reasons would be discouraged and genuine critics would be encouraged who will follow the procedure of mentioning on talk pages for editing.

Furthermore if there are issues it can be discussed in talk pages and updation made accordingly. 

If any author does not log in for specific period of time the article may be alloted to another editor or taken up by adminstrator or it can be locked and put up as library content which can be edited by any administrator. 

This would add international standards as one expects on Wikipedia and also encourge authors to provide more contribution.

Anyway still it is a huge effort by Wikipedia to maintain such a huge collection of articles, it does not matter if a few articles get deleted or vandalised or removed from Wikipedia just because some pov of some editors. I understand to gain something one has to loose something. It is perfectly alright for all administrators and other authorities not to do anything and watch an article getting ripped of part by part.

Hello RR.
I think the link to the Railway Performance Society should be included for a few reasons. Readers can see what the society is about and whether they think its references and research are worthy. Furthermore, to be frank, the RPS generally at least wants some publicity for using """"their"""" sources and data, which, to be frank, I think is fair enough, it`s not as if they`re a business in it to make money. If you want to move the link to the reference at the bottom of the page be my guest. I think this is a classic case where an inflexible attitude to Wikipedia`s """"rules"""" is counter productive. As I say on my """"User page, we shouldn`t lose sight of why we`re actually here.

On the Cecil J Allen book, it is actually a book which I have in my collection, the full title is """"Locomotive practice & Performance in the 20th Century"""", first published by Heffer in 1949.

On the reference thing, my eyes just glaze over when I see that, my brain is already full.... Just as I sometimes edit others grammatical errors, I`m quite happy for others to edit my references if they want !

 Farting 

I reverted this article back to a recent version that contained the term fart. Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia (not a medical one), and its important to use a term that a majority of people know. Flatulence is no more or less a """"proper"""" term than farting is, and its definetly not slang  its use is too common, everyday, and widespread. It would be a misservice the readers to simply ignore this important term. Its such a odd thing to want to sensor.
  
I agree. Why use the word """"flatus"""" all over the place? People don't know it's fart. Doctors know it's fart, and, well, doctors are people, but they ain't most people. The common term is fart or gas.  —   | Talk 
The reason seems pretty obvious to me: """"fart"""" is a much rougher, less """"refined"""" word. Using it casually is simply not appropriate tone for an encyclopedia. -  (Talk at me) 

 Citations needed 

Oh come on, not EVERY sentence needs a citation now, does it.. It makes articles really hard to read and is just silly. I am talking about the section """"Dietary"""" where every second word has a citation or """"citation needed"""". Whoever posted all that is obsessed with citations. seriously!217.231.205.126  
I agree, especially since the rest of the article doesn't seem to conform to the extreme citation standards in the Dietary section. Additionally, some of the stuff is a given and doesn't really need a citation unless you happen to be an alien from another planet who is completely unfamiliar with Earth, in which case it remains a mystery how this alien learned enough english to understand this article without learning some basic information about humans and Earth. Not everyone is a wikipedia administrator, y'know. 74.56.36.34

Why is this article topped by a medical infobox? In the vast majority of occurances, flatulence has nothing to do with either disease or dysfunction.

However, while Zelda does not explicitly say that she's Sheik in OoT, we see Sheik transform into Zelda! The only real explanation would be Sheik jumping out of the way and never appearing again, or something like that, and Zelda just telling some weird story about disguising herself as a Sheikah for no real reason... and this seriously violates Occam's Razor.

I guess even you can understand the stupidity in here, when ethnic turks are being killed it is ottomans and when ottoman soldiers are killing you call it turks..

 More discussion of changes 

Here's a few excerpts from the article that I'd like to visit:

1. """"Smith's earliest religious experiences, which involved heavenly visions and visitations, the use of seer stones to obtain obscure knowledge and to locate buried treasure, were not uncommon where Smith lived, and the fashionably elite Protestant clergy of the area were not impressed by Smith's early visions and divinations, but neither were they likely surprised or alarmed""""

There are a couple problems with the above.  First, whether seer stones were used by others to obtain obscure knowledge particularly """"where Smith lived.""""  (I'll explain why I think that's important later.)  Second, whether Joseph used """"the"""" seer stones (Urim and Thummim) to locate buried treasure, and whether such efforts were religious experiences (to him they were not).  (To my knowledge his treasure hunting efforts were limited to the time prior to obtaining the Urim and Thummim.)  Third, whether the """"fashionably elite Protestant clergy"""" (whatever that means, which probably needs changing) were not impressed by the early visions and divinations (and subsequently not surprised or alarmed).  This claim should either a) be removed for its lack of verifiability, or b) be augmented by the remarks that Joseph himself makes as a first-hand witness.

I honestly don't have a recommended alternative.  The entire paragraph is fairly ripe for discussion in my opinion.  Just to recap:

a. Whether the use of seer stones was restricted to Joseph's residential area.
b. Whether treasure hunting was a religious experience for him.
c. i. Whether the term """"fashionably elite"""" is remotely relevant to the article.
c. ii. Joseph's own recount of clergy response should be included at the very least.

2. """"the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. was raised"""" is facially inaccurate.  Joseph spent the first ten years of his life in Vermont, with only four years in New York prior to the First Vision. I suggest the following rewording of the second half of the entire sentence:

""""that campaign also took place in the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. had lived for four years.""""

3. """"Nevertheless, Mormon extrapolations regarding Jesus are in many ways more similar to the earliest Christian heresies.""""  A rather strong claim , and I don't mind keeping it in, but it should be on the following conditions:
1. """"earliest"""" be quantified to a given year, and """"Christian"""" quanitified to a sect of the time.
2. We add the following text from Hugh Nibley's """"The World and the Prophets,"""" which tells of a time when current generally-accepted Christian beliefs were heresies:
""""Ignatius of Antioch writes to the Trallians: 'There are some Christ-betrayers... They introduce God as being unknown.' And to the Smyrnaens he says: 'Do ye, therefore, mark those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of Christ cannot be known."""" (page 55)
""""The great crime of the heretics in general, according to the Apostolic Constitutions, is 'that they blaspheme God by saying that he is unknowable and not the Father of Christ...but is indescribable, unutterable, unnamable, self-begotten...'"""" (page 55)

4. """"Mormon followers of Brigham Young generally believe in Young's doctrine that Jesus was """"born"""" into a """"spirit body"""", like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his Incarnation.""""

The word incarnation doesn't fit the context of the sentence, and I'd prefer to discuss Mormonism here.  I recommend we change that to say:

""""The branch of Mormonism lead by Brigham Young teaches that Jesus was """"born"""" into a """"spirit body,"""" like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his mortal birth.""""

5. """"He claimed to have received revelation only after asking questions about a subject, pondering, and praying to God for an answer. As Smith's teachings evolved, his later teachings painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son with physical celestial bodies, being one in purpose together with the Holy Spirit.""""

I think the first sentence is out of place (read it in context to see my meaning).  I'd like to clarify the second sentence; it could be understood that Smith's teaching's regarding the Godhead changed rather than expanded.  I'd like to reword as follows:

""""As Smith's teachings about God expanded they gradually painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son than that of other churches, with each possessing a physical, purified body, being one in purpose with the Holy Ghost.""""

We are not assessing the truth claims of a religion - we are assessing the historicity of an individual.  I would actually be quite happy for evidence to exist - it would make the subject more interesting and wouldn't cause the least problem for my view that the supernatural is merely wishful thinking.  Proving a certain man existed ~2000 years ago is a long way from turning him in to a god!  I'm pretty certain Michael Travesser exists, but he ain't anything other than a delusional man - despite what he and his followers believe.

""""List of cities by surface area"""" matches that, except that it mentions """"Juneau City and Borough"""".

The pages about those four individual cities today have figures that match, too. Yet, when I posted in this section several days ago, the article on Jacksonville said 1,962.4 square miles.

Jacksonville's own government website says it has 841 square miles, not 874 or 758.

I'm not sure whether some people or governments are rightly or wrongly putting all of a county's land into the city's listed area. I can say that, in the case of Jacksonville, although the governments of the (a) City of Jacksonville and (b) Duval County are unified, there is (or ought to be) separate reckoning of the city's and county's area, because Duval County also contains three other cities (Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach), which are not part of the City of Jacksonville (they have their own, separate police departments, for example—even though the Jacksonville Public Library is county-wide).

The government website of the City and Borough of Juneau says it has 2,593.6 square miles of land and 487.6 square miles of water, for a total of 3,081.2 square miles. Neither the total nor the land area there matches what Wikipedia gives.

At the government website of the City and Borough of Sitka, I haven't found the area.

Same for the government website of Anchorage. But it does link to anchorage.net, which says the city has 1,955 square miles—which, like the government figures for Jacksonville and Juneau, doesn't match Wikipedia's figure.

First section of history

Is everyone ok with this part of the history?  If so we can go ahead and move it into the article and get started on the second part.

In 1974, Tina Barber, of Shiloh Shepherd Kennel in New York State, began  developing a unique line of German Shepherds. Her goal was to preserve the type of  dog she remembered from her childhood in Germany; dogs who are good family  companions, exceptionally intelligent, mentally sound, big and beautiful - similar to  Chuck Eisenmann's dogs from The Littlest Hobo.  After years of selective breeding  and genetic research, she seperated her dogs from the AKC in 1990.

In 1991, The Shiloh Shepherd Dog Club of America (SSDCA, Inc.) was incorporated.   Shilohs were originally registered dually through the FIC and AKC, but after  difficulty with standards verification, the SSDCA decided to open the first  Shiloh-only registry, The International Shiloh Shepherd Registry (ISSR). Due to some  documentation problems with the original ISSR registrar, a special program was  designed by The Complete Computer Place (TCCP) to process registry data for the ISSR. Since then more than 4,000 dogs have been registered with the ISSR. They also  maintain a database with over 45,000 ancestors in order to properly calculate various  factors within the limited genepool.

Thanks .:..:. babelfish 

Since there haven't been any objections, I'll go ahead and move this to the article so we can focus on working the second section.  I also hope to be able to expand and work on some of the other sections today to get closer to the Manual of Style guidelines and start setting this article up for featured article status. .:..:. babelfish 

This may be too late, but I think the fact that the ISSR was started in 1991 should be made clear and also that the TCCP started to maintain the records in 1993. There are other statements in that second paragraph that don't seem quite right to me either.  

Not too late at all, there's no time when an article is considered """"finished"""".  I did notice that some dates are missing, like the TCCP you mentioned.  You might want to consider rewriting it and then posting it on here before making the changes to the article since that seems to be working to prevent edit-wars. .:..:. babelfish 

In response to the """"others"""" statement that over 50% of the existing ISSR breeders left in '97-98, at Tina's request, I have reviewed the database and put it into a live web page that can be shared with the entire Shiloh fancy.  http://www.shilohshepherds.info/otherBreeders.htm.

I am also preparing other documented data pages that will clearly dispell the objections that have been raised by the """"other"""" """"editors"""".

Also it would have to be paired with fact that the specimen (almost exclusively associated with Y-DNA R1a1) from South Siberia and Kazakhstan (*) had almost exclusively mtDNA haplogroups of west eurasian/european origin especially during bronze age (as far as 1,800 BC).

( http://www.springerlink.com/content/4462755368m322k8/ ), that's meaningful and favors an European origin of these R1a1. 
Especially since no south Asian haplogroups are linked to the spread of R1a1, up to Europe.

Pretty meaningful, especially since such phenotypes are found where high frequency of R1a1 are found in Asia (like

"resignation 

After months of contributing to this site I have finally had enough of its petty, pathetic, idiotic rules and guidelines! Firstly on the article the fog you try adding just a few things and some complete wanker goes and starts undoing it all, just because it's  not what they think is right. Then you get told about a load of rules and guidelines for pitty sake. Why are there rules and guidelines on a free editing site? But worst of all why do some of the stupid editors think they are in government!?!? They think they are all great and powerful but really they're weak and pathetic! 

After all that I had been defeated by a few idiots, so I left it if they want to be that stupid let them. I had been editing George of the jungle 2 for some time but all my work had been undone, I can only think the editor went through my contributions to see what I had been doing. I tried coming to a solution with them but again it was ignored. So because they were determined to have their way I had to let them. This is the sort of thing that goes on a lot and I have had enough. I won't try and contribute as it either goes against what someone thinks is right or goes against some poxy rule! Well what a shit site! Also saying my English is poor, well George of the jungle 2 starts a sentence with anyway for crying out loud!!! I'm done bye thanks for nothing .",1

 Ranchi in Jharkhand 
No need to write NOW Ranchi was in Bihar or it is in Jharkhand, edited where described about Garib Nawaz Rath. Guddu 

 Deification 
Wow, this article seems to make a local god out of Laloo Yadav, while SYSTEMATICALLY ignoring or underestimating his negative sideshim being a curse upon  India. Silly, rare articles have been quoted praising him, while blatantly ignoring his long time image among the educated Indian middle class and the media. Everybody just seems to have a """"bias"""" against himwhat an excuse! All these constitute serious breach of Wikipedia's NPOV. I have added in the intro that he is known for his caste-based politics, his corruption, and his primary mass appeal lies among the so-called backward castes, and I will not tolerate its removal. 

I second this comment. Cygnus_hansa couldn't have been more concise and accurate when he said """"he is known for his caste-based politics, his corruption, and his primary mass appeal lies among the so-called backward castes"""".  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.82.157.73   

This Wikipedia biography seems to be prepared by a staunch fan of Lau Prasad. A much more balanced picture should be presented that should also throw light on his negative impact on the polity and economy of Bihar which lost precious 15 years of development opportunity under his rule which has been often called “jungle raj” or Jungle Rule. A more clear and focussed biography should expose him for a petty corrupt politician with criminal antecedents, that he really is.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 Name 

According to the official profile of Lalu Yadav from bhiar his name is Lalu Prasad NOT Lalu Prasad Yadav. http://164.100.24.208/ls/lsmember/biodata.asp?mpsno=2439  even his father's name does not have Yadav in it.

Education Qualification
I dont think he is a complete illiterate. Can someone add that to this article?
Thanks!  talk  
From what I have heard, he is a graduate (B.A., LL.B) from Patna University, but this is not confirmed. The article certainly does not provide a balanced view of Lalu, again which is not his actual name Lakshmi Prasad. 
Yes I agree this article has too many hyperboles. It would be difficult to confirm his educational qualification given that the person pretends to be rustic in public. As per Indian Government records his name as Lalu Prasad the issue has been discussed above.  

 POV 

I am placing a POV and clean-up tag here because this article is partial to Lalu, has unreferenced statements and some very misleading references. The article does not mention his corruption cases, misrule of Bihar and controversies enough. I don't have the time, but someone is requested to clean it up.  

I think your understanding of Lalu Prasad Yadav is based on the media, which has already been claimed in the article to be biased. I think the article is not at all partial to Lalu Prasad Yadav and at the same time need further improvement. I find that some of the editors are biased against Lalu Prasad yadav, which is reflected from some of the edits intending personal attack on him.   

Wikipedia is full of people like cygnus hansa, especially in Indian circle. many of them had got banned earlier, but some seems to be surviving to this date. This guy has also left some uncivil remarks on my talk page. I am deleting another libelous comment by anon. |no-blast",0

Alh. Cham Joof: Yes, I was the founder and Secretary General of the First Gambian Youth Movement called the Central Council of Youth in the Gambia, in 1957 and I helped to build the Central Council headquarters at Allen Street.
We used to organise annual youth week and sporting events. All kinds of sports were staged including cycling in which Alhagie O.B Conateh (Fisco) used to participate. 
In the field of scouting also, I have been named the doyen of Scouting in the Gambia. Scouting, which is a supplementary to education, was dear in my heart and I served the movement from 1938 up to date. I was the first Gambian Scout to be awarded the coveted badge known as the Wood Badge by the Chief Scout of the World at a successful training course held at the International Training Centre at Gillwell Park in Sussex, England, in 1953. I was also appointed by the Gambia Scouts Council to represent the youths at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth in June 1953.
I also had the opportunity to be selected as the Leader of the Gambia Contingent at the World Scout Jamboree held at Sutton Cold Field in Birmingham in 1957.
As a scout I grew up from Wolf cum Scout, Scout Master, Commissioner in Charge of Training and retired as the President of the Gambia National Scout Council in 2005.
I attended the First Pan-African Youth Movement Conference in Tunisia in 1960 and the second in 1961. I was able to meet Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda and I had the privilege of travelling with Kaunda in the same plane and we had fruitful discussions about politics. I also helped in the creation of a Unit called the Hansard Unit at the National Assembly in 2002 and I was appointed as a member of the International Committee of Dispute Resolution in 2002.
I was also appointed as a member of the Dispute Tribunal Unit of the Magistrates Court in Banjul in 2003 and I retired in 2007.
I am the current chairman of ECO (Education through Culture Organisation) which is an International NGO.

From Wikipedia:

What counts as a reliable source
Further information: Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources
The word """"source"""" in Wikipedia has three meanings:

the type of the work (some examples include a document, an article, or a book)
the creator of the work (for example, the writer)
the publisher of the work (for example, Oxford University Press).
All three can affect reliability.

Base articles on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is """"made available to the public in some form"""".[6] Unpublished materials are not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. The best sources have a professional structure in place for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.

If available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources, such as in history, medicine, and science.

Editors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:

university-level textbooks
books published by respected publishing houses
magazines
journals
mainstream newspapers.

  
Editors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria. See details in Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources and Wikipedia:Search engine test.""",0

 Government Opinion: Australia - wording

The unanimous opinion of that Court was that Scientology is a religion.

This document states (Section 5):
The question whether Scientology is a religion cannot be answered, for there seem to be important, perhaps critically important, tenets of Scientology which the parties left without full examination. The question which can be answered is whether the beliefs, practices and observances which were established by the affidavits and oral evidence as the set of beliefs, practices and observances accepted by Scientologists are properly to be described as a religion.

Keep in mind also that it is possible to live in a region one's entire life and not speak with the accent associated with that region, i.e., some people in the South have accents that are more similar to those of the West or Midland.  The same might be true for the Inland North.  Read this.  Specifically read p. 139 where it says Transitional Cities.  It explains this a little bit, though not as much as I would want it to.  Maybe you can find a more in depth explanation elsewhere, like in the real Atlas of North American English.  That's all I have to say.   """,0

Why would you respond? You worship Einstein, who was #1 for building the nuclear weapon bomb, singed letters to F.D.R. begging him. Perhaps you are not too bright. The entire article is found in the Lemonsier Biograghy  all these views, including the anti-American viewpoint. In that biograghy littered with assumptions, the narrative states Nostradamus was a money grubbin Jew-crap. This is a POV, not professional at all. 

Einstein did not know of Dark Matter or subgiant stars can turn into Supernovas, like one that is happening right now in Canis Minor. This is not the """"original version """" dope.""""

""""Einstein did not believe in a personal God. It is however, interesting how he arrived at that conclusion. In developing the theory of relativity, Einstein realized that the equations led to the conclusion that the universe had a beginning. He didn't like the idea of a beginning, because he thought one would have to conclude that the universe was created by God. So, he added a cosmological constant to the equation to attempt to get rid of the beginning. He said this was one of the worst mistakes of his life. Of course, the results of Edwin Hubble confirmed that the universe was expanding and had a beginning at some point in the past. So, Einstein became a deist - a believer in an impersonal creator God:"""" (http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/einstein.html)""",0

[Moved post from Sarah down to proper chronological space; it interrupted my unblock request subsection placed chronologically before it above.   ]

As one of the victims of your repeated and persistent personal attacks and false accusations, I don't think that you should be unblocked early because I feel that a message needs to be sent about your continued personal attacks, blatant violations of AGF, CIVIL and NPA, which are even prominently displayed on this very talk page in your lengthy commentaries about Orderinchaos in particular. I have tried to stay away from here since the ANI was closed, but as you continue making accusations and comments about me, I must say that I consider your comments to be personal attacks and I consider the post that Gnangarra linked to in particular to be defamatory and libelous and I feel that you should agree to refactor those comments, and the other personal attacks you made about editors on ANI, as I see has also been previously suggested by Shell as well. The """"do not edit the archive"""" notices in the ANI archives are designed to prevent people from continuing discussions in the archives, rather than to prevent people removing defamatory material. You claim that you've been """"slandered"""" (actually libeled). I believe everything I have said about you has been absolutely true, however, if I have inadvertently made a mistake and it was pointed out to me, I would redact it. Unfortunately, every time I have interacted with you you have made demonstrably false accusations, accusing me of doing things I had clearly and provably not done at all and so I am rather reluctant to believe that I have posted something factually untrue, but I am quite prepared to go back and re-examine my comments and refactor if I have made a mistake. When you wrote these offensive and defamatory comments about me, I had been deliberately trying to refrain from saying very much on the ANI due to your previous hostile reactions to me and had actually made very few comments, only responding to people who were confused or misunderstood and thus your accusations at that point in time were totally over the top and unfair and did not measure up to the evidence of my posts. Additionally, you are completely anonymous and not known by your real life identity, whereas I have spent most of my time on Wikipedia editing under my full name and am well known and you yourself have even commented about knowing my full name, so I find your comments and accusations defamatory to me in the real world. I feel you should agree to refactor your personal attacks against, not just myself, but others too, and I must therefore support previous requests for you to refactor these personal attacks and false accusations. Please also note that BLP applies to all pages on Wikipedia, not just to articles, Wikipedia:BLP#Non-article_space, and so if you persist in keeping your personal comments about me, a living, known and identifiable person, I must once again for the nth time insist that you provide verifiable proof supporting your allegations and accusations because you are in violation of BLP. Sarah 

Gnan, Shell, Sarah: Please see reply posted to Shell below #Malfunctioning archive bot and improper page creations? prior to the reply by Sarah; did not see it; restored proper chronological order to these posts.  Sarah: In #request (first line of my reply) I already gave permission to Gnan/garra to do what is needed in that now-unmentionable (for me) matter to remove from it anything that might be (mis)construed as a """"personal attack"""" by anyone reading it WP:NPA in reply to #request; but I myself do not feel comfortable touching an archived discussion in a project page, which is filled with comments that could be (mis)construed as """"personal attacks"""" upon me as well (""""rant"""", """"screed"""", expletives, etc.).

"""==Additions to Origins: The Subjects==
I feel that it would be effective, either in its own section or within Origins, to expand on the audiences that ethnographic films are geared towards.  The article now seems to focus well on the aesthetic and historical context and the scientific research and study that can be done.  However, it is only slightly mentioned through  """"Nai, the Story of a !Kung Woman"""" on how the actual subjects or indigenous tribes react-to and can utilize this film.

In order to expand on this topic, I was thinking of a rough statement like this would be ideal:

Indigenous tribes and people often have clearly defined practical reasons for participating in ethnographic films.  Such reasons include creating a record of their lives for future generations, warning authorities of potential problems, exchanging cultural information with other cultural groups and educating dominant cultures.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007.  An ethnographic film by indigenous creators can also concentrate heavily on a particular movement towards indigenous activism.  The way an activist approach is accomplished is when filmmakers approach the issue with a tactic of openness, which ultimately no longer makes the camera a transparent object and instead an actor on stage that is allowed to be lead by its subjects.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007

Request for Comments on Current events
Hello Fsotrain09 –

I'm trying to get some discussion going on two proposals regarding the current events page, but so far have gotten little to no response. Since you have recently edited the current events page, I'm asking for your input on these two proposals:

One proposal (this is the big one) involves putting the daily events from the current events pages into article-templates, a lá the monthly pages from 2003 to 2005, as well and having a consistent number of recent days on the current events page instead of a monthly archive. This would allow for the current events page and the respective month pages to be updated simultaneously without the monthly archival. For more, see the current events talk page. 
Another proposal involves merging the content of the regional current events pages (such as British and Irish current events and Canadian current events) into fewer continental articles. For more, see the current events WikiProject talk page. 
Your input on one or both of these issues would be appreciated. joturner

Guantanamo detainee
Thanks for the suggestion.

I have been wondering how to organize the data.

The DoD, and the Washington Post lists tried to shoehorn the names into the English style first name and last name format. It didn't work very well, because names can have so many different transliterations. And some nations, like Yemen, have areas where people can have a tribal name, that looks like a surname to us. Maybe sorting them by first name, within nationalities, would be better.

I'll work on it.  Geo Swan

Hey  Just a friendly reminder to be sure to use an edit summary that says """"prod"""" when you propose an article for deletion. It's always good to use edit summaries, of course, but it's especially helpful for proposed deletion, because prod tags are not supposed to be re-added once they are removed, and the easiest way to tell if a prod tag was previously placed on an article is to look at the edit history. Also, in this case, I marked the article for speedy deletion; when it applies, speedy deletion is better than prod, because it requires less attention. I left the prod tag there, though, just in case anyone denies the speedy deletion (which I doubt will happen). Anyway, thanks, just letting you know! Mangojuicetalk

Thanks Bugs, I trust in my response to your comment that you (if not others) understood the reference to """"nonsense as this false accusation"""" to be the accusation (not made by you) of making a gender based insult, rather than your comment being nonsense.75.4.195.159  

Thanks Doc, one gots to like a detail guy (the refernce to """"guy"""" being intended as gender neutral). I should like to characterize it as trying to get an answer and redirecting the topic back to that topic (not without personal failures along the way) of getting an answer; rather than pestering. Though when someone doesn't want to answer the on-topic question, and only responds with condescending stonewalling, I have no doubt that the pony would characterize the May fly as pestering her.

The other points you make, and more you raise in your second post, run down a path that, in avoiding a failure to stay on topic, we shouldn’t take. As to Dayewalker's gender: if Dayewalker (or one of Dayewalker's friends or acquaintances) would simply state that Dayewalker wishes to be referred to by the male or female personal pronoun, that works for me. I don't care which Dayewalker actually is. Whichever they wish to have used here is fine. Until then, and basing my guess on the name alone, and ascribing no gender traits to any of Dayewalker's words or actions, I have referred to Dayewalker as a she. If that is not the correct gender, just cut the rhetoric and say that Dayewalker should be referred to with a male pronoun. If Carol O'Conner could live with his name and constant gender misidentification, one hopes that an adult with the name Dayewalker should realize people are going to offer up their best guess at what gender pronoun to use.
 
I did, having noted your apparent, yet vague, complaint, searched via Google. The first result for """"Dayewalker"""" is to someone named """"Chris"""" on Twitter. No help there, """"Chris"""" could be male, could be female. The next one of any potential was someone named """"Daye Walker,"""" so that's promising. Maybe Dayewalker is """"Daye Walker."""" Makes sense. I can't know for sure, but it appears that """"Daye Walker"""" is a woman as Daye Walker puts another name that would appear to be a maiden family name in parenthesis. However, in a modern age, that may not be what she is indicating by this choice of presenting her name, nor is that taking of one's spouse's family name upon marriage universal to either gender, But why guess when someone could simply state the fact? Unless one perfers to create issues and avoid answering the on-topic question posed.75.4.195.159

Nor does that article have any of the criticisms that people might make of the concept of state religion, or religion in general (and I think it's right for the article not to cover it, as we cover it better elsewhere).

Hi Lara! Yes, the way you can link to specific places in an article is pretty simple in the old html only days (when I started writing code) you had to use  but since the anchor type tag is disabled in wikimedia, you have to use  and by using this ID, it means you can link to the spot by using Foo#lorem ipsum. Another way you can do this is to use the  template, which can be hidden into a header line, or embedded anywhere within an article. I hope this helps! linca

1st paragraph:
Having been the early Brazilian republican period, nothing more than a Army dictatorship, already in 1891 from the unfoldings of the bubble of encilhamento and the 1st naval revolt, the country entered in a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by several rebellions, both civilian as military, which little by little undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930, in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most military, lead a revolt.

2nd:
Vargas and the military, who were supposed to assume the government temporarily to implement democratic reforms related to 1891's Constitution, closed the Congress and ruled with emergency powers, replacing the states' governors with their supporters. Under the Claiming of the broken promises of changing, in 1932 the oligarchy of São Paulo tried to regain the power and in 1935 the Communists rebelled, having both been defeated. Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections launching a coup d'état in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship. In May 1938, there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists.

3rd:
In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of this period, was followed by a failed attempt to permanently exert a prominent role in the League of Nations, after its involvement in World War I. In World War II Brazil remained neutral until August of 1942, when the country entered in that war on the allied side after suffer retaliations undertaken by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, due the country have severed diplomatic relations with them in the wake of Pan-American Conference. With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, being the Democracy """"reinstated"""" by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before. Having returned to power democratically elected at the end of 1950, Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis.

"""==Why I don't edit often anymore==

Back in the day I used to edit wikipedia on a fairly regular basis. One of the pages I edited was the eXile. One detractor of the eXile, Peter Ekman, was so pathologically obsessed with discrediting the periodical, that he would devote weeks at a time to blanking and otherwise vandalizing the eXile article while launching reckless accusations at everyone who """"defended"""" the eXile. Although many editors did our best to contain Mr. Ekman, eventually he wore me down. It just wasn't worth it spending my free time containing the vendetta of some aggrieved middle-aged jerk.

As a parting bow in my too-long Ekman drama, I wanted to post here a summary about Mr. Ekman's character and the original wiki text that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade.

About Peter Ekman

Peter Ekman is the aforementioned hack journalist who crusaded against the eXile. But once upon a time Ekman actually had an impressive sounding job working as an editor for the Moscow Times and dispensing right-wing platitudes in the heart of the former communist empire. Moscow in the 90s was a place where failures didn't fail. And for a long time Ekman didn't fail, despite his total lack of social graces and limited intelligence. Eventually his columns attracted the ire of the fellow Moscow publication, the eXile.

Originally the eXile was planning only on criticizing Ekman's written work, but Ekman's response was righteous, menacing, and hinted at violence. So the eXile's added a personal detail: they included the account of a female employee who had been subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by Mr. Ekman. Mr. Ekman had groped the employee while inviting her to a weekend get-away while his Russian Bride was out of town. Ekman responded with the same witless ape-shit animosity that I have since personally witnessed many times on wikipedia. Ekman attempted to get the eXile banned from Johnson's Reading List by declaring the eXile was a fascist, neo-nazi periodical. Ekman's evidence for such nazi sympathies was a spoof fashion piece entitled """"The eXile's Third Reich Uniform of the Week,"""" in which a fictional gay fashion designer breathlessly reviewed the 1938 version of the Nazi Field Bishop uniform.

Eventually Ekman lost his position at the Moscow Times. Since then he's occasionally surfaced as a professor of finance at various 3rd rate universities and, of course, here on Wikipedia.

The following is an excerpt from the Wikipedia Article on the eXile that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade:

Peter Ekman, Johnson's Russia List, and an Unsubtantiated Groping Allegation
In November 2000, in Issue #23 of The eXile, Matt Taibbi published a press review entitled Peter Ekman Groped Me.  The article ridiculed Ekman, then newly appointed editor of The Moscow Times, for his approach to the economic and political development of Russia.  Taibbi characterized this approach as high-handed, condescending, and arrogant, and went on to mock Ekman personally as a pompous hypocrite: """"Ekman has only one idea (""""Russia has a lot to learn from America""""), which he tries endlessly to sell and resell as a varied package of ribald wit and insight.""""  The article also ridiculed Ekman for describing himself as a """"financial educator,"""" and described him as having """"a head seemingly worn bald from improper use.""""  As a finishing touch, Taibbi recounted an as-yet unverified account of sexual advances made by Ekman to an eXile employee, made at late at night at the Garazh nightclub in Moscow during a visit from Ekman's mother-in-law.

Ekman responded by writing in to Johnson's Russia List to claim that """"the eXile is fascist and racist,""""  that """"every eXile issue contains unverifiable stories that smear someone's reputation,"""" that The eXile """"is associated with the fascist party of Eduard Limonov."""" The accusations of fascism were discounted by many in part because of the eXile's Jewish roots - Ames, along with the eXile's publisher, deputy editor and several contributors are all Jews - and because of the paper's satirical editorial bent. It remains unclear as to whether Ekman did in fact make advances toward an eXile employee, or who that employee may have been.

Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes.

“The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"""" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear.

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

To be very blunt, I do not believe you. Checkuser data indicates with almost absolute certainty that all of these accounts are unquestionably being operated by the same person. So many questions arise now... I want legitimate answers to these:
How did some of the accounts you claim are completely unrelated to you find out about the WikiCup and sign up for it?
Why did you sign up for the Wikicup with accounts you claim you were only going to use as bots? 
How do your neighbors manage to have absolutely identical hardware and software (not common software either) installed on their computer that you do, and edit with the same mobile devices? The same with your pen pal. Strange...
Why are you letting your older brother access your accounts? 
Why did you lie to me and say that Reborn American was your brother, and that you now have his computer, when I can see clearly from checkuser data that that account has never accessed Wikipedia using anything other than an iPhone?
To be honest, if you had said from the beginning that they were all being operated by you, I would have warned you not to do it in the future, and probably left it at that. Now that I know that you are not securing your accounts from your own brother... Not to mention knowing that you are willing to flat-out lie to me.... Let me just leave it at, my attitude is slightly different now. gabsadds 

I'm not trying to lie (in fact I never lie when it comes to serious matters just like this) but I'm serious about every single detail. I'm afraid I'll just leave it like that. Please don't block me for what my brother did. I can't take anymore criticisms and hatred  because of what I am and what I think.    

Ps. These are my answers. 
1. I told them about this competition and they were very interested so I told them """"Go ahead. Do it.""""
2. I said Runs like a cheeta, stings like a bee and IronMöogol8.0 were going to be my bots and they weren't on the signup list.
3. My father works for a computer company and he built some for my neighbors and for my penpal in Tusla. The mobile devices, however, I'm confused about too.
4. I didn't. He would take my accounts by force.
5. I said my younger brother is Reborn American and I own my older brother's computer. Other than the time he used his account on my iPhone, her forgets that he has an account and edits on mine instead.
6. Everything is true.

Wikipedia's pretty popular nowadays, eh? Penpals, neighbors, and siblings. My pet goldfish is making an account soon, just so you know.  [[User_talk:IMatthew|talk]] at 

Secret Saturdays, I have reviewed J.delanoy's checks, and I concur with him entirely. So, you have a choice now: pick an account and stick to it please. You can just mention here which one you want to keep using.    

Fine, I'm sticking with Secret Saturdays.   

But I still have a question: since this matter is about cleared up, do I re-sign myself to wikicup or do they need to do an assessment?   
You will need to ask whoever is coordinating it what to do. gabsadds 
Secret Saturdays, the competition doesn't start until next year. I'll allow you to re-add your name on October 31, at the end of the current competition; so long as you've stuck to one account from now until then (and of course forever afterwards).  [[User_talk:IMatthew|talk]] at

"Hi Danimations, I have some suggestions.  Firstly, the inclusion of sections about “Role and origins” and “History” (or maybe “History and achievements”) would be helpful.  A possible source of information is the six annual reports for the Premier's Climate Change Council which can be downloaded from the DEWNR website.  Just paste “Premier's Climate Change Council’ into the search box on the home page.  Secondly, with respect to the “Membership” section, content explaining from what sectors of the community the members are sourced from should be added.  Also, the “dot point” lists should be converted into a paragraph of names in alphabetical order with the words “(chair)” after the person who currently has this responsibility.  I suggest this for two reasons - firstly, the ‘lists’ do dominate the article and secondly, as the article does not appear to be intended to be a list as per WP guidance.  I will have a look again early tomorrow morning.  Regards",0

Just to give an example... I've been to church until like a year ago despite I never liked catholiscism and in fact, I feared it when I was a kid.
and why did I do that? I did that because I didn't dare have a rational conversation with my parents, and what happened when I did? I was called a terrorist by my fucking father, among other things... I had to cry for days, I was ignored, made fun of and insulted... what did my mother do? she didn't force me to be a catholic like my father tryed to do, but she didn't help me either, she just seemed to agree with him, while agreeing with me when he wasn't there... just like an evil cat.
and she does just that all the time, she complains about my father's obssesive controlling personality with me and my sister, but when my father says all his bullshit to me she never says a thing, but it's different with my sister(16) because my mother supports her against my fathers crazy temperament.
my father treats me like I'm a 30 year old drug addict living off his money. he doesn't get that I'm studying a career and that(like everyone here, I dunno about other countrys) he has to pay for it... it's not like I'm not doing anything! my 'god'...
whenever I'm happy what do they do? I swear to my life that they FUCK THINGS UP FOR ME no matter what. 
and whenever I'm sad (that's most of the time arround them, because I don't dare to even joke arround with them since they are offended by anything) whenever I'm sad they come with theyr you need god in your life bullshit.
or theyr see? we are right and u r wrong bullshit...
I'm sick of this, I just wanna get a fucking job, get out of this house and lead a NORMAL LIFE where I'm not issolated from my friends  and can go out and have fun with them without being threatened with loosing the internet conection or being taken out of college...
and my sister? according to my friends who kind of know my situation... she's envious of me and that's why she treats me like shit and doesn't even respect my room like I do hers.
and can you believe I love them???? I do , and that's why I think Im looney, because this isn't possible...
I forgive them every single time! but If I want to hold on to my physical and mental health and have somwehat of a good future, I have to develop a stiff upper lip and not give a shit about them anymore.and I should even take regenge according to most of my friends! but I don't even want to!..I just wanna be left alone anf try to forget all I've been through... I just wish it was physical abusse so I could show my scars and make a point, but this way...anyone can think I'm crazy.
Maybe this is the cause of all my existential doubts, because I don't have anything to be sure of and feel confident about in my everyday life becase my family does the job of ruining everything for me.

I'm sorry for all the swear words, but I had to express how I felt somewhere, also I think I'll erase this because I don't think it's allowed at all on wikipedia, it's just that there's so much rational people here that I think I can get some good advice and I've nowhere else to turn.",0

Speedy deletion of Myst fight klub

"As far as Muslims are concerned any criticism of Islam is hate speech. I have been a Muslim for five years and know perfectly the hatred that Muslims have for apostates and the level of intolerance towards their critics. Been there, done that myself, without even being aware of it. It all seemed normal to do. Today I find myself on the other side of the fence. Quoting opinions contrary to those believed by Muslims is not hate speech. The Quran is filled with hate speech. Look at the article Ali Sina for example: that is hate speech. The very language is despiteful. My every contribution to Islamofascims, Islamofobia and Ali Sina are removed. The only reason is because they are not in agreement with Islamic creed. We must not allow Wikipedia to be converted into an Islamic tool of propaganda. Both views must be expressed equally. Take the example of Sina’s page. There we have six comments made by anonymous Muslims calling him all names including a mischievous liar, a rabid anti Islamist, Islamophobe, etc. In the paragraph that said “Ali Sina is a controversial personality” I quoted an example of how diverse are the opinions of Sina’s fans from those of his foes.  This is not to agree with those opinions. Muslims resisted this example tooth and nail, with all inane and invalid excuses. I made it clear that this is not an endorsement of those views and the notability of the people making those allegations or praises are not important. They are just a sample of what people say about him. It goes from one extreme to another. I think both examples should be stated so the claim that he is a controversial is supported with these examples. Why Muslims do not want to have any mention of what Sina’s fans say about him and only the insults of his foes are mentioned? Any fool will see this article is written by people with an axe to grind against it subject. 
Since I joined Wikipedia, every contribution I made was removed and reverted and incidentally those who removed them were invariably Muslims. Am I not allowed to put the two together and conclude that this is Islamic zealotry at work? OceanSplash13.Dec. 2005 18:20",0

During May 26h., I tried to add comments to the page and then had a discussion with him, above, which closed the matter between us.The following day, I posted links on the Talk pages of the other alleged conspirators, one of whom is . The entire correspondence with him reads as follows:

==Discussion involving you==You might be interested in the discussion on my 'Talk Page', here, which indirectly involves you. It is disappointing that the author has not notified you himself.  (talk) Seen all that. Out of context, of course, in every sense. In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then. It seems he wants people perpetually punished for not agreeing with him or for voting on the same pages. I'd hate to list all the AfD and other pages he and Vintagekits collaborate on. But thats all right. Regards,  :Yes; the image of a dog licking its own balls comes to mind. (talk) 

The metaphor is supposed to represent a self-indulgent act which gives great pleasure to the participant but which others view as embarrassing and repulsive.

The next thing I know is that some random Admin has popped up, blocked me, and disappeared again, reappearing on the Administrator's Noticeboard waving my scalp around. The diff link on the Noticeboard refers to the last post only, and a number of commentators on the Noticeboard immediately agree with the view that it is a WP:NPA.

I pause here to point out that either the Admin herself, or I (before I was blocked), could have blanked the comment, perhaps with a warning on this Talk page. I would have been perfectly happy to have done so myself, because I like to think of myself as reasonable and because the post was not intended as an attack; had I wished to criticise  I would have done so on my own Talk page discussion with him. (As it is,  had the sense to blank the discussion in any case.)

Anyway, that said, I reply as follows to those who have posted comments here:

' I hope that I have demonstrated that we're at cross-purposes. Frankly, however, you've made no attempt to engage with either myself or  or to resolve the dispute between us. You might just as well have blocked one of us at random.

' Thank you for yours. You're the dog's bollocks!

' Point taken, for what it's worth (I had initially understood 's complaint to be with the vulgarity of the metaphor rather than her seeing it as an attack). !vote discussions increasingly resemble a mass outbreak of Tourette's syndrome.

' Thank you for yours. I note you seem to have had rather an unpleasant discussion with  yourself on the subject, and I should like to thank you for your interest and understanding. I have also had a look at your User page, which I found very interesting and would like to comment further on your Talk page in due course. To answer your point, I did see how to request an unblock, but as the block was only for 24 hours, and the ground had anyway been cut from under my feet by 's posting on the Administrator's Noticeboard which had garnered approval for the block. I also dislike complaining to Admins about other people's behaviour; it just seems a bit wet to me (and I don't do it myself).

Vandalism warning
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

"Evolution Article

Hello Slrubinstein, I was a witness to the vast changes in the evolution article. Once it started it was like a wild fire. In fact, I saw it coming and tried (and failed-oddly phrased and hyperlinked on Dec 8)to improve the first paragraph. After Adam's changes, I realized the experts have had their say it seems appropriate to let the novices have ago. I wrote to Roland and Graft with this sentiment, but also my apprehensions-that it is too simplestic, may lead to misconceptions, not neccessarily improved where it is good, and this method of rapid and bulky changes will start a stampede (which it has). Roland is studying for exams, but dropped in enough to say he hated all the changes. I have been trying to be supportive of their effort, but hoping all the expert editors who gave me a hard time would resurface to defend the merits of the original article. I thought the first paragraph did need some attention, but I thought minor edits would ensue not vast rewrites. This could go on forever. Why can't an article be protected at certain stage so Talk could continue but changes would go before a committee to decide whether the change or addition is warranted (keep it current). I actually wrote a section for Evodev a few weeks ago, but never added it. I was concentrating on a couple of good examples, but now I realize a better way. There is some movement in embryology and developmental biology which is good. Fill does have some good editing for a Simple:evolution article. Isn't there a wikipedia for kids also? Although I wanted to change or add to the original, it was an excellent and informative article. It has been a week since the major overhaul so now maybe it is time to critique.",0

Romantic Friendship, Not Lesbianism

This article needs to be edited to change the way it deals with the argument that the Ladies were """"lesbian"""".  The Laides themselves denied this, and in fact I am not aware of any evidence that their relationship was sexual.  Yet the article refers to them as though they were in fact lesbians.  We must be careful not to impose modern ideas about sexual identity on people from the past.

In previous eras in history, it was more common for heterosexuals to express their affection for friends of the same gender in more passionate terms than we are accustomed to today. Indeed, same-gendered friends would often have an emotionally and physically intimate relationship (but without any sexual content). This was known as """"romantic friendship"""". However, since the Victorian era (with its rigid attitude towards the sexual), such relationships have declined, and there is a homophobic tendency to brand people who seek intimate (though non-sexual) relationships with people of the same gender as gay. This is something I regard as deeply unfortunate; it stems from our tendency to rigidly delineate what is """"gay"""" and what is """"straight"""". In some ways, our modern society is very insecure in terms of sexuality.""",0

Theoretically, polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms: polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time, polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men, and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women.  Of these, only the first is common.

And on page 25 

A statistical analysis of Kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages, as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous, 18 per cent for polygynous, and 60 per cent for monogamous unions.

I do have an intention of participating with well-reasoned commentary on the same AFD's based on the same sources they use.

This has been discussed here and elsewhere, including talk pages linked to from this section (that is, #Iran).

 Animation 

There is something very unique about south park.Because of the style of animation, it is actually possible to have an episode of south park in an .svg animation, which is a file format that allows for unlimited up-conversion of images and animation but only in a way of simple shapes,and since south park is already a somewhat brick style animation, you could theoretically up-convert it to high definition using the .svg format and it would look just like that was the normal resolution.  
That's true.  Also, computer episodes can readily be made available in smaller size files (such as .rm), instead of the much-larger .mpg, .avi, or .mpeg.  I think that's a big reason the show has garnered such a cult following on the internet. 17 """,0

"MSU Interview 

Dear Jimfbleak,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Perhaps some of this misunderstanding stems from a sentence I could have worded better which read as follows: """"All I was trying to do was provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from."""" 

If I could take back the word """"template"""" I would, since it was clearly construed as meaning something totally different from what I was trying to state.  What I was trying to state comes down simply to accurate """"facts and dates"""" regarding Billy the Kid, and bringing the state of those many """"facts and dates"""" up to date to this point in time. Before it was removed, my Wikipedia article reflected the status of Billy the Kid research as it exists today. There were 147 detailed citations, which sourced the work of such noted Kid historians as Philip J. Rasch, Robert M. Utley and Frederick Nolan among many others. Before it was last removed on December 17, that version that I was working on contained the most accurate version of the Kid's life that has yet appeared on Wikipedia. That version of the article contained contributions by several researchers - not just me.

Then it all went away, when the article was removed for reasons that make no sense - at least not for anything contained in the article itself. I attempted to restore the version that I had been working on at 11:47 17 December 2015. I attached a note that read: """"Please do not delete this version of the Billy the Kid article. It contains the contributions of several respected historians, and remains the most comprehensive, and accurate treatment of the subject that has appeared on Wikipedia so far.""""

My restoration only stayed up for 4 minutes and and was once again removed at 11:51 on 17 December 2015.

I made what turned out to be a final attempt at restoration six minutes later at 11:57 17 December 2015. This time I left a note that said """"The continued deletion of an article by myself, and several other contributors, goes beyond vandalism and borders on being criminal."""" The crime was against historical honesty, accuracy and, indeed, the goals that Wikipedia is supposed to stand for. The total lack of respect to those who contributed to the article goes without saying.

This time, for my troubles, I was blocked - and my blocked status remains in effect until Dec. 24. Merry Christmas.

The irony is that when the version of the article I last worked on was deleted,  on December 17, I was done with it. I had no plans for further changes. I had hoped that others would then jump in - particularly those who possess the Wikipedia editorial skills I lacked to make it go along with your manual of style and other Wikipedia preferences.

Billy the Kid, as you all know, was born in lower Manhattan in New York City. I would like to use New York City as an analogy for how I view Wikipedia. Since the early 1960's I've spent a considerable amount of time, off and on,  in New York City. Those of you who have been there frequently know that there is always construction going on. Indeed, change is a constant in New York City. Change is also a constant with any Wikipedia article. As stated, it was never my intention to """"own"""" the article. I never expected, or wanted, it to remain frozen in place with my contributions. I was looking forward to contributions from other historians and researchers who could provide further info on the """"facts and dates"""" contained in the article, as well as working with experienced Wikipedia editors who could correct any mistakes that didn't go along with your preferred """"encyclopedic"""" standards.

Anyway, we seem to have ended up, at least for now, at cross purposes. Why it got to this point I don't understand. I am not looking for adversaries, at Wikipedia - I am looking for the collaboration of any and all who truly want to make the Billy the Kid article the best it can possibly be today - and, with the continued contributions of others, in the years that follow.

The quickest way to make this happen is by taking my",0

 Re the surname Rossi Lemeni. 

         I could cite many hyphen less articles, covers,  posters etc for Rossi Lemeni.   La Scala certainly set off hyphen less - as here for example  La Scala Milan Verdi, Messa da Requiem conducted 
         by Victor de Sabata 27 Gennaio 1951.   Record sleeves """"Grandi Voci alla  Scala"""" ,   """"Il Barbiere di Siviglia""""  La Scala Milan IDIS 6479/80,   """"Anna Bolena""""  La Scala Milan MYTO historical live,
         and the published poetry  """"AMICO"""" etc is without the hyphen, so your argument, whilst obviously with foundation, is not nearly as overwhelming as you make out. 

         However, as you are clearly totally opposed to this alteration would you accept, at very least for the sake of clarification and information for your readers, mention of the unhyphenated name

"Ok, in summary, Mark Twain is not a WP:RS because there are accurate estimates of concomitant population, which is contradictory to your earlier statement that There are no accurate estimates of population at the time so laregely scholars can relate to the observations of travelers at the time.  This reference and others like it breech WP:RS by not conforming to the subsection Beware false authority

Authority of authors   
Prefer authors with an established reputation in the field where Wikipedia uses them for reference. 

Mark Twain is a satirist and a writer of fiction, not a respected demographer.

These references are also in breech of 

Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence

Claims not supported or claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community. Be particularly careful when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them. 

There is no conspiracy to silence these claims.  This account is problematic because Twain's work seems to indicate that the 350,000 people do not exist in Twain's time, or that there are much less people than 350,000 living in Palestine.  Verified and peer-reviewed sources indicate that there were 350,000 people in the area concomitant to Twain's visit.  Thats what needs to be said in a section on demographics, not the musings of a satirist and fiction author.

Self-published sources

Main article: Wikipedia:VerifiabilityA self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It includes personal websites, and books published by vanity presses. Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources.Exceptions to this may be when a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise Twain's work is also in breech of this portion of WP:RS as well.  His accounts cannot be considered verified or subject to any form of independent fact-checking.  He is also not a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise.

If we were doing original research or if we did not have good population estimates, then this information would be valuable. Since There are no accurate estimates of population at the time so laregely scholars can relate to the observations of travelers at the time'' is clearly wrong and we do have accurate estimates of population at the time, it is clear that we need to use these and expunge the article of all non-scholarly sources, including the Herbert Samuel link I contributed earler.",0

"""==Subalpine Fir==
Hi Walter - thanks! very nice pics again -) I'm doing very little on wiki just at the mo, my computer seems set to expire, keeps on freezing in mid-type . . grrrr! (so if I disappear that's why). Nootka Cypress has been reclassified recently, you'll find it at Callitropsis nootkatensis now (the reasons for the change are outlined there) -  
Thank you. I've put Nootka Cypress in the proper category, now. I'm sorry to hear of your computer woes. Best wishes.  
Thanks! Been wondering - do you have any opinion on whether it would be better to have Subalpine Fir at one page or two?: the two species split used by Fl. N. Amer. is far from universally accepted (e.g. USDA don't accept it). I was thinking of (a) moving the present page to just 'Subalpine Fir', and (b) expanding on the one/two species discussion, to make a page similar to that for White Fir (also split into two species by Fl. N. Amer.), or the coverage of Alpine Spruce at Norway Spruce. Let me know what you think -  
I think that is a good proposal and support it. Pojar (op. cit.) does much the same and it works well. Coast Range Subalpine Fir and Rocky Mountains Subalpine Fir would be replaced by redirects to help those unfamiliar with the issue.
Will do, computer permitting! (just now, it seems to need 2 hours cool-off time for every half hour of working before it goes on the blink - yet a temperature indicator says it isn't overheating)
Hmmm - needs an admin to do it; I'll give Guettarda a buzz -   Addenum - Guettarda's done it now, I'll start working on the page -  
I thought the White Fir and Norway Spruce articles were very good.
Thanks! -)
Some redirects for the White Fir and Norway Spruce common names seem to be missing. Is this intentional?
No, my oversight - I'm forever forgetting to do all the necessary redirects. By all means add any you see missing!
Do you have plans to work on Abies amabilis anytime soon? It is the dominant mid-elevation species west of the Cascade crest in Washington, often with only small number of other individuals, mostly Thuja plicata and Tsuga heterophylia.
Yes, again computer permitting; for pics I've got a studio closeup of some foliage (useful to show the dense pubescence) but a pic or two (or three or four ...!) from the wild would be brilliant. Any options on getting cones, or is it a poor crop this year?
Your suggestions of image subjects from Washington are welcome.
Any are welcome! If there's lots, they can always go in ... format. Outsize trees are nice, but typical 'average' mature specimens are also perhaps better for an encyclopedia (I liked the Whitebark Pine pic in that respect), and shots of foliage + cones. Vine Maple would be good too, there's already a PD pic from the USDA, but it's very low res and could do with replacing, ditto for several other broadleaves too. And Taxus brevifolia (only very low res PD pic at the mo).
Best wishes,  
Thanks again! -  

Thank you for the image suggestions. I think that I can get some of them soon.
Thought of another - Grand Fir could do with a tree pic - 
Perhaps the giant tree images could go into a new article Giant Trees or something similar, eventually.
Someone else suggested that too, by moving the ==Champion trees== section out of Tree to its own page; it might be a good idea - 
Why not request admin status? I'd be happy to suggest it, if you prefer.  
Thanks! I may do yet, Guettarda is also suggesting it -

Hi Walter - done now, awaiting a pic for the taxobox and any more details I've omitted! -  
Excellent article. I like the illustrations you found, especially the closeup of the lower surface. I spent several hours looking through thousands of images without finding any that are suitable. Either the trees/foliage are incidental to the image or the identity of the species is uncertain. Now that I have a good reason to go on a photography expedition, the weather has turned bad. Snow is forecast down to 4 to 5000' in the next few days. It is our first significant storm of the fall. When it improves, I'll try to",0

I could also bring sources like uwarzamrze.pl, wpolityce.pl, wprost.pl, onet.pl and many others. But niezalezna.pl seems to provide the most of information on that investigation, the most detailed. You can always say they are political, right-wing, etc., and you can always call every investigation of any crime a “political game” because there is almost always someone who could benefit on it… But there is an interesting thing: If the Law and Justice party and all the “right-wing extremists” are pushing a fake-theory of an assassination, then why they are all demanding an international investigation on it and all the others are so afraid of it? What do they have to hide? Why the Law and Justice party runs the risk of an international shame and loss of all the voters support if it was really an accident? 
What you are trying to defend here is a theory of a ghost-plane flying under the ground, smashed by one of the armored birches that grow only in Russia… And you don’t say it’s a fringe, conspiracy theory, it’s an official, true version! Just because the terrorists ruling in Russia (responsible for many other political murders – will you deny that?) said so, because they led an investigation on it and the Polish government confirmed it and all the mainstream media repeated it and then all the international media repeated after them (what else should they do?). And the only other investigation with a rational conclusion with a hypothesis of explosions is a “fringe theory” that has to be removed...  Also one thing I have to add here: do you know anything about the war between Georgia and Russia in 2008 and the role of L. Kaczynski there? Do you know that he gathered four other countries leaders (Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Latvia), went to Tbilisi and forced Russian army to stop the attack on Georgia? See:  Do you know there was already an assassination attempt on him right there, in Georgia? See: . Do you know that the Katyn_massacre was also a revenge? 
However, after all, I’m glad that you finally focused on merits and try to find some other explanation for the explosions, that about the fuel tanks. (then the official reports must be lies, too.) As I know, the fuel has to be mixed with air/oxygen in some proportion to explode, otherwise, with a surface-contact with air, it fires slowly. However, It is all to be investigate by an international commission. And, about the balance in the article, the only reliable theory is about 5% of contents and you say it’s too much...",0

Hi there, since you do not wish to have a united article representing all point of views and would like to stick to your point of view, I have no rights to prevent you other than that of a fellow wikipedian from South Asia. I have divided both the pages under discussion into two parts. One for Government point of view and one for refugee point of view. Since there is no neutral or united point of view, I will not be editing or discussing in those pages as actively as I have been doing. Besides, I can not prepare for my exams with no other than my fellow South Asian accusing me of fancy accusitions in place no other than wikipedia.

FYI, if they’re not from Nepal, it could be they are from india also, ie, not necessarily from Bhutan. being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed. you can count the number of poor nepalese without any documents who are finding their way to india every day. if ever there was a census to be done between nepal and india, you will find millions ‘stateless’ by your definition, definitely in the hundreds of thousands. is bhutan responsible for that? is it inconceivable to you that some of them might have made their way to bhutan? You conclude that it is 'entirely a Bhutanese issue' and nothing could be further from the truth.

Please do not comment about Nepalese press in a nation where it has played a major part in bringing a revolution from a nation where there is virtually no press. The press here is not garbage.

I do not have a point of view. I agree that I have made some points which were offensive to some, but it was not intentional and were derived from the data. There was a speculation which was corrected later. I just posted what were there in websites of UNHCR and other global organizations which is something that is done in wikipedia. I have told you that people of Nepalese origin are found throughout the world. Many might be stateless. However, the reports of UNHCR shows otherwise in case of Bhutanese refugees. If you can change their view, please do. Otherwise stop editing with whatever you wish to write or in your own words, stop garbaging wikipedia.

"""==Notability of Benjamin Herrold==
 A tag has been placed on Benjamin Herrold requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Why Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism

By lsanger in Op-Ed
Fri Dec 31, 2004 at 12:42:24 AM EST
Tags: Internet (all tags) TABInternet
TAB

Wikipedia has started to hit the big time. Accordingly, several critical articles have come out, including """"The Faith-Based Encyclopedia"""" by a former editor-in-chief of Britannica and a very widely-syndicated AP article that was given such titles as """"When Information Access Is So Easy, Truth Can Be Elusive"""".

These articles are written by people who appear not to appreciate the merits of Wikipedia fully. I do, however; I co-founded Wikipedia. (I have since left the project.)

Wikipedia does have two big problems, and attention to them is long overdue. These problems could be eliminated by eliminating a single root problem. If the project's managers are not willing to solve it, I fear a fork (a new edition under new management, for the non-techies reading this) will probably be necessary.

TAB
TAB
Let me preface this by saying that I know Wikipedia is very cool. A lot of people do not think so, but of course they are wrong. So the following must be taken in the spirit of someone who knows and supports the mission and broad policy outlines of Wikipedia very well.

First problem: lack of public perception of credibility, particularly in areas of detail. The problem I would like to point out is not that Wikipedia is unreliable. The alleged unreliability of Wikipedia is something that the above (TechCentralStation and AP) articles make much of, but that is not my point, and I am not interested in discussing that point per se.

My point is that, regardless of whether Wikipedia actually is more or less reliable than the average encyclopedia, it is not perceived as adequately reliable by many librarians, teachers, and academics. The reason for this is not far to seek: those librarians etc. note that anybody can contribute and that there are no traditional review processes. You might hasten to reply that it does work nonetheless, and I would agree with you to a large extent, but your assurances will not put this concern to rest.

You might maintain that people are already using Wikipedia a lot, and that that implies a great deal of trust. This is true, as far as it goes; but people use many sources that they themselves believe to be unreliable, via Google searches, for example. (I do so all the time, though perhaps I shouldn't.) Perhaps Wikipedia is better described as one of those sources regarded as unreliable which people read anyway. And in this case, one might say, there's no problem: Wikipedia is being read, and it is of minimally adequate and increasing reliability. What more could you ask? In other words, why does a perception of unreliability matter?

I am willing to grant much of this reply. I think merely that there are a great many benefits that accrue from robust credibility to the public. One benefit, but only one, is support and participation by academia. I am on the academic job market now and I felt it was necessary to explain my views about Wikipedia's credibility for potential employers. A great many of my colleagues are not at all impressed with the project; but more about that in a bit.

Another benefit accruing from robust public credibility is even more widespread use and support by teachers, schools, libraries, and the general publicprecisely the people who want to use what they believe to be a credible encyclopedia. To the extent that the project is not reaching, and being supported by, these people, it is not succeeding as well as it might.

Perhaps you might also maintain that, while Wikipedia does not now have a reputation for reliability, it will eventually, once enough studies proving its reliability are done, and once people are more familiar with the concept behind the project. This is hard to argue with; but it is also hard to support, because it involves predicting the future, and the future, when it comes to public opinion, is extremely unpredictable. It would be better to do something to help guarantee a reputation for reliability.

Wikipedia has another sort of credibility problem, mentioned in passing above, and I fear that time is not a solution to this problem, the way it might be to the foregoing one. Namely, one can make a good case that, when it comes to relatively specialized topics (outside of the interests of most of the contributors), the project's credibility is very uneven. If the project was lucky enough to have a writer or two well-informed about some specialized subject, and if their work was not degraded in quality by the majority of people, whose knowledge of the subject is based on paragraphs in books and mere mentions in college class",0

Thanks for your comments. They were very encouraging. We're hoping to go again at FAC in the next few days. 

The way I got involved with this article was that I opposed it at its last FAC about a month ago, felt guilty, and realised that I could probably meet my own objections, if I rolled my sleeves up. The links are just about last on the list of things to do: one goes down tunnels in this article and loses a sense of the overall warren. They are pains in the arse, though, especially things like Henry IV, I, 2, 3, plus the fact that Shakespeare unhelpfully named his plays after a bunch of Wikipedia articles.

I'm a history man, really, which is probably why the tragedy stuff comes over cacklike. It's hellish, though, trying to sum up 38 plays in four paragraphs, and I've probably relied too much on my Bradley. Fortinbras does march on after the Hamlet bloodbath to herald the new order, though. Anyway, I will try a rewrite at that point, """"lest more mischance on plots and errors happen"""". """,0

 What are you talking about? 

Excuse me, I have no idea what you are talking about.  What do you mean by """"stalking""""?  I came across The Intruder and thought I could make it a little better.  I reorganized it, put in headings, added some wikilinks, deleted your signature (unlike blogs, Wikipedia editors don't sign articles), and took out some clear violations of WP:NPOV.  How is this stalking?  I haven't followed you around to any articles you have edited and vandalized them.  I don't recall how I came upon the article, my contributions list show it was just after some vandalism reverts  where I often find articles of interest, whether vandalized or not.

Many editors with blogging background don't realize that article listings for movies, books, theatre, etc. are not reviews.  Such quotes as, """"'The Intruder' contains William Shatner's best and bravest lead role, played to the hilt, and the hilt disappears into Adam Cramer,"""" are perfectly fine in a review, but not in Wikipedia.  You might want to read Wikipedia policy concerning original research.  If you can find similar sentiments in the print media or other such source, then, by all means, add it and reference it.  Don't worry about getting the format correct, put the information in the article and other editors will fix it up to conform to Wikipedia's manual of style.  You might want to look at other articles for movies to get a feel for the format.  Eventually, the """"original research"""" part of your contribution will be deleted.  If not by me, then by another editor.  I've found it better to anticipate that and write my articles accordingly.

As for Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/What Really Happened (2nd nomination), I made my comments and have moved on.  Lots of editors make comments on deletion articles every day.  I have commented on several hundred AfDs (Articles for Deletion).  For the most part, I don't recall what any individual says 5 minutes after I click the save button.  Sorry, but I don't recall your comment, nor whether you are for or against deletion (although, I presume you took the opposite stance from me).  I read enough to get a feel for the arguments, did some research, and came to a decision.  In the past I have pushed delete and the articles were kept.  Other times I pushed for keep and the articles were deleted.  That is the nature of AfD.

They did the same thing a while back, and their website uses that designation.  Berkely is the same way.  It is technically UC Berkeley, but that isn't what you see on their website.

It would not be surprising that anything from SUNY head office or whatever it is would continue to use the old designation, but that is politics, and is hardly an area we need to play to here.

I really don't care all that much about the Jewish lists and categories.  I've voted on some of them, mostly because other editors have solicited my input (I think with more confidence in what I would opine than is merited).  My votes on those have been mixed, and have depended on how specific the topics are, and whether I think they can be done in an encyclopedic fashion.  But I'm neither one of those people who votes """"keep"""" for anything with the word """"Jewish"""" in it; nor am I an editor who votes """"delete"""" whenever I see the word (we have some of each, and I think both are acting with a bit of bad faith).

I am, however, very offended by abuse of the administrative systems of WP in violation of WP:POINT.  I guess you're a newbie, and are perhaps not entirely aware of procedures.  We all start out that way.  In actual fact, there is a """"criteria for speedy deletion"""" that allows removal of pages that have been previously deleted by AfD.  There are a lot of rules floating around, and they are not all consistent with each other, so you can certainly be forgiven for not knowing all, or even most, of them.

But an AfD is for a very specific thing, and something very different from your spurious nomination.  FWIW, Arniep also violated WP:POINT by massively nominating """"Jewish Foo"""" lists that he actually wanted kept.  And he got blocked for 48 hours (rightly) as a warning.  What an AfD is for is to get a page that you genuinely think fails to cover an encyclopedic topic removed from Wikipedia.  It is not a way to express displeasure with particular editors of that page.  It is not a way to push the idea that the page would be better if modified in some fashion.  And it is not a way to get even with editors who voted """"delete"""" on some other page that you believe is conceptually equivalent to the page you nominate.

There are lots of pages that I think should be better, and where I think the editors are putting in material that is not encyclopedic, and where the structure of the article is not optimal (maybe it needs refactoring into subpages).  As a good WP citizen who follows Wikiquette, I raise those issues on the article talk pages.  I attempt edits to the page directly.  Perhaps I create a temporary version of the page that more closely fits what I think it should be like.  What I do not do is nominate pages that I think cover worthwhile topics for AfD as a way of bullying the editors whose edits I do not like.

If you follow Wikiquette, you'll get along with people here, and be a productive editor.  If you violate it, you'll make lots of enemies, increase general animosity, and fail to get anything done.

(LauraHale has already declined, and as I've promised to obtain that independent review, I need to find someone to do it.) Thank you.",0
"No worries, it's understandable considering that your changes take some time to do. I don't know if you're Wikignoming because you lack the time or resources to expand articles or if it's just something you prefer to do, but there's certainly other stuff that you can be profitably be doing. Ship article titles need to have the ship's name in italics or you could focus on improving their categorization, neither of which I tend to remember to do anything about. Adding convert templates to articles is certainly worthwhile, although I'd suggest you limit your preference for always abbreviating everything. For one thing, I like to show the hyphen form of a compound adjective like 15-inch gun, something that abbreviating eliminates. You could ensure that articles written in AmEnglish use American spelling of units and vice versa; just be sure not to change the type of English unless there are strong national connections like RN ships use BritEng or USN ships use AmEng. Articles on non-English speaking navies' ships have no national connection and can be written in either form; just be sure that it's consistent within the article. And if you'd like to write a ship article, I'd be happy to help as I have a pretty large library; so much so that I don't really consider Jane's Fighting Ships as a top tier resource. Lemme know what you'd like to do and I'm willing to help or provide advice.",0

"Malabarian Jewish - Nasrani tradition

Hi Veliath, you are right the page Nasrani should be redirected to the page Syrian malabar nasrani, or to the page Syriac Christianity.

it was originally redirected to Syriac Christianity but several vandals tampered with the pages on syrian malabar nasrani and st thomas christians. In fact there was an entire section on st thomas christians explaining its nasrani context which was systematically destroyed by vandals. Instead they wrote in factually inaccurate statements about the st thomas christians being marathas and telegu which is still there on the page Saint Thomas Christians.

here I post to you the passages destroyed by the vandals:

>>>>>

This article deals with the Saint Thomas Christian churches and denominations of the Nasrani people

The Saint Thomas Christians (Malayalam: Nasrani) are a group of Christians from the Malabar coast (now Kerala) in South India, who follow Syriac Christianity. The different groups and denominations within the St Thomas Christians together form the Nasrani people. Their tradition goes back to the very beginnings of first century Christian thought, and the seven churches that are believed to have been established by St. Thomas the Apostle.

Nasrani and Saint Thomas Christian tradition

The Nasranis are an ethnic people and in that sense a single community. However the Nasranis have various denominations as a result of Portuguese persecution. As an ethnic community they refer to themselves as Nasranis referring to the common cultural heritage and cultural tradition. However as a religious group they refer to themselves as the Mar Thoma Khristianis or in English as Saint Thomas Christians referring to the various and diverse religious denominations between them in terms of their religious tradition, despite a common ancestory of being the descendants of the early Mar Thoma church or Saint Thomas tradition of Christianity.

These first century churches, according to tradition, were, from north to south: Palayoor near Guruvayoor/Kunnankulam, Cranganore (believed to be the ancient Muziris of Pliny, and the Periplus, on the north bank of Periyar River today), Paravoor on the south side of Periyar, Gokkamangalam or Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Chayal or Nilakkal (the only inland church) and the Lakes or Kaayals, and finally Kollam. The visit of the Apostle Thomas to these places and to Mylapore on the East coast of India can be read in the Ramban Song of Thomas Ramban, set into modern writing c. 1500.

Getaway: Thank you for your comments. I most certainly did give my reasons  Read my previous comment. What you didn't do is raise any points on the discussion page before making changes. As for your charges:

1) FAIR and Media Matters are certainly media watchdogs, even though they're political. All media watchdogs are political. Rush Limbaugh is political. That doesn't make any of their views invalid, but it does call for balance. 

2) Phrases like """"axe to grind"""" serve no function in intelligent debate. It would be equally pointless to argue that Limbaugh has an """"axe to grind."""" He does, and I don't have a problem with that. He has every right to have an axe to grind here in the land of free speech, and so do FAIR and Media Matters. Having an axe to grind is just one way to say somebody takes a certain political position. Limbaugh's positions are one POV of a partisan debate and FAIR's are another. Their axes, excuse me, their views need to be balanced. By the way, I don't know as much about Media Matters as about FAIR, but FAIR makes no claim to be """"neutral and nonpartisan"""" as you suggest. What they claim is to be accurate. You're welcome to challenge that accuracy, with sources. Which leads to my next point:

3) It's very easy to toss out weasel words like """"MM and FAIR both have long records of inaccuracy"""" but you're not providing any evidence that their charges against Limbaugh are fallacious or inaccurate. Judging from Limbaugh's feeble response to FAIR's charges, we might be tempted to conclude that Limbaugh can't answer FAIR because FAIR got it right. If there's a problem with FAIR's accuracy, you're welcome to include it, with sources, in the paragraph. (I've issued this invitation three times already and nobody has taken me up on it.) But you do not get to blindly assert that FAIR isn't a credible source without any evidence to back you up, and you don't get to water down what I've written just because you don't like FAIR's work or because you can't find sources to back up your position.

4) FAIR isn't merely expressing opinion. It's documenting errors of fact. Please don't confuse opinion with fact, they're not the same thing at all. When Limbaugh claims that suspending rules on minority hiring will make earthquake repairs go quickly, he's stating an opinion. But when Limbaugh says the government suspended rules on minority hiring, he's making a statement of fact. FAIR is taking issue with Limbaugh's facts. 

5) I'm not asking for special treatment for FAIR. I'm asking that, as per NPOV rules, their view get equal treatment. Are you asking for special treatment for Limbaugh's views? 

6) Please focus on substance? I am. I feel it's important to provide a historical perspective on this controversy, and I feel the article needs to illustrate of the depth and scope of the controversy, which is provided by the Media Matters quote. I also feel this section needs a defining introductory sentence. For these reasons, I'm restoring much of the previous text. If you disagree, please take issue with me on this page. 

BTW I feel that Allen3 made a useful clarifying edit in an earlier revision, when he labeled FAIR a """"progressive"""" organization, and provided a link to an article. I find that much more accurate than """"Liberal,"""" since FAIR keeps its distance from classic liberalism, and sometimes takes issue with people who call themselves Liberal. Can we keep the """"Progressive"""" label?  """,0

"In Re Abuse of Dr. Larry Sanger
I have opted to retire forever from this project and join the more credible project of Citizendium, where my new Associate of Science degree in Human Development might actually be useful to me as an editor in the areas of psychology and human development and counseling theories.

Dr. Larry Sanger's claim to co-foundership here is more credible than your claims of sole credit, and no not because he's the doctorate holder and you're not. I believe him because he reads more to me in my judgment more authentic about his feelings and he's more a straight shooter than you.

"Randolph, Tennessee 

Hey, how is it going? I am kind of stuck with a question about the population of a small place, and as I know that you deal with unincorporated small places sometimes I thought to drop you a line. I started that article about Randolph, Tennessee recently and I am so far pretty amazed that there is a lot of documented historical information to find about that place. Funny, if enough time passes, even about the smallest places there is something to say. Well, what I could not find out about is any recent population. As a matter of fact, I have a referenced population for 1820 (54), shortly before foundation of the town. And I have one good enough estimate for 1834 (1,000). In 1861 they had 5,000 soldiers there, but that does not really count as population, does it? Today it might be in the few hundreds, not much more. It looks like any population more recent than 1834 would be of great help here already.

I tried to find out about the voting precincts, but Randolph is included in the same voting precinct (14 S.W. Tipton) with a few other, larger communities. So you can't really start from there.

 News suppressed on Wikipedia http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

RexCurry.net is the historian who made the following discoveries covered elsewhere and on Wikipedia:

1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist.""""
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.

As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.

Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.

Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their """"Nationalist"""" and """"New Nation"""" magazines, the """"Nationalist Educational Association"""" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book """"Looking Backward"""" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.

In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  

After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.

Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, and he preached what he called """"military socialism.""""  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.

The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the """"Wholecaust"""" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'",0

"Marriage
The reference to a same-sex marriage was removed. Whilst I understand why, I think it is also important that the matter is made clear to anyone who is new to either author. The article does not make it clear that C J Cherryh is also female. I have therefore entered 'same-sex' to qualify the domestic partnership. 

Also, whilst marriage is legally,in some places, equally available to same-sex or hetreosexual couples, not everyone believes that in religious terms the two unions are equal. The view of those people also deserves to be respected as well as other views. I have therefore qualified the term 'marriage' with 'legal'.",0

""":, please consider my beer analogy again.  It would be quite easy to find reliable sources saying that beer is made from malt, hops, yeast, and water.  Many people think this is the only way true beer should be made.  Nevertheless some people do make beer out of other ingredients.  Now it might be correct to say that 'traditional ale' is made only of these ingredients and it is certainly true that beer made according to the """"Bavarian Purity Law"""" should be made from only these ingredients.  

Is there no way you can temper your claim and also make it strictly more accurate and informative by saying something like 'traditional Korean kimchi is always fermented'.   

To:User:Martin Hogbin: Look. I would do it if it were true to my knowledge and/or there existed some reliable sources to confirm that. The saveur.com article, the only source against my claim that I consider at least semi-reliable, says """"It can also be eaten before it is allowed to ferment"""". Do you think this confirms the existence of unfermented kimchi against all sources I gathered? Someone might like to have a bite of Sauerkraut before it is fermented. 
I don't want to argue with you or something, but I have heard that beer is made from only malt, hops, and water in Germany (as it should be). Unfortunately, at least in Korea, Japan, and the U.S., most beer includes rice, potato, corn starch, and many other ingredients I think unnecessary. At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.
But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled """"unfermented"""", maybe except for Japanses """"kimuchi"""" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.) Nevertheless, I am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented.

"Heaven of God 

To understand Heaven, then God must be understood:
 1.  God is the all powerful supreme being of the Universe.  
 2.  Universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen, and defined as everything known and unknown.  Any concept of a multi-universe shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces, but only one Universe.  A mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions.  The subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace.  The subspace that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself.  The Universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions.
 3.  God is either above the Universe as the creator, or part of some subspace of the Universe, or both above and part of the Universe.  The fourth condition that God is not part of the Universe, and God is not above the Universe negates God's existence; therefore, the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of God.
 4.  God is supreme over the Universe.  It is God's creation and obeys God's rules.  Each rule can be obvious or non-obvious, and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known.
 5.  God has the ability to create and destroy energy.  Without such a thing, then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist; there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition, but God's energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy.
 6.  God is smart, is intelligent, is wise, has knowledge, is a creator, is good, is benevolent, has mercy, and has understanding.  God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe.  
 7.  God expects God's creation to do well, since as a creator, then the Universe was created for God's purpose and enjoyment; therefore, life elements of God's creation, such as people, are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom, understanding, and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good.
 8.  Because God is supreme, then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God.
 9.  God not only deals with people of Earth of our Sol system of the Milky Way galaxy, God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole, or God can interact with the Universe in part; therefore, God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life, and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important.  
10.  It is always believed that God likes people, so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer.
11.  God likes to be acknowledged from God's own creation, so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe.
12.  Love God.  Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society, family, nation, benevolence, and many good things of life.  Be who you are as a person and love God, and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people. 

God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way.  Each person can get a personal Heaven, or Heaven may be a interaction for people, or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people.  Heaven is always defined as a good place; but, a personal Heaven can also be a personal Hell tailored to your life, attitude, and existence where God could give us, by observation, an environment where the individual prospered.  The personal Heaven and Hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants, but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm, and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive, and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy (visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species).

God can define Heaven in any way, and Heaven is defined as a good place, but as a supreme being God can allow many things, and maybe God might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm, so the possibilities of Heaven are expected to be many, if not endless possibilities.  God is benevolent in Heaven and the possibilities are many.  Love God.",0

"Why include Peter and Emerich?==

Peter the Hermit and Emerich's respective endeavours really have nothing to do with the actual First Crusade that was led by Godfrey, Raymond and Bohemond. Emerich in particular is totally unrelated, since he was a psychotic murderer who wasn't following the Church's teachings. Bishop Rothgard of Mainz tried to protect his Jewish neighbors from him. At any rate, discussions of Peter the Hermit and Count Emerich should have their own articles. This should be about the actual First Crusade that took Jerusalem.

 One More Stab at Making the Article Neutral  
I have inserted a passage that is identical to a passage from the """"homophobia"""" article. It merely replaces the word """"homosexuality"""" with """"transexuality/transexualism"""". There is absolutely no reason to keep this passage out - other then to provide the article with a liberally slanted viewpoint. It is more difficult to find a citation for opposition to use of the word """"transphobia"""" than it is to find a citation for opposition to the use of the word """"homophobia"""" simply because most people don't even know this word exists. Common sense, however, makes it clear that opposition does exist for the same reasons.
Depsite changes to the article, it still remains nothing but an unsourced opinionated opening section, which is then followed by a list of unfortunate incidents. That's not an ecncylopedia article. That's a political pamphlet. With this addition, I believe that we can at least make the article reasonably neutral in the same way that it seems to have made the """"homophobia"""" article neutral.

I am sick to death of your continual WP:SOAPboxing on this talkpage and will simply delete or revert (rather than archiving  as you simply remove the archive templates) any further irrelevant material. ''TalkStalk''(P)

Here is the statement on WP:SOAP
Wikipedia is not a soapbox, a battleground, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. This applies to articles, categories, templates, talk page discussions, and user pages. Therefore, content hosted in Wikipedia is not:

Propaganda, advocacy, or recruitment of any kind, commercial, political, religious, or otherwise. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view. You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.[1] 

Opinion pieces. Although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to """"climb soapboxes"""" (i.e. passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced to put entries, especially for current events, in a reasonable perspective, and represent a neutral point of view. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete. However, Wikipedia's sister project Wikinews allows commentaries on its articles. 

Scandal mongering or gossip. Articles about living people are required to meet an especially high standard, as they may otherwise be libellous or infringe the subjects' right to privacy. Articles should not be written purely to attack the reputation of another person. 

Self-promotion. It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects in which you have a strong personal involvement. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself or about projects close to you. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest. 
Advertising. Articles about companies and products are written in an objective and unbiased style. Article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small """"garage"""" or local companies are typically unacceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they identify major organizations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Wikipedia neither endorses organizations nor runs affiliate programs. See also Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies) for guidelines on corporate notability. Those promoting causes or events, or issuing public service announcements, even if noncommercial, should use a forum other than Wikipedia to do so. 

Clearly I have not tried to recruit, sell, gossip or self-promote.  The opinion peices are clearly talking about article and not discussion pages and are stated as such. The opinion I have stated are backed up with facts and hence on the discussion page.  Please enlighten me with what definiton of WP:SOAP you are using.

 Corrections to discussion about sky glow in LP page and in main sky glow page. 

1. Light is scattered by molecules (Rayleigh scattering) and aerosols - not """"refracted.""""
2. Aerosol scattering dominates in most places - in """"clear ir"""" (see Garstang, 1986, PASP), the total scattering from aerosols is ~10x that from molecules.
3. Aerosol scattering has almost no wavelength dependence, reducing the dominance of blue light influence below that expected from pure Rayleigh scattering and the RSI of Keith.
4. But, the Purkinje effect makes the eye more sensitive to white/blue rich light when dark adapted (most relevant when looking at/adapted to sky glow; only marginally relevant when looking at/adapted to outdoor night lighting levels), increasing again the dominance of white/blue-rich sources.
5. The Bortle scale has made very little or no penetration into professional astronomy - astronomers, when they characterize skyglow at all, still use mag/arcsec2.  Bortle scale is being used by amateurs and is being investigated in some detail by US National Park Service as a useful scale to characterize night sky quality.  Finally, the Bortle scale uses much more than just sky glow to characterize skies.

I wanted to be a touch more exact on some of the parts for Mugen’s character. He’s such an interesting character that even though he is almost purely made up out of the minds of the creators, he still has a few bits of actual historical pertinence to him.

The part I’m addressing now is the interesting way in which he comes back to life by meeting the “Shamans” as referred to in his character profile. In the Okinawan belief system, these shamans are called “futuki” and they are the only spirits from the other world who intercede into human affairs.

These beings are generally thought to be an individual's own direct ancestors (both male and female), and the same individual's future descendants (which makes it kind of interesting that Mugen has a center place in the ongoing line of them; maybe there is something to the theory that Spike is his descendant...). Anyway, the futuki are generally masked and wear feathered cloaks, and are indistinguishable from each other, at least in this world. During one of the many interesting flashback montage’s, we see not only the long line of them, but one watching Mugen from the road through the forest, and a couple of other spots, which suggests to me that he's someone they're keeping an eye on. It would make sense by traditional Okinawan beliefs but it is pure speculation on my part.

The feathered apparel particularly have always made me wonder about that tropical looking red bird that seems to observe Mugen so closely in that grove; maybe another spirit observer? And it might also be interesting to note that the underworld where he deals with the futuki, Nirai-kanai, is represented in Okinawan folklore as an island you can only reach by swimming underwater; if you try to sail there it'll always be on the horizon no matter how far you go. I think that's why everything there appears upside down, you have to """"sink to rise"""" there, so to speak; and Mugen """"falls back to the surface"""" when he leaves that place.

I know this is an encyclopedia but a lot of that info couldn’t be found here, so I just wanted to put it here to get some feedback on what other people think.   """,0

 A reaction to the above comment 

Some good points here, some of which are accounted for very well on the page about the SWP US. It seems better that this entry on Barnes remain focussed on Barnes himself rather than the SWP.
DICTATORSHIP OR DEMOCRACY - It's an excellent point to say that it's pointless and misleading to demonise Barnes. Clearly, there was a qualitative change in the politics of the SWP during the 1980s. Barnes clearly played a leading role in this process, but had the national committee majority behind him. Most would also say that the SWP organisational and democratic norms changed: those who were expelled, such as the Fourth International Tendency, argued it was done undemocratically and wrong-headedly.
BREAKING WITH TROTSKYISM - This seems a fair description of the SWP's evolution. However, if the SWP feel it unfair, it would be better to write of a """"break with Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution and the struggle to build the Fourth International."""" In so far as Trotsky agrees with the Leninism, and opposition to Stalinism and the third period, the SWP agree with him. However, Trotskyism clearly refers to the politics of the movement that Trotsky and the SWP founded: the FI. The defining aspects of that movement: permanent revolution in the developing world; anti-bureaucratic revolution in the workers' states and the notion of socialist democracy. Of course, the SWP no longer calls itself Trotskyist and the word is dropped, for example, from the title of Joseph Hansen's book on Cuba.
CASTROISM - Similary, it is mistaken to call the SWP a Castoist party. The SWP's 'New International' strategy in the 1980s and 1990s was one of convergence with the Castroist current. However, it's clear that the SWP has its own ideology.

Well what I was trying to explain is that I never make any personal statements about him (with the exception of """"to promote a positive image of Iran and Iranians"""", which, as I explained later in the same section, any person assuming good faith would take as an insult). You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one, personally pointing me out by name. I never did anything comparable to this. Is this in accordance with your policy of """"we discuss articles, not users""""???? 

As for the unsourced tag, it's been discussed in the talk page. The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article. All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups, but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page. The article is on Iranian peoples, so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are. Such a source has yet to be provided. 

I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages, but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings (Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group, that of """"Iranian peoples"""" - see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this). I'm not sure what's the best way to move on from here. The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind, but a lot of users are not being cooperative.

"""I am removing the following section for two reasons:

""""Some anthropologists and sociologists are critical of the method because it measures personality traits on a basis of its synonymous adjectives in the English language, thus overlooking possible cultural construction of language. That English alone was used in factor analysis also arguably demonstrates an example of ethnocentrism. Furthermore, sociologists are critical that the theory only reinforces stereotypes and ignores social factors that might have lead to traits being present in certain groups of individuals. For instance, while women have a demonstrated tendency towards agreeableness, this is likely true of most subordinated individuals. Tying this trait to women at a psychological level then only reasserts inequalities by implying that differences exist as a matter of human nature rather than as a result of the social construction of gender.""""

1. The information given there is incorrect. I've checked the scientific research to be sure, and English alone was *not* used in factor analysis, and the existence and nature of the Big Five factors has been validated in multiple continents. Here's an excerpt from McCrae & Hofstede's fascinating paper, Personality and Culture Revisited: Linking Traits and Dimensions of Culture (2004):

""""Research in the English-speaking world using the NEO-PI-R established that individual differences in the factors are stable throughout most of the adult life span; that self-reports generally agree with observer ratings; and that the five factors, as well as the more specific traits that define them, are strongly heritable. In the 1990s, researchers around the world began to develop translations 2 of the instrument, making cross-cultural research possible. A series of studies showed that much the same factor structure was found in a wide variety of cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997), that developmental trends in the mean levels of personality traits between adolescence and later
adulthood appeared to be universal (McCrae et al., 1999), and
that similar gender differences were found among cultures (Costa,
Terracciano, & McCrae, 2001).""""

Here are the relevant citations from the above; if you can find them, I suggest taking a look:

McCrae, R. R., & Costa, P. T., Jr. (1997). Personality trait structure as a human universal. American Psychologist, 52, 509-516.

McCrae, R. R., Costa, P. T., Jr., Lima, M. P., Simões, A., Ostendorf, F., Angleitner, A., et al. (1999). Age differences in personality across the adult life span: Parallels in five cultures. Developmental Psychology, 35, 466-477.

Costa, P. T., Jr., Terracciano, A., &McCrae;, R. R. (2001). Gender differences in personality traits across cultures: Robust and surprising findings. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, 322-331.

As a further note in this regard, one group of subordinated individuals - prisoners - show personality profiles with low Agreeableness scores. Teenagers also show lower Agreeableness than adults. So I don't think it's """"likely true of most subordinated individuals"""" that they have high Agreeableness. In point of fact, it appears that Extroversion actually has more to do with social dominance than Agreeableness does. (And men score higher in the Assertiveness sub-scale of Extroversion, incidentally, as given in the last study cited above.)

2. Beyond being incorrect, I don't like the above statement because it demonstrates bias. The fact that psychometric research """"reinforces stereotypes"""" does not show that the research is bad or wrong; instead, it supports the truth to these stereotypes. Whether women are Agreeable because of genetic or environmental reasons is irrelevant to the question of whether Agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct. And of course while sociologists and anthropologists may be unhappy about these research results, that doesn't change the facts.

Hopefully this explanation is thorough enough to obviate the necessity of future arguments.

Clearly the point is biased in some direction; it is, after all, called criticism. However, it is appreciatable to rework claims rather than remove them entirely, as for example my move to redirect back the bias of your word """"discovered"""", implying a factual truth of the matter, back to the more neutral term identified, and my return of your loaded attempt of beginning the criticism section with """"While the general consensus favoring a five-factor model is strong, there is still dissention.""""

 Not sure what you are getting at here or the point your at attempting to make. (???) Hand loaders/ reloaders do not look at SAAMI/CIP when they create their own ammunition.  While I do not speak German, I can read and comprehend articles. Note I have in the past used German articles as references... if that is what you mean. I am still working on the article and remains incomplete. However, one does not look at an individual's reloaded data and give it credence from a Wikipedia standpoint. Factory manufactured ammunition should only be listed for illustrative purposes and for good reason, they respect a standard which is safe in a vast majority of caliber specific firearms. Conversely, if no standard is maintained for a given cartridge then data from reloading manuals should suffice. I am well aware that .325 WSM components are available in Europe, a cursory check on component sellers websites evidence this. BGO... However, I am certain that those reloading are not dragging pressure measuring instrumentation and pressure testing their ammunition against SAAMI or CIP standards.  Not sure what is being alluded to in the S&B; """"looks like... FMJ"""" but they do not manufacture 325 WSM ammo. 
 It is certain that the 325 WSM will become another also ran cartridge.  Certainly, rifle trends show that much. This was an 8mm cartridge designed from the US and Canadian markets and was a commercial flop from the beginning. But what does that have to do with anything in the end, really.  It is still a cartridge and should be treated in an objective manner on the Wiki - just like any other article. Yes the 8mm IS is established in Europe, and the 8mm RWS much less so but is hanging on, the 8 Rem Mag is dead and almost buried and .325 has both feet firmly planted in the the grave. So what...

"Paganism in Constantinople
I had a concern about the statement
Between 324 and 330, Constantine built ... a new imperial capital at Byzantium on the Bosphorus (it came to be named for him: Constantinople)–the city ... had no pagan temples.
I found a BBC article (see this link) that states
Constantine founded a new city named after himself: Constantinople. Christian writers played up the idea that this was to be a 'new Rome', a fitting Christian capital for a newly Christian empire.

But they had to find ways to explain the embarrassing fact that in this new, supposedly Christian city, Constantine had erected pagan temples and statues.

This is contrary to what I've always read but this is the BBC saying this. Interesting point to clarify. Can anybody comment on whether the BBC is simply in error or whether there might actually be some truth to this?",0

"Punti and Cantonese 

The term Cantonese is the result of poor transliteration in English. Canton is the English word for both Guangdong (province) and Guangzhou (provincial capital of Guangdong). When the word Canton is made into the English adjective Cantonese, it could mean Guangdongese and Guangzhouese. The language people commonly refer to as Cantonese is in fact Guangzhouese. Taishanese people speak Taishanese, a language that is unintelligible with Guangzhouese. Many Taishan people in China still do not speak or understand Guangzhouese. This is the norm in the whole of China concerning regional spoken languages. It is acceptable to say that Taishanese is one of the Guangdongese languages, but then so is Hakka. The conflict is thus not a conflict between a Cantonese (meaning Guangdongese) speaking people against a non-Cantonese speaking people as both peoples spoke Cantonese meaning Guangdongese, be it one spoke Taushanese and the other Hakka. Neither party could also be described as Cantonese (meaning Guangzhouese) speaking people as neither were Guangzhouese speakers at home.

If not about language differences, then what was the conflict about? The conflict was simply a conflict of economics. The Hakkas were seen as late comers who stole the show in a declining economy.",0

"Wow! My thought experiment has gotten you all fired up, it seems. -) 
In the case of the Trouton-Noble experiment, all the interactions involved are electromagnetic interactions. So once a theoretician has granted that in the physics of electromagnetism the Lorentz transformations apply, things can be taken from there.
Now, of course, Lorentz had to assume that a planet that is moving through the lorentzian ether is flattened in the direction of motion, just as everything else. That is a modification of how the force of gravity is transmitted.

 Coulomb force couples to electric charge, what does gravity couple to? 
 
But does the force of gravity couple to the rest mass, or to the total mass? If gravity couples only to the rest mass then the ether theory stands a chance of reproducing the prediction of the Einstein interpretation, as the rest mass is invariant under Lorentz transformation. But as far as we know gravitation involves the total mass. This is an illustration of the fact that in relativistic physics gravitation just bursts out of the confines of special relativity. Something has to give. 
This theme is similar, I think, to the theme in John Nortons paper about Nordström's Lorentz invariant scalar theory of gravitation; gravitation just bursts out of special relativity, and a successor to special relativity is needed. (And was provided by Einstein.) 

Poincaré's 1905 Palermo paper (facsimile reproduction, non-digital, 3 MB file) has a considerable section about gravitation. I'm not sure, but I don't think that Poincaré demands gravitational-inertial mass equivalence as a constraint on the theory. I think that if Poincaré had anticipated that light is deflected by gravitation, he would have written so. 
I think it was well after 1905 that recognition came that light does not only carry momentum, it also carries inertial mass. When light propagates from an emitter to a receiver, it not only transmits momentum, it also transmits inertial mass. The inertial mass of the emitter decreases on emission of the light, and the inertial mass of the receiver increases on absorption. Of course, light has zero rest mass. Since light has zero rest mass, the natural assumption is that light is not affected by gravity. 
Possibly, considerations of this nature made Poincaré very, very cautious towards attributing inertial mass to energy. 

In his 1909 Göttingen lecture, Poincaré went very far in attributing the increased inertia of a fast-moving electron to increased energy of the ether surrounding the electron, in response to the high velocity of the electrons. Can that still work for muons and tauon's? My understanding is that electrons and muons are identical as far as electric charge and spin are concerned, but that they are different in rest mass. Should electrons and muons become more and more alike at higher velocities? To my knowledge: at all velocities the energy of muons is the muon's rest mass multiplied with the relativistic factor.

I am indeed very curious how Lorentz dealt with these issues. As you indicate: historians of science describe that Lorentz retained a preference for using a lorentzian interpretation, but from the lectures Lorentz gave in the 1920ties it can be seen that Lorentz had full mathematical mastery of special and general relativity.  | Talk",0

"Help requested to mediate deletion of article Maurizio Giuliano

Dear Chair,

The above article has been the subject of changes and disputes, and finally it has been deleted.  I was involved in editing the article, and I honestly can disclose the fact that I know the subject of the article.  But I honestly don't feel that I am biased in favour of the article - though as a lawyer, I trust you can better see whether I am indeed objective as I claim to be.

To the best of my perception, most if not all the changes, and the deletion itself, saw the involvement of a specific user, whom I shall not mention out of courtesy.  I was surprised by the objections and changes made by the user, but did not object, and instead worked with him to solve the issue and improve my own objectivity.  We had some useful correspondence and I felt the issue was being addressed informally.

PROBLEM: Now however, the article has been deleted.  And I can see on the deletion discussion, that there was no consensus at all.  One specific user pushed for the deletion, and a decision was taken to delete, despite many votes to keep.  The discussion seems to me very biased against the subject of the article, and I note the following:

 The objector stated that his status as Guinness record holder is not proven.  The subject IS in the Guinness Book of World Records, 2006 edition, page 126 on the UK edition.  I can send a copy of the scanned page by email or upload it as may be requested.  I think this already makes him notable.  (The objector pointed out that some online media cited him as being 23 when he broke the record.  He was instead 28, and this is reflected correctly in the Guinness Book and in other media.  Some media just got it wrong.  I don't see why this should be relevant).

 Regarding his books, the subject published two books.  The objector claimed that these are self-published sources.  That is true.  But there is also plenty of third-party materials about his books, which you can find online.  So, he published two books which have been reviewed by others - he is an author.  I think this is enough for inclusion.

 Finally, the strangest thing: the objector disputes his notability as a UN official !  The issue here is that his status as a UN official was not even mentioned in the article - certainly not until I last saw it !  So, why did this become a topic for discussion ?  This makes me almost suspect that there may be a 'personal' element.

 Regarding other articles where he is cited...  The same user has also deleted his name - among many - from the article on the Centre for Social Studies, where there was a sentence stating that the Centre's published authors included him.  How can this be disputed ?  There is a book with ISBN etc. available on Amazon, clearly indicating that he is the author and the Centre is the publisher.  This should be sufficient proof of the fact that he is one of the Centre's published authors.

I hope you can resolve the dispute, and my ideal solution would be:
- The article is reinstated, and you can make any changes to it you deem appropriate.
- If there is anything substantial I object to or if I want to add new info, I shall contact you (or someone you might designate) instead of making changes directly.
- The one user who keeps objecting to the article should be asked to refrain from making changes directly, and instead go via you (or someone you might designate).

""":Hi. Lots of points, I'll reply as best I can:
Listing the squadrons and their aircraft types is too much /for this article/ but not too much for Wikipedia. Only listing the serial numbers, pilots or other minutiae is too much for Wikipedia. One way you could try would be to create a """"sandbox"""" page for yourself, say User:FFA P-16/Sandbox, write up the squadrons as best you can and then ask at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft‎ if we can look at it, tidy up the English, etc. and advise on the best page to put it on. Ground instruction airframes are not notable unless there is some special reason, for example if the airframe itself is notable from earlier in its life. 
Re. the ordering of the list, I would have to think about that but it is really a separate discussion. 
You say that the serial numbering (tail numbering) uses a special system. I would like to see this system explained, but it needs just a few examples to show the principles, not the whole list.
If Swiss writers routinely quote the serial number of an aircraft when writing about it, as a way of showing the information contained in the number, then you should be able to reference this. Such references might convince us that the Swiss Air Force is an exception to the general rule. We Wikipedia editors do like to see hard evidence, not just another editor's word. And, as you have noticed, we sadly know little of the Swiss Air Force unless someone can find reliable sources for us. — Cheers,  (Talk)

I protest not for the sake of arguing but for the sake of independence, for the sake of speech freedom, for the sake of liberty. I returned to Wikipedia with this account as I said in my first contribution that """"[t]he first course of action I must take is pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was blocked before I had settled that matter. I had not had the chance to become a constructive editor because I was not finished with my pursuit of justice. However, cum laude I left my streak on Bode Miller to the first sentence with my only mainspace edit. My contribution to that renowned, reformed skier will prevail for many years to come. My first argument against my block is that Jpgordon, an involved administrator, blocked me. This is an utter no-no on Wikipedia — an involved administrator, who himself is the epitome of most administrators (abusive, unkind, and unjust [not a personal attack]), blocking someone he dislikes. Through my praxeological observations, I have realized that Josh clearly demonstrates cui bono. By this unjust block, Wikipedia is regressing, I daresay, regressing into the reign of terror.

I propose that this block be dealt with in one of two of the following ways:
My block be reduced to one month, several months, or even a year. If I really am not a constructive editor, I wouldn't return. As devoted as I am, I will always strive to become useful here.
My block be lifted. I will strive to make constructive additions to Bode Miller and other great Olympians. I will refrain from editing any talk pages so that I will not have any chance to """"troll"""" or """"harass"""". If I ever start trolling again, block me forthwith. After a couple months, allow me to edit talk pages again so I can work to develop mutual understanding with my fellow Wikipedians. Once I do anything you do not like, block me. How much vandalism can I inflict when at least six administrators are watching me?

My last request is that an uninvolved administrator adjudicate between Jpgordon and me. , , ,  (for their posts on my talk page) and  and  (for their posts at the Administrators' noticeboard) are now involved, so please find an uninvolved administrator to review this. 

If you worry about my not being constructive if I am unblocked, I ask that whoever is handling this request exsert those worries. After having been blocked for """"[d]isruptive editing"""" on my previous account, I returned with this one. I returned to make amends. I returned to set right everything I disordered. I returned to assert my concerns. I returned with the hope of maintaining this stately encyclopedia, and I partially fulfilled this here. I would like to continue perfecting this great community. My last hope when I returned was to get blocked again, this time indefinitely, but instead to participate in the creation of an online encyclopedia destined to become the essence of Internet, the essence of knowledge, and the essence of perfection.

As Carl Rogers once said, """"If we value independence, if we are disturbed by the growing conformity of knowledge, of values, of attitudes, which our present system induces, then we may wish to set up conditions of learning which make for uniqueness, for self-direction, and for self-initiated learning"""". I believe just that and hope to introduce it to the Wikipedia community.

 Wikipedia inclusion guidelines 

Hi Florenta. Whilst I recognise that you are trying to do something nice for your friend by including him in Wikipedia, please be aware that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. We have guidelines and policies regarding what can and cannot be included; the most important of these is that subjects must be notable. For a simple explanation, see this page.

Dan Lake does not appear to meet the criteria for notability (he has not been the subject of substantial coverage in multiple, independent, reliably published sources) and so is not a suitable subject for inclusion here. There are, however, many aother websites which you might like to consider submitting to instead.  雲‍水 """,0

Dear anonymous editor: you are adding material to the Half Dome article that does not follow the guidelines for Wikipedia editing, hence is constantly being reverted. It doesn't matter that you believe going off the cables is safer. It does not matter that Will and I believe this to be false. The important thing about Wikipedia is that the articles are verifiable (that is, any fact can be traced to a reliable source, such as a book or newspaper), and written in a neutral point of view (i.e., does not favor a particular set of opinions).

If you wish to have your material stay in the Half Dome article, you have to come up with a reference that states that it is safer off the cables - you cannot rely on your own knowledge or intuition: you have to prove it to the rest of us. Further, if it is a controversial assertion (which this one is), then you need to phrase it as such. For example, if some association is favoring leaving the cables, then we could add:

Association X claims that leaving the cable is safer than waiting, while the National Park Service wants people to stay on the cable for safety.

Notice that this sort of phrasing does not talk about the absolute truth of whether it is safer or not: it reports who believes it to be safer and who does not. These should be official organizations or well-known experts - we can't cite random people in blogs, for example. Again, both of these assertions should be backed up with references. We can help you format the references, don't worry.

I would urge you to find a reputable source that recommends leaving the cables. Until you do so, I predict that the unsourced assertion is so controversial that it will probably just be reverted on sight.

 Naji al-Ali 

Hi Ian,

I noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to 1938. What is your source for that? I'm wondering because the Arabic wikipedia article, which this page started as a translation from, cites his year of birth as 1937, while a book I have about him - the one referenced in the article - cites it as 1936. What the book says in a footnote on the subject is """"Sulaiman al-Shaikh - """"The caricature artist Naji al-Ali"""" - in the Kuwaiti magazine al-`Arabi, no. 297, August 1983. Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection."""" While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son.

On the other hand, on this page Naji al`Ali himself is quoted as saying """"I was born where Christ was born: between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of al-Shahra in the northern Galilee, and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to `Ain al-Hilwe camp in Lebanon.""""

However, the same site also bases its short biography of Naji al-`Ali on the book I used, and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly.

Unless you have a solid source, I think we may have to leave it as unknown.

By the way, that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination, I wonder could we get permission to use it...

This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add  on the top of Mintsoftware librarian and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any citations from independent reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.",0

 MLK incident 

It's true that Greenberg said what he said. It's true that a Chicago Sun Times blog reported what he said. Those two facts, in and of themselves, do not make the MLK incident """"relevant"""" to his ESPN career. The fact that there was no meaningful followup coverage in reliable sources should establish that. Alleging that Greenberg's comment was a Freudian slip simply because he has mentioned making such slips requires a citation from a reputable source establishing that he said he makes Freudian slips.

You are welcome, of course, to contribute, but any change in the lead should probably be mentioned on the talk page.

 More on changes made to """"Early Soviet Rule and World War II section"""" 

I will not respond to the personal attack directed at """"the person who simply reverted this passage..."""". As for the substance of the issue:

1. Reasons of Capital move to Kharkov. ProhibitOnions introduced to the article an idea that one of the reasons of the capital move was the fact Kharkov's was more dominated by ethnic Russians than Kiev. This claim has some logic in the context of the events, but I have not seen this claim made in any serious source. If this is due to my ignorance, I suggest ProhibitOnions provides at least some references, or, if he can't find them off hand, at least gives some hints where he saw this info, so that it can be checked. His statement on the talk page that """"many historians concede"""" on this is too vague of a reference. If this is indeed his own speculation based on his interpretation of the logic of events, this qualifies as original research, whose place is current scholary or popular publications, personal web-sites, etc., but not an encyclopedia, which should reflect an established knowledge.

2. Possible role of famine in the capital return to Kiev.  PO agrees, that the discussion of the issue belongs to other articles but thinks, it is also relevant here. My point is that this info is factually accurate, but its relevance is too remote. Deliberate killing milions of people was a horrible crime, but Kiev itself, unlike the vast regions of Ukrainian countryside, was not ravaged by famine. Should the info on the deliberate famine caused by the actions of the Bolshevik government be introduced into every article related to any Ukrainian topic? If PO helps me understand why famine should be in Kiev article, I am open to ideas. 

3. Finally, PO removed from the article the statement that Kiev growth was mostly caused by migration from other parts of Ukraine which indeed re-established Ukrainian spirit in the city, which is confirmed, for example, by a relative rise of Ukrainian theater and literature in Kiev at the time. He substituted it by the statement about """"the migration from other parts of the Soviet Union."""" Where does he get this info?

The changes he introduced seem ideological rather that relevant and I reverted them once. Now, I laid out my reasons and will wait for some days for comments rather than reverting this changes right now. Please, no flames.  19:00, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)""",0

"The sentence that both of you want added is completely irrelevant to what anarchocapitalism is, and is dealt with in the body of the text. I'll give you an example via wikiprecedent: christianity. The lede does say that protestantism came from catholicism, just as the lede for anarchocapitalism says that it is an individualist anarchism form (parent). But the lede of christianity does not say (though it could with references) that the catholics did not consider protestants to be christian (and vice-versa). And given that historically western christianity was catholic only for a thousand years, we see the argument from antiquity attempt clearly fail.

As to what you misunderstand, Binksternet, it is due weight. I'll give another wikiprecedent: evolution. There is neither mention of creationism nor ID in the lede for evolution. At all. Period.

Ken Kesey learnt about LSD through his involvement in CIA MKULTRA experiments. He was a core figure in the burgeoning hippy movement. LSD did not leak into the 'youth culture' merely from medical sources, CIA had bought the majority of the world's supply of LSD, and this was a source and influence to the 'youth culture' movement just as important as Tim Leary.

I hope all goes well with you at Wikipedia, and you're as always, enjoying the world's greatest sport.  To answer your question, yes, I am the one who left a nasty message on a user's page whose name now escapes me.  Why did I do it?

Now I don't mean this as anything personal against you, as I've respected you and your work for years, and you've been nothing but nice to me.  But, what I don't get is this: I can't tell you how many times I've had to re-introduce legititmate images that have been taken down by people who upload stolen images, or images of lesser quality.  This detracts from the quality of articles, and frankly, I think people who detract from the quality of articles should'nt be allowed to edit.  What I don't get is that whenever I pop-off at someone for doing this, I get busted immediately, yet no one replaced the Abreu image, or scores of others that are taken down.  Furthermore, the guy who did this is just another red link - someone who doesn't even bother to fill out a user page.  It's all a matter of common sense and etiquette - it's not the best analogy, but you just don't go to MySpace or Facebook and start putting useless garbage on other people's pages.  
Same goes for Wikipedia - you just don't go around making articles worse, that legitmate volunteers have worked for years to constantly improve.

 Misinformation in the ride description for California Adventure? 

I believe (though I can't prove it) that there are several misstatements in the ride description for California Adventure. The article describes an exact series of drops and rises, but I believer the ride is actually different each time (as is the ride in Florida). I was on it yesterday, rode it twice in a row, and the two rides were very different. I have ridden it several dozen times since it opened, and it has always seemed to be a variable ride. Second, the article says that the elevator unloads in a different place from where it loads, but I wonder about that. On a previous trip I was accompanied by a person in a wheelchair. We left the wheelchair at the immediate entrance to the elevator, after passing through the """"doors"""", and it was waiting for us in the same position when we disembarked.

The problem is, while there are examples of androcentricity in language (although its effect on cognitive and social processes is debatable), the examples she cites are not, and she makes the rather fatal mistake of conflating grammatical gender with """"natural"""" gender and the diachronic with the synchronic analysis of language. She also seems to accept an extreme version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis completely uncritically, although the hypothesis is never even mentioned explicitly in the draft. It's pretty clear the author has not had any formal training in linguistics (or in the languages she has attempted to analyze), and appears not to have consulted the rather vast body of academic literature on androcentric language. Or perhaps she had, but decided ignore the inconvenient conclusions? In any case, it's fairly obvious why the original version of the book was not published by an academic press, and why the revised second version is self-published.

"...I don't believe this... I'm sorry, but the way you talk gives me the idea that you are of the opinion that Soeharto is no more than some kind of a dictator. Many thinks the same, I won't deny that. But you have failed to mention that he is who we call as 'Bapak Pembangunan' or 'the Father of Development'. During the reign of Soekarno, whose deed perhaps stopped at the proclamation on August 17th 1945 and the short time following when MPR and DPR are established, Indonesia are on the verge of being turned into a communist nation, and people are on the worst of poverty due to the minimum development and import-export. When Soeharto was the president, Indonesia was at its best of conditionschools are openened everywhere, the 9-year-education program are legitimated, etc. It would be too much to mention all of them. He ruled with military force, correct, but I personally think it was pretty much needed to keep things in order, and would be the right thing to do had not he overdid it.

And about Soekarno etc cooperating with Japan, it wasn't completely true. During their time in Indonesia, Japanese banned all national organization and established 'Putera' which aim was to have the educated people of Indonesia to work for Japan. Soekarno, Mohammad Hatta, and few others joined in 'Putera' just so they could gain information about Japanese and have supplies from them. This is also so the Japanese wouldn't keep their eyes on them while they secretly establish the national movement. There are also controverisal/underground organizations established by Indonesian icons that worked secretly amongst the villagers. I hope this would give you the rough sketch of the national movement during Japanese reign.",0

Another misconception is the origin of the Vic-20.  The real creator of the concept was Jim Kennedy who was the Commodore engineering manager after Chuck Peddle left in August, 1978 to work at Apple. Jack Tramiel asked him to visit MOS and he talked to Bob Yannes where he got the specs for the VIC chip.  He and I discussed a prototype VIC-20  but unfortunately Kennedy was canned in February 1980 when CHuck was re-hired by Commodore.

The Chameleon (Dmitri Smerdyakov) is a Marvel Comics supervillain, an enemy of Spider-Man. The Chameleon is a spy and master of disguise. Throughout his history, he has used a variety of traditional, high-tech and biologically enhanced ways to change his appearance, believably imitating almost anyone. He was also the ally, servant, and half-brother of fellow Spider-Man adversary Kraven the Hunter. His name is derived from the characters Dmitri and Smerdyakov from The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

Publication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he initially appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #1 (March 1963), and was the first member of Spider-Man's vast rogues' gallery, based on issue publication date, excluding the burglar who murdered Ben Parker. (Supercharger was the first Spider-Man supervillain chronologically.[1])

Novels The Chameleon had a vital role in the Sinister Six novel series by Adam-Troy Castro, in which the Gentleman, a long-lived supervillain and member of the Machiavelli Club (a gathering of some of the world's most sinister minds, including several non-Marvel characters) uses the new Sinister Six, of which the Chameleon is a member, as pawns in his schemes. Oddly enough, in this series he is referred to as Anatoly Smerdyakov. In the final novel in the series, Secret of the Sinister Six, the Gentleman betrays the villains and tries to escape; it is the Chameleon, to everybody's surprise, who kills the Gentleman, shooting the old man while disguised as a limousine driver and assuming his identity, only to be attacked by Dr. Octopus, thinking him to be the real Gentleman. Marvel has officially stated that the Sinister Six novels lay outside of normal continuity; however, these events have more recently been referenced in the Marvel handbooks. The Chameleon also plays the role of villain in the novel Goblin's Revenge. In this story, the Chameleon not only teams up with the murderous Carnage, but also attempts to drive Spider-Man insane by impersonating Norman Osborn (then thought to be dead and buried), and later trying to expose the web-slinger to a toxic chemical meant to destroy his mind.

Fictional character biography The Chameleon was born a Russian citizen named Dmitri Smerdyakov. In his youth, he was a servant and half-brother to Kraven the Hunter, Sergei Kravinoff, and eventually became a minor associate to one Gustav Fiers. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to him, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff from Smerdyakov. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the United States of America. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth, impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of the Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Kravinoff, now Kraven the Hunter, himself came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate's sights on Spider-Man.[2] Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues' gallery. The Chameleon inspired Kraven the Hunter to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero.[3] With Kraven, the Chameleon then battled Iron Man.[4] Chameleon then confronted the Hulk.[5] The Chameleon stole some paintings from an art exhibit, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.[6] The Chameleon disguised himself as Henry Pym, and robbed Pym's laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine. He delivered the documents and a shrunken Hulk to HYDRA, but was defeated by the real Pym as Ant-Man.[7] The Chameleon disguised himself as the Torpedo and battled Daredevil.[8] The Chameleon later first used his hologram belt to disguise himself to unsuccessfully take revenge on Spider-Man.[9] When Kraven the Hunter committed suicide,[10] the Chameleon became obsessed with making Spider-Man suffer for his failure to prevent Kraven from killing himself. He ingested a serum which made his face permanently featureless and malleable. He attempted to kidnap America's leading expert on supe",0

 Terminology 

They are substantives derived from the French verb """"tracer"""", which normally means """"trace"""",[9] or """"trail"""" (as in """"he escaped without a trace"""").[10]

The """"trail"""" bit, along with its explanation, doesn't seem to make much sense to me. The verb """"tracer"""" is commonly used in French slang to denote fast movement. In the lexicon used in footnote [9], the most accurate definition would be II A 3: """"Marcher vite"""", (""""walking fast"""")and """"filer"""" (""""to go fast""""). This is consistent with most of the synonyms of """"tracer"""" that denote movement, such as """"aller très vite""""  or """"courir""""  .

It ties in with the fact that parkour is described as """"moving around obstacles with speed and efficiency"""".

And finally, it also corresponds to the article about """"traceur"""" on the French site: """"tracer au sens familier de se déplacer à vive allure""""

Fastfission, I welcome your thoughts on the article and examples. In defense, here is some reply to the most telling point (and heart of the method) The """"predictions"""" section puts the horse before the cart: Watson had already seen the B-form photograph before they thought of proposing the double helix. In Watson's Double Helix memoir, he clearly states that he and Crick had already worked out the mathematics of the Fourier transform of a Helix as an X-shape. They had come upon it with the TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) and had already deduced TMV had a spiral shape. At the time of discovery (of structure of DNA) they did not know the orientation of the bases (inside or outside the helix) which Watson deduced by his concrete modelling of the nucleotide pairs. The discovery (of structure of DNA) came after, at least according to Watson's memoir. And Watson is still alive to clarify this for us. It is a golden opportunity for someone to ask and write down so that we can cite. But the article clearly states that scientific method is not linear, as you have well put. It is a horse-race between the steps, some of which can then be linearized after the moment of discovery, for publication.

The DC arc largely applicable to ferrous metals, benefits from using 2% thoriated tungsten (or 2% ceriated tungsten, an alternative to the radiological concerns of Thorium), while nonferrous metals such as aluminum and magnesium requiring AC current, are performed best with pure tungsten allowing the tip to melt into an enlarged balled surface at the end of the electrode.  A """"ball-point"""" subsequently flares the arc onto a much broader surface of the material, where greater expansion and distortion must then be accommodated, or anticipated as part of the welders job.

More Cleaning

There's cleaning or shaping of the electrode, and then there's cleaning or """"preparation"""" of the work-piece to be welded:  

As you say, dirt, oil and scale are simply removed from parts for a good weld.  Washing, degreasing, rinsing etc, but mechanical abrasion is fast, easy and most popular as shaping a weld chamfer can be done simultaneous to """"cleaning"""".   AlumaPrep (or some brand name like that), is simply an acid rinse to remove stubborn anodizing and any last marks of finger print oil from the 'touchy' AC needing metals.  But as Triddle pointed out in his explanation of +/- wave form capable machines, the plasma itself will often do a fine job of burning off simple surface impurities.  Deep inclusions (ubiquitous in sand casted work) are a frustration all unto themselves.  Welder (the person) tolerance, patience, and experience must often judge what level of weld quality exist after cooling.  High-tech work, demands that the work piece billet is good stuff to begin with, yet there is a variety of filler rod that can be used to accommodate persnickety base material.  Nickle, Bronze and """"Everdure"""" (brand name) are often blended into filler rods, and greatly assist the welder trying to fix cracked engine blocks or other sandy and oil impregnated work pieces.

Reactor vessels of all types, be they nuclear or cellular, are also a field unto themselves.  As the physical strength of a finished weld may really be the lesser of engineering concerns.  Chemistry plays a role in both questions of what will actually be held in the vessel, and how it may be cleaned between use.  Low carbon 316 SS (316L) commonly desired for biomedical applications where autoclaving and bleach will still kick the ass out of Stainless Steel.  Titanium and its many grades are like wise a subject for deep thought, but once the decision is made...  it works like soft butter, and few other welds can look so nice raw.

As to the safety stuff.

A hot horse shoe is hot, and most animals with any brain will let go of it before they get burned too bad.  Therefor, direct and immediate sensible surface heat, is far less of real danger than the intense UV of the plasma arch as Gaiusjuliuscesar talked about 'sun burn', often called """"flash burn"""".  Fully covering any skin, just as one might wish to reduce sun burn.  It's the same stuff.  Welders, responsible ones, will even clear a room of bystanders, even ones who """"know not to look into the light with out a hood"""".  Side vision (looking off to one side) doesn't work either, as the cornea and retina damage (not dependent on center of focused vision) is extremely painful when experienced, (ya, I know) and not felt for many hours after excessive exposure.

"Anarchism versus Religion 

Anarchism what does it mean for this anarchist hobbyist?

Anarchism started the First World War over the anarchist assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.  A anarchist decided to interrupt a world power practicing imperialism and assassinated the Archduke as he drove by the anarchist in the tiny nation of Serbia.  What the anarchist did not know is that there were a multitude of secret treaties among no less that fourteen nations including attitude from the Ottoman Empire and within weeks the world was at war as Serbia was invaded.

The result of the war that started in the tiny nation of Serbia is millions of deaths, chemical warfare, proof of machine gun and artillery fire, introduction of aviation into warfare, the Russian communist revolution, and a new world order that led to World War Two, since the Germans believed it was their leaders who failed them causing them to lose the war.

World War Two led to millions of deaths and a larger battlefield across the world including China and the Pacific Ocean (Japan was part of World War One, but the results were insignificant compared to the bloody battlefields of Europe).  The results of World War Two led to nuclear weapons, a space race, spy satellites, nuclear ships, nuclear bombers, nuclear missiles, communism across the world from communist Russia, United States being called imperialist due to being a world wide undefeated military power who is unafraid to invade anyone except the nations with the largest and best militaries (Iraq had a lager but sad capability military).  World War Two also led to the Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Desert Storm One that was the result of the former allies of World War Two dividing among themselves into two parties and fighting low intensity and hot wars across the world until the year 1991 including, for many families, three or more generations of military service from the United States.

Serbia as a result of the wars across the world of the 20th century has been subjected to the Muslims, Russians, United States, Germans, and civil war within itself and still has United States intervention this 21st century.  Under President Clinton Serbia was made smaller requiring a split of Kosovo and Serbia after a long bombing campaign that exhausted the stockpile of conventional United States missiles during the 1990s.

Serbia got its anarchy and is a backwards nation that has been under subjugation and gunfire since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Embrace anarchy and declare Heaven non-religion in a discussion section where Heaven is something of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith where the other faiths are atheistic in nature and worship man by a code of conduct, then you should embrace anarchy and go live off the lands in a mountain.  You have little knowledge of mythology and I bet you have no idea what you are doing concerning religion other than your personal attitude.",0

Different set of rules for different users

Hi, Romaioi. I have read your talkpage and I see that you have suffered a very sad experience, similar to the one that has banned me and others. I am user:Marygiove and I totally agree with you about what you write in your """"special archive"""". At least you can console yourself thinking that you now are not banned, while others like me have no such a """"luck"""". My only crime? To live in the metropolitan area of Miami (nearly 3 million people!) and so my IP is similar to the one of other italian users banned from wikipedia and who live here, like user:Brunodam and user:Cherso.  Anyway, as you wrote in your """"MFD Link"""", it is clear that Jimbo's rules are not followed and that there are """"different set of rules for different users"""", specially if there are nationalistic groups (like some  Croats who hate Italians) that pressure some admins to accept ONLY their POV on issues about the croatian Dalmatia.  I don't know if you are able to read italian, but may be you would be interested in accessing this website ( brunodam.blog.kataweb.it/2008/10/18/altri-commenti-sul-diniego-dellasilo-di-zara/), where some italians name you as an example of what is """"rotten"""" in the english wikipedia about impartiality of some admins dealing with italians and croats.

BTW, do you know that all the mess you have gone trough was started by one of the group of the nationalistic yugoslavians, named user:AlasdairGreen27?  He promoted the ban (with another of the group named Direktor) of an article about the """"Italian mare nostrum"""" written by Brunodam, and when you copied some sections of it in another article he believed you were Brunodam (or GiovanniGiove or Pio). In the section """"It is Bruno """" you can easily read that Noclador is convinced by this Alasdair that Brunodam is Romiaoi and/or  others (http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AlasdairGreen27&diff;=prev&oldid;=230773625#It.27s_Bruno_:-.29).  In other words, the astute Alasdair throwed the stone and then waited for Noclador to do all the fighting for him! This trick has been done by the croat group even other times with other persons: it is a trick used many times by the Tito propaganda agents and modelled from the Stalin KGB. And it seems to work well, seeing the fight that has happened between you and Noclador. Sincerely. Marygiove.""",0

 That was a real speedy deletion 

I am contesting this speedy deletion because of the following reasons:

This article is not a rip-off from 2002 Gujarat violence
The main article 2002 Gujarat violence did not have extensive details/coverage on what, when and how it happened. That was the main reason for this article to be started. This article will be linked under See more section or can be included as main article for subsection that describes how the riot took place.
Since this is considered a worst violence post-Indian Independence, a detailed timeline of the riots is essential for a better understanding for the reader.

-  

Please consider adding the """"extensive details"""" you planned to include in Timeline of the 2002 Gujarat riots to 2002 Gujarat riots instead. If the level of detail becomes excessive, then the need for a split might become apparent. See WP:Content forking, especially """"Point of view (POV) forks"""". —  Talk/Stalk 

 The problem with editing that article is, the editors there never allow our edits to stay. If it is against Muslims, even if it had been mentioned in books, then those edits are reverted. I would have to fight a never-ending battle there. Anyhow, I will start it. It would be good, if I can get the sentences that I had typed in Timeline of the 2002 Gujarat riots.

If you are satisfied that, in this case, there are such circumstances, then I won't question your judgement or ask for details. However, you might perhaps consider whether selective deletion/oversight of offending posts, or courtesy deletion might be better. Having said that, I leave it with you - I'll say no more and I'll not contest whatever you finally decide.

Diacritics: Moving forward

I too have no very clear idea about how to word an RfC, other than that it should be in relation to specific proposed changes to the MOS and not something vaguer. I also think it's very important to keep to the issue of diacritical marks in the original orthography of the language, and not stray into either additional letters (like eth or thorn) or the use of diacritical marks in transcription/transliteration (like retaining accents when going from πότε to póte or marking long vowels by macrons in transliterating a number of languages, including Greek and Japanese). These are separate issues.

The problems, for me, are primarily in the first paragraph of WP:DIACRITICS, which is evasive, muddled and inconsistent:
 – this is just evasion. Their use or non-use should be motivated, and hence should be encouraged or discouraged according to the strength of the motivation.
 – this encouragement to count """"hits"""" just results in muddled policy, apart from the problem of the weasel word """"general"""". However, this bit seems clear that the """"modifications"""" are to the same word, i.e. can be treated as stylistic modifications.
 This seems to me not to be consistent with the sentence before: is """"the common name"""" here supposed to be with or without the added diacritical marks? """"[V]ersions of  word"""" above should mean that """"the common """" is the same with or without the diacritical marks.
Is it possible to re-write this paragraph to achieve consensus? I don't know.   

 Agreed those are separate issuesAgreed the first quoted passage is evasive, but motivating use or avoidance of diacritics seems to be the sticking point.  Did you have some particular direction in mind?  My take has been that if reliable sources show that their use is normal for the names in question that they should be used here, except where particular subjects eschew them. E.g. for a baseball player named Eddie Sandoval we'd give him as Eddie Sándoval if some reliable sources did (it can't be based on a majority of English language sources, since majority of them ignore diacritics entirely, as a matter of editorial/publishing convenience). It's the same principle that we can cite a single source for Eddie's birth date and place even if most sources don't mention them.  A fact does not have to be provided by every single source to be considered reliable.  And it's not a matter of sources conflicting (analogous to giving two different birth dates); some giving only Sandoval without the diacritics is like some sources giving a birth year but not a full birth date; it is incomplete information, not conflicting information.  On the other hand, if Eddie himself is quoted saying he doesn't use the diacritic that should be a trumping factor (unless WP totally ditches subject preference in all areas, which seems unlikely given the number of discussions going on to make more allowances for subject preference all over the place).  This can apply to geography, too (Santa Fe, New Mexico is """"Santa Fe"""" not """"Santa Fé"""" despite the popularity of the diacritic in certain circles; the official name of both the city and the county are """"Santa Fe"""" with no accent. People frequently cite WP:OFFICIALNAME as if it were a policy, but it's actually just an essay, it may not accurately reflect the nuances in cases like this, and people often cite it without actually understanding what it says to begin with (it's frequently misinterpreted as being against use of official names, when it's really only against using them when they're directly unhelpful to readers, while otherwise we would almost certainly use the official name)I'm not sure """"general"""" in the second passage is actually a weasel word, rather than just lack of clarity.  It's not clear if it means the predominant use in reliable sources generally, the predominant use in general-audience sources, or both.  The inclusion of """"and reference works"""" strongly suggests the former.  Regardless, the """"hit-counting"""" aspect is a problem because of the aforementioned facts that a) English-language sources tend to ignore diacritics for their own conven",0

Whatever one calls it ...

ALL energy available to man other than nuclear (fission or fusion, fission includes geothermal) ultimately derives from the sun, currently or in the (distant) past.

I encourage ALL parties to go back and look at how this played out.  There was NO discussion other than threats & a dismissive suggestion to go play in your own sandbox.  Is this really how you want to run Wiki?  It is, after all, your playground, and you get to make the rules.  That's fine with me.  Maybe you really have dealt with too many vandals, and were quick to lump me in with whatever hooligans you may be used to dealing with.  If I really wanted to be a vandal, I could easily use an ip proxy to keep posting & causing trouble here.  There would be little that you could do about it, but that is not who I am.  I am an honest contributor who took exception to fiddles arrogant and insulting attitude.  We can disagree on that assessment, but don't expect me to get on my knees with some """"gee, I'm sorry"""" obsequiesness just so I can join the cool kids club.

My advice to you is maybe you, fiddle & hiber might reconsider your knee jerk reactions & at least assume positive intent (see """"community"""" heading above) & try a discussion that does not start with something along the lines of """"your work is rubbish.""""   16:42""",0

evidence of bad faith

...mimsy-whomever was clearly editing in bad faith in late Dec by deleting the link without discussion, as he was politely informed in early Nov that the link was not a copyvio, and that he should not even be attempting to delete it without discussion (see below). He is also an official member of the """"You Tube Deletion Committee"""" started by Dmcdeviti.e., has an admitted bias/ego investment in something other than editing this article.  From his current talkpage, you can easily observe that """"Nearly Headless Nick"""" is a close ally, and not constructively for the benefit of Wikipedia, from what I have seenNHN has recently made the bizarrely ludicrous accusation on mumsy's talkpageto Arygiouthat stating any alternate opinions about YT links is """"disruptive."""" He clearly has ZERO idea what """"disruptive"""" means, as on-topic good faith editorial opinions on talkpages are never disruptiveor perhaps he does know and is trying to bully??? NHN, on the other hand, is in fact participating in a project which is disrupting Wikipedia to make a point; has certainly had a decidedly and idiotically disruptive effect on this article, in my experienced judgement.  My feeling is that they can get lost and stay lost, or we can take it to a higher level.  They are not editors of this article, they have categorically refused to engage in discussion on the talkpage of this article while making edits they know are disputed, and they do NOT have consensus on policy pagesconsensus is against them. What they lack in consensus they have tried to compensate for with bullying (which disgusts me).

"""personal view of """"fire in the lake"""" is that it is a dated political tract written at a time (1972?) before many sources were available to write any kind of history. Especially any history about events in North Vietnam during the 1950s. The author of the book further makes all kinds of statements about Vietnamese that with distance sound condiscending or even worse. When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so. By contrast, Stanley Karnow writing in 1983, was writing in a less hysterical political climate and had access to more material than was available in 1972.

FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION
Dr Philip Opas (defence lawyer for Ryan, recently deceased) made it public knowledge that he did not, and would never endorse Richards book The Hanged Man, because the facts surrounding Ryan life and case had been manipulated. The book was published 35 years after Ryan's hanging - only after almost every person directly involved in the Ryan case had died, making allegations by Richards impossible to retort or confirm as fact. Richards tried but failed  to bluff Opas to support the book by signing it inside the front cover, """"To Philip and Stella from Mike Richards"""". But it's no surprise that the highly intelligence and most experienced Opas was not easily fooled by anyone. The book became a toilet item.
It's ironic that User:Purrum promotes and contributes to the Ryan article from two books, which not only contradict each other, but have also been exposed to contain lies. For unknown reasons User:Purrum deliberately ignores the mega referenced articles published over four decades that acknowledge the facts.

My Reverting of The Edit In The History Section
I didn't revert the edit because the material you removed isn't redundant in some ways, which is fairly obvious if you read the  section as a whole. The entire history section of this article is still in very bad shape in my opinion, I'd suggest that its got non NPOV issues in several spots, the tone it's written in and choice of words seem somewhat """"chatty"""" and unencyclopedic to me and worst of all it continues to contain, what I'd argue, are historical inaccuracies in some places. Instead of editing out the paragraph that was removed today, which contained a link to a map, as well as an internal link to the ongoing Caledonia land dispute, a subject quite relevant in the Grand Valley these days, I'd like to see the entire history section itself brought up to a higher standard. In my opinion, from a historical perspective, the article itself would benefit more if some of the earlier comments in it regarding the acquisition of the land by the Six Nations were edited out and replaced by the material that was removed today. As I said back in August, I'm willing to work on this article myself as time allows, but in my opinion it doesn't make sense removing content that's not only relevant and contains references, it's actually of a higher quality than what remains.

 Locations 
Thailand.
While Phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in Thailand that includes sex tourism.  Pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism.  I dont know Phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more non-sex tourists so if I were going to identify a place in Thailand if not the world I would mention Pattaya instead and I am tempted to edit.  I hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more """"sex for money"""" going on in Pattaya than Phuket. But for someone considering the phrase """"sex tourism"""" as not necessarily pejorative I have to qualify this conclusion.  
Note that """"bar girls"""" in Thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general Thai population also.  Although I beleive that there are words in Thai for prostitute they mostly (at least the girls) prefer to call themselves """"rented wifes"""" albeit for """"short time"""" rather then """"long time"""".  I therefore need to be qualify my Pattaya versus Phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and  rented wifes particularly of the """"long-term"""" married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the """"wifes"""" direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both.  There is no such thing as a free lunch and """"everybody pays for it"""". 
[Note that I neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist (note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing) and moreover consider them culturally aware (particurlay Thailand wise).  The fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones! One must be aware that labels, concepts, ideas such as """"sex tourism"""" carry suggestions associated with Religion particularly Judeo-Christiam-Islamic (JDI) pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the (Religious) worlds worldviews outside of some tribal, village, usually Buddhist and what I like to call """"Giesha cultures"""": e.g. Japan, Thailand etc, versus """"Virgin cultures"""" typically (JDI) that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. (Note that Thai Society is strangely contradictory in this regard  aren't we all!  but then Thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west.)  Perhaps some historio-religious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also.  I hate value laden western (and Religious) labels that dress themselves up psuedo-scientificly as culturally universal. Exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more """"exploitation"""" going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like Chinese factories where labourers - girls included - work excruciating long hours for a few Yuan or RMB.]

Kanzi started vocalizing the word """"yogurt"""" in an unknown """"language""""; his sister, who could not see the yogurt, then pointed to the lexigram for yogurt.[5] """".

Now in this case, TG, there is a clear misrepresentation of the source, which reads 

""""In one experiment she described to me, she placed Kanzi and Panbanisha, his sister, in separate rooms where they could hear but not see each other.

He was then asked to communicate this information to Panbanisha.""""Kanzi vocalized, then Panbanisha vocalized in return and selected ‘yogurt’ on the keyboard in front of her,""""Savage-Rumbaugh tells me.""""

These accounts are substantially different, as you can see. 

In the source, S-R explains to Kanzi. through lexigrams, that he 'would be given' yogurt - in the article, he is 'shown' the yogurt.

In the source, Kanzi is asked to tell Panbanisha that he would be given yogurt, in the article he isn't.

In the source, Kanzi simply vocalizes; in the article, he vocalizes in an """"unknown 'language'"""".

Why is the wiki article simplified in this way ? Because the claims in the source are incredible. As far as I know, lexigrams do not include words such as 'would', so S-R can't tell Kanzi that he 'would' be given yogurt. Secondly, Kanzi is supposed to understand 3000 spoken English words (that's according to the wiki bonobo article, which references (guess what) the same Raffaele article we're talking about), so why does S-R need to use the lexigram at all ?

More importantly, both the article and the source refer to this 'experiment'. It would be nice to know the details of this experiment, which might describe how many objects Kanzi was shown, how often he vocalized, and how many times Panbanisha responded with accuracy, and so on.

I can't find this experiment. Tonight I contacted the Great Ape Trust, where S-R works with Kanzi, and asked for the reference. I'll let you know what they say. I'll leave off amending the article in the meantime.   """,0

This is the text i struggle to post in G.91 page. Just to realize how i want to contribute to wiki, and how someone don't want i do it:

The Aeritalia G.91, also known as the Fiat G.91 and nicknamed Gina, was an light Italian fighter aircraft that was intended to serve as standard equipment for NATO air forces in the 1960s. It was eventually only adopted by three - the Italian Air Force, West Germany's Luftwaffe, and the Portuguese Air Force, but enjoyed a long service life that extended over 35 years.

Development
In 1953, European aircraft manufacturers were invited by NATO to submit aircraft for evaluation for the Light Weight Strike Fighter (LWSF) role. The G.91 was designed to the specification by the famous Italian engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli, hence the """"G"""" designation. The competition was intended to produce an aircraft that was light, small, expendable, equipped with basic weapons and avionics and capable of operating with minimal ground support. These specifications were developed for two reasons: the first was the nuclear threat and the other was to counter the trend towards larger and more expensive aircraft.

The technical requirements were: 
 1,100 m take-off distance over a 15 m obstacle
 Capability to operate from grass strips and streets
 Max speed of 0.95 Mach
 Range of 280 km with 10 min over the target
 Armoured protection for the pilot and the fuel tanks
 4x12.7 mm or 2x20 mm or 30 mm guns
 A maximum of 2,200 kg empty weight and 4,700 kg max weightFerrari 1992, p. 83.

The challengher proposals must had been presented within two months after the request.
The projecting work was only apparently an easy task, because making a very small aircraft yet capable to cover these NATO specifications was difficult. 

Fiat Aviazione presented G.91 and so did other competitors with a total of 10 projects, analysed since 18 March by AGARD (Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development), led by Theodore Von Karman. The finalists were declared Breguet Taon, Dassault Etendard, Fiat G.91 and Folland Gnat. Another interesting project was Sud Aviation Badoleur, that solved drastically the problem of a proper landing undercarriage, simply omitted and sobstitued with a landing and take off skid (aircraft was moved in ground operations with a special trailer). This, however, was not ufficially presented to AGARD, that choose, on paper, the Taon as winner.

In the meanwhile, there was the problem of the engine, that must been light yet enough powerful and reliable, with easy and cheap maintenance, like the whole aircraft. The solution was realized by Bristol with the Bristol Orpheus, a simple and effective turbojet. It was adopted to all the finalists, so Bristol will won the contest in every case. G.91R, presented by Fiat, was also called 'little Sabre'. It was due by the knowledge gained with license-production of a modern aircraft, the F-86K, that helped to make much experience with advanced jet aircrafts, . It was similar to F-86 as overall design, but smaller and capable to operate from semi-prepared airstrips.

G.91R was 20% heavier than the estimates and this was due partly to testing hardware, but it was powered by a Bristol Orpheus B.Or 801, 1,800 kg/t. 
It was yet capable to supersonic speed in dives, as shown by the flight made in 20 February 1957 when it was able to break the sound barrier four times with 9,000 m dives. His test pilot Riccardo Bignamini, a famous one of that times (he won McKenna Trophy at Empire Test School) was a key element to solve the G.91 shortcomings and the first flight was made in 9 August 1956 at Torino-Caselle airfield. 

Few days after it was tested at high speed and at 1,300 m ceiling, but lost control and Bignamini w",0

"/f/ in Georgian? 

Hi.  Do you have a source for your addition to the Georgian language page where you said that ფ is pronounced as /f/ when it corresponds to an /f/ sound in loan words from Greek and other languages?  It was (and is) my understanding that when foreign words containing /f/ are incorporated into Georgian, the sound is spelled as ფ, and the ფ is pronounced normally (as /pʰ/).  For example, პროფესია (profession, occupation) is pronounced /p'rɔpʰɛsia/ (not /p'rɔfɛsia/).  As far as I am aware, /f/ is not a separate phoneme in Georgian; rather, it occurs only as an alternative pronunciation of ვ before unvoiced consonants.  Admittedly, I only know a very small amount of Georgian, so I am not in a position to put myself forth as any sort of authority on this.   (talk · contribs)",0

Oxonian2006, my tone may sound a bit out of control but I'm not. Issues like this one are very important to me due to my own family history. Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many """"the Nazis"""" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the """"Nazis"""" who came from """"Greenland or Mars"""" or """"Nazi allies"""". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. """"The German-led Nazi occupation"""" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the """"General Government"""" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. 
Therefore he """"Nazi"""" is NOT a perfectly good word to use in this case and never will be.
Now, about the Polanski who in your opinion is not a Holocaust survivor. Well...he escaped the Cracow Ghetto on the way to the extermination camp. He would be dead otherwise. Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest.

 ==The SPÖ in Mein Kampf 

At one moment Hitler lauded the Social Democratic Party in his mind (Friedrich Austerlitz, Anton David, Viktor Adler and Wilhelm Ellenbogen are mentioned by their last names on p. 66 of Mein Kampf) for championing """"das allgemeine und geheime Wahlrecht"""" (Mein Kampf, p. 39) or universal suffrage, saying to himself that this must lead to a weakening of the so-hated-by-him Habsburg monarchic rule. When he later saw more of what the party was about however, he suggested its members were being servile to the Slavs to the point of debasing themselves, as one who is utterly mendicant, whilst disfavoring the Germans in an attempt to save the multiethnic melting pot of Austria-Hungary.

At some point this began to happen.  It is incredibly offensive.  In fact, to me, it is much more offensive than if someone called me a cunt.

At least 10 times, and perhaps 20 times or more, my edits have been reverted, often with no explanation, and sometimes with accusations of vandalism.  It's been many months since the first time.  And whether you take a polite tone, or you just mouth off at everyone, the end result is exactly the same.

 External links on ballet 

Hello! External links are often taken as a """"For further reading"""" section, and as such, should complement the article, adding information we could not. As for ballet terminology, Wikipedia has a Glossary of ballet, and as we are working to create free content, it is more beneficial for us to create a better repository of terms and their meanings than to link to a copyrighted collection. Similarly, we shouldn't be linking to content which we should have, or which is only marginally related (physics of all dance is only marginally related to ballet). However, if you meant to reference a section, there's a different method of going about this documented at Wikipedia:Citing sources. The links used would be contained in a ==References== section, and it'd especially help if you could indicate which facts were verified and which weren't.

 pile of cn tags on the article. 

An editor added a pile of cn tags to the article. As far as I've noticed, the facts tagged are well-known and can be supported by references in time. Some of the facts should indeed have attribution, such as """"According to Khalifa,"""" and I have the books buried somewhere in this apartment. Let's look at the current tagged text, I'll start a subsection for each.   
using computers in 1968
Starting in 1968, Khalifa used computers to analyze the frequency of letters and words in the Qur'an.
1974 claim of numerical pattern
In 1974 he claimed that he discovered an intricate numerical pattern in the text of the Qur'an involving the number 19 mentioned in verse 30 of chapter 74 of the Qur'an.
This may be inaccurate, his original work on numeric pattern did not connect pattern to 30:74, but I'll check. What we may be seeing here is later synthesis.   
Details of claim
The details of this analysis including tables are available in the back of his book, Quran, the Final Testament.[2]
This was not tagged, but needs attention anyway
The details shifted over the years, and what was published in the Final Testament is quite different from the earlier publications. So it is not """"this analysis,"""" i.e., the 1974 analysis.   
Many popular magazines and newspapers
Many popular magazines and newspapers[which?] in the Muslim world reported his discoveries.
This doesn't need two tags. I'll pull the first.  
Other magazine and newspaper articles
Many other magazines and newspaper articles by and about Khalifa appeared throughout the world in many languages.
This is redundant, I'll yank it.   
Many Muslim organizations
Various Muslim organisations however have criticised Dr. Rashad's studies,[citation needed] accusing him of spreading heresy and ignorance through his proclamation of himself as a prophet
Doesn't need two tags, and it's WP:WEASEL. Definitely, we need specifics. I'll yank one tag.   """,0

"""It appears that the coin might replace the $1 bill almost completely that soon the $1 bill might get out of circulation. As a result of this combined with the fact that Alexander Hamilton is no longer as well-remembered as he was back in 1928, the year that follows whatever year this happens (I believe it might be sometime around 2020) might be a time to change the portraits on the bills as follows:

The $2 bill changes from Thomas Jefferson to George Washington

The $5 bill changes from Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Jefferson

The $10 bill changes from Alexander Hamilton to Abraham Lincoln

The $20, $50, and $100 bills, however, will not change portraits.

What are your votes??

Washington on the dollar coin and the $5 bill (thus, keeping the pattern of Washington on the highest generally circulating coin and the smallest generally circulating bill).  Lincoln bumped up to the $10 and the quarter (dropping the penny), Hamilton bumped up to the $20 (or Lincoln bumped up to the $20, Hamilton staying on the $10).  The $50 and $100 stay the same.  Another idea - Washington on the $20 bill, Lincoln on the $1 coin, again, killing the penny  06:27, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Oh, and while we're at it, let's add a $500 bill.  And make our bills prettier  06:29, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I think it's quite a demotion for Washington to go from the one-dollar bill to the two-dollar bill.  18:31, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Surely being on a higher denomination (curculating) bill is more desirable? otherwise why not put old George on the cent coin  23:16, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)

 Bridge to Teribithia 

Now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text, I've checked, and he or she is right; there is no mention of Young at IMDb, the film's page, or her own homepage. That User:Shelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that she's not Shelby Young; moreover, if she were, she shouldn't be editing the article on herself. Mel Etitis (Talk)  
I haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  
IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an """"alternate ending""""). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  
1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in """"Night at the Museum"""". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. 
2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.

3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.

4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a """"popular"""" one that has been photoshopped. If so, where is it? I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. Ispy1981

Without a metatheory, one does not have a truth predicate, which complicates things for realism, because the whole point of that philosophy is that sets really do exist and actually do have the properties ascribed to them. One could argue in favor of a disquotational definition of truth, but that merely pushes the problem around, leading to the same problems as full second-order semantics for arithmetic.   Also, not having a metatheory means that one must treat set theory differently than other branches of mathematics, such as group theory or linear ordering theory. This seems like a difficult distinction to justify. 

I do think that the """"no metatheory"""" interpretation of ZFC (or Zermelian set theory, if you prefer that) is somewhat common, because it is one way of avoiding the issue that what is called V in the object theory cannot be distinguished from a set in the metatheory. One consequence of my original point is that it would also be coherent to interpret this no-metatheory language merely as a way of making statements from the viewpoint of a person inside a particular model of set theory. Moreover, this interpretation is entirely compatible with the viewpoint that there is an objectively-defined collection consisting of all sets, if no additional meta-level principles such as the ability to force over V are added. However, if one already viewed """"all sets"""" as merely a façon de parler with no objective referent, as I think you are proposing, then it's not clear why one sort of disquotation (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets"""") is better than another (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets in the model at hand""""). — Carl ( · talk) """,0

I work with enterobacteria every day and phage therapy was discussed on an expert meeting I went to. Phage therapy was exhumed recently but most of us see the therapeutic potential overrated particular by the mass media. That is not to say that there is no potential but there is too much evidence against a widespread use. I think we all would like to have good handle in the light of multiresistant strains.

There is no real track record of tests that were carried out in the west but as far as we know some attempts were made in early years (failures are rarely published). There are newer test in the literature carried out in the food industry and in mice.
The idea that things were """"forgotten in the West"""" is often used to give weight to arguments but in modern research there is hardly anything left that is not written in English. There is a lot of information on the web that we should take into account, including positive arguments for phage therapy, for instance this review.

However, even in the postive light that the review draws, one should not forget about the severe problems that need to be tackled.

There, that's what I am trying to say.
Hindu nationalism has an already an article. I don't see the point of reiterating it here again.
The article was NOT created as an extension of Hindi-Muslim conflict. That part is already mentioned here: Islam_in_India#Hindu-Muslim_conflict. If you think that is what needs to be done, please move it to Hindu-Muslim_conflict.
Anti-Buddhist can be removed, specially since his son himself corrected the mistakes. But on the otherhand, anti-christian, muslim, sikhism, hindu - they are fought over petty local policies and given the color of religion by recalling ancient atrocities. It would be akin to Spanish acquisition causing anti-Spanish violence now.

The article was created to quench the India-bashing thirst. At least I fail to see any other reason for its existence, because otherwise we wouldn't be discussing what the article really refers to etc.
Also, don't forget then the anti-Hindu violence, specially in southern India and eastern India - places where Hindus are in minority. And don't forget that the riots are never one sided. Right now the article looks like a list of religious atrocities committed in India, which is a ridiculous topic, but I believe it can be turned into a comprehensible and well cited article.

 List of mycologists 
Thanks for creating the list of mycologists.  The only thing that might be missing is the author abbreviation.  I have been linking a lot of those lately in the mushroom articles.  

I noticed that the botanists have everything set up pretty well - They have a list of botanists with abbreviations and also a template to make it easy to put a box in an article that gives the abbreviation info.

I copied it and changed a couple words - Now we have:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Mycologist

I tried it out on Gaston Guzman.  

There are still some red links, I haven't decided if I should reword the template or add the articles that are in red.

What do you think?

 

I can see the advantage of having author abbreviations included on the list of mycologists, and I can't see the harm of a separate  to parallel , although since mycology falls under the ICBN, all mycologists are, in some sense, botanists (and many were both, particularly in the early days), so the links in the template should lead to author citation (botany) and botanical name. We should not expect a separate article on """"author citation (mycology)"""" to be created, since mycological naming is botanical naming, even if the organisms aren't plants.  

 Melolonthinae 

Thanks for fixing the errors I made in creating Melolonthinae. I took a leap creating it since I have zero practical knowledge of the subject. Hey this is totally random, but I figure you might know a thing or two about biology as a whole. Why does Canis lupus familiaris cover everything from a chihuahua to a great dane yet other animals with very minor variations (ex. Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdnerii, Oncorhynchus mykiss newberrii) are distinct subspecies?   C T 

The species is normally defined as a group of """"actually or potentially interbreeding populations"""" (the biological species concept), which means that if two animals can interbreed to produce fertile offspring, they are considered conspecific. Subspecies are defined more vaguely, as divisions of a species which are not different enough to prevent interbreeding, but which have fairly constant differences. I don't know what the morphological difference between O. m. newberrii and O. m. gairdnerii is, but I am sure there is one. The unusual situation is Canis lupus familiaris, which has been subject to artificial selection, and so exhibits much more physical variation than is normal for taxa of such limited genetic isolation. I am not sure whether it is really valid to apply scientific names to domestic dogs and the like in the first place, although it is widely done; perhaps it represents the scientific name of the wild taxon from which the domesticated breeds are derived. By contrast, cultivated plants have their own system of nomenclature, separate from the ICBN.

i would suggest to remove the passage about the mode of action of deet.this is speculaton and not proven. based on the NOR guidelines i cant say its wrong, but my data suggest that it might be not correct (blood substitute with ATP as sole attractant is also 'protected' by DEET (while there is no lactic acid...).   

Removed the """"natural alternatives"""" or actually added a question mark. Added refs to show that these """"alternatives"""" do not work. Also removed various distinctions between """"natural"""" and """"synthetic"""". There is no difference between a molecule synthesised chemically and naturally. Last: DEET is a repellant, NOT an insecticide.  

Made new page on DEET, using material gleaned largely from the CDC and EPA pages, and a couple of studies on health effects and insect-repellant effectiveness (from Google).  Although a bunch of the pages say one should be careful only to wear DEET when necessary, not under clothing, etc., they don't spell out why they're concerned.  I'm guessing DEET is chemically nasty (is it an organo-phosphate?), and so may have carcinogenic or other unfortunate properties.  If someone knows (and ideally can show) what these suspected effects might be, I think a short (hopefully rational) addition to the DEET page is called for.   15:03, 20 Oct 2003 (UTC)

What was Charlie Coll's contribution? Some Canadians think he invented the stuff.  22:13, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Is it a poison? If so, what is the LD_50? Is it liquid or a gas or solid (at room temp and standard conditions)? Thanks.  

As mentioned in the article, its effect on the human body is not yet fully understood; it's ?gay? (eh? - Ed) and not an organophosphate (as seen from the chemical formula image) but the effect seen with leeches provides a clue as to what might happen if enough of it entered the body. The effect on leeches is added from my own experience, using a concentrated DEET stick (like a deodorant applicator) and only needing to touch the leech for it to convulse off. It's a liquid at rtp, as far as I can tell.  10:10, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
Be careful adding from your own experience. That basically violates the Wikipedia:No original research policy. But that's simple to avoid, since if you've seen the effect, most likely someone else has. Wikipedia needs to be a secondary source, citing other published sources. So find a published source that finds the same thing, and the addition would be much better. Also it is liquid, as long as the repellant product bottles that say they are 100% deet really are. Also, just eyeballing from it's structure, liquid looks about right. I read a bunch of studies on DEET, and they all basically say it is safe as far as they can tell, but avoid overexposure as much as possible. A very small percentage of the time, some people (12 if I recall the study correctly, out of a large population) have a reaction to DEET. Basically the 60 years it has been used and the large amount of usage is strong evidence that at least the stuff is not really really nasty. So the article looks pretty accurate in that respect. -  Talk 12:00, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)
Whoops, didn't know about that. Thanks. I'll leave it in for the moment and will try to remember to do backup research when I get home; if anyone believes that the information is unreliable enough please feel free to mark it out, and I'll just have to find a better source than word of mouth from my parents at the time ;)
Later: Researched. Found a fair bit of anecdotal evidence but not enough hard evidence to keep my previous addition in.

OK, here goes at another attempted explanation.  Ignore the IP currently using 221/6. His intentions appear to be good, but I don't think he is helping.
 Stop taking this personally. No-one actually knows you, all we have to go on are a set of edits. We are largely strangers to each other - strong statements like """"betrayal"""" and """"slander"""" suggest motives that imply the other editor has taken against you personally.
 You are treating people's comments in a strangely literal way. If you don't understand what someone says - just ask them to explain a different way. Do not assume that everything is an attack.
 Copyright - yes you may absolutely tag and report something that appears to have been copied and pasted from another source.  What you need to watch for is that the other site didn't get its material from Wikipedia to start with.  They don't always credit Wikipedia as the source. However, it is better to tag it than not - the project cannot afford the risk.
 Notability - rather than tag an article for deletion, start a discussion. With the soap opera characters, starting a general discussion about notability at the WikiProject is a good idea.  If the talkpage is active, start a discussion there. Always try to notify the article creator.
 Read WP:BEFORE.  Non-notable articles rarely damage the project unless they are also inaccurate or completely foolish (an article about my cat for example would be completely foolish, as the cat is known to no-one outside my family and our neighbours, and is just an ordinary cat), so there's often no urgent rush to delete things that are non-notable.  Someone spent time and effort working on it.  What other steps might be taken - can the information be merged into another article and a WP:REDIRECT used, for example.
 If you eventually decide that nominating for a deletion discussion is the only option, use a neutral rationale. Do not attack the article creator because they have disagreed with you. Remember it is a discussion. Do not attribute any motive to those who disagree other than the differing viewpoint of a stranger.
 Images - if you find someone has pirated an image from a newspaper website, and uploaded it as their own work, yes you absolutely must tag it as a copyvio for speedy deletion.  In other instances, it is better to identify the least drastic option to deal with the damage.  Can I fix it myself? Can I alert the uploader - maybe they just made a mistake? If in doubt, always tag for WP:PUF which results in a discussion, not for deletion.
 Talk - explain why you thought what you did. Don't post reams of justifications and question the motives of others. You may be right, but you'll lose if you can't discuss things with people.
 Read the guidelines and policies and understand what the project is about.  You haven't got it yet.   """,0

"""::(1) The french engines (40 HP) were superior, to those the Wright brothers claimed they built (less than 20 HP), being more powerful. (2) The brothers used the same catapult, the same extra boost, as in 1905 in all their witnessed flights performed in 1908. In conclusion more powerful engines were logically not needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Correct, they didn't """"need"""" more powerful engines in 1908, but were probably glad to have them. However, your conclusion that therefore their statements about their previous flights are """"their own fiction"""" is merely your own fanciful opinion, to which you're entitled, but which flies in the face of more than 100 years of published information and, yes, the WB own documentary proof, undisputed by all reputable historians. The 1-minute 45-second flight you mentioned was Wilbur's very first in France; about a month later he flew 90 minutes (after Orville had made hour-long flights in the U.S.).   
 I base all my affirmations on primary sources and not latter judgements. The so called reputed historians are just pro Wright Brothers propagandists who simply selected what they liked from primary sources and made up a nice story for the public, disregarding all evidence that throws serious doubts regarding the claimed 1903-1905 flights.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Interestingly, the primary sources of which you're fond include voluminous amounts of documentation by the WB themselves of their work and their success. Try some affirmation based on that. You're right, though: propaganda does existnot in the writings of respected historians, but in misguided scribblings that sometimes show up on these pages.   

There is mention of the seven """"French"""" engines of 1908 here:  http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6550620m/f260.image.r=wright.langEN. They are intended to be delivered as  """"seven perfect copies"""" of the model brought by the american aviator.   

 Strange picture - On Dec. 14, 1903, W. Wright flew with the two propellers on the left side of the plane, one of them not connected to the engine! 

The picture labeled LC-W86- 20, (see http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wri/item/2001696254/ ) from the Library of Congress, shows W. Wright just after he landed the plane on Dec. 14, 1903, damaging the front-rudder (the canard double wing). The flight was powered but the airplane landed below the altitude where it had taken off. The strange thing about this picture is that the plane (see one of the large size versions of the image) has both propellers on its left side, the leftmost propeller being not connected to the engine. There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity. 

""""There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity."""" Indeed, a perfect description of the posts above and below. I recommend an optometrist.   
Ok. It was my mistake. I was mislead by the optical illusion the image contains. I should have studied the photography more carefully.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138

""":::::: Dear Chris, It took me a while to uderstand what happened. Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your """"seen in the above insulting comments"""" which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say """"where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". Why do you think that """"Einstein, Landau and Feynman"""" are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned """"world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture.

 If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier. 

 If I'm wrong (you don't believe that there is a God) then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis (actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we can't discuss it anymore). So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one. Advice to BB folks: state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you won't need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you. Otherwise you'll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein, Landau and Feynman since they don't understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have.

Since the Safety Car came on before the frontrunners had made their pitstops (not to forget Montoya retiring due to the drain cover incident), there is no way of verifying such a claim, other than believing press releases by the teams concerned, which are not exactly models of unbiased reporting - especially given that throughout most of the season, McLaren were shown to be qualifying with much more fuel on board than Renault.

Receiving money from KGB (edit request)
Rajiv Gandhi and his family including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi received money from KGB. The payments were authorised by a resolution and endorsed by the USSR Council of Ministers, and had been coming since 1971. In December 2001, Subramanian Swamy filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court, acting on which the court ordered CBI to ascertain the truth of the allegations in May 2002. After two years, the CBI told the Court that Russia would not entertain such queries without a registered FIR.

Since the Rajiv Gandhi (former PM of India) page mentions the above, this should be mentioned on Rahul's page too. This guy is being projected as the next Prime Minister of India. A fact like this cannot be suppressed, considering that the Russians confirm that KGB paid Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. 70.76.85.36  """,0

Kent wrongly describes the Sathya Sai Baba movement in Malaysia as a """"Hindu Revitalization movement."""" Whilst local Hindu practices have indeed been encouraged, it would be wrong to use this term because Sai Baba has encouraged people of all religions to adhere to their own religions and has often quoted from the Bible and the Koran in his discourses.

And I had hoped that, because measurement is done both with clocks we build (to measure time in material reality) and with our conscious experience (which is debated among philosophers and lay people as to whether or not that is contained in material reality or is somehow different) that you guys (with the exceptions of SQ and JW) would see the wisdom of not jamming them together in a run-on sentence and see the wisdom of setting up the topic in all three major POVs: Time as phenomenon, Time as physical measurement, Time as experience right away in two lede sentences.  Everything else in the article will fall under one of those three; """"religion, philosophy, and science... business, industry, sports, the sciences, music, dance, and the live theater"""".  I am convinced that the professor would grade my lede definition higher than what is there now, and far better than what was there before.  Too bad.

I followed this drama for a day. I was one of several people who warned the user that a block was likely forthcoming, which happened. The block was appealed several times until an admin unblocked (too soon, in my view but again, I'm not an admin). So shortly after the unblock, you identified the user as a sockpuppet. (Well, probably you blocked because of it.) So my question is this, as a relative newcomer - some time and effort could have been saved here - and maybe it was but I just don't know it. Can you shed a little light on the sequence of events after the unblock, or that were occurring elsewhere while the block/unblock was going on? (I'll watch your page or you can email me from mine.)

 Factual error and substitution of opinion for fact concerning reconstruction of infratructure

The introduction to the article makes the following claim:

The invasion has led to increased civil violence, political breakdown, the removal and execution of former president Saddam Hussein, and national problems in the development of political balance, economy, infrastructure, and use of the country's massive reserves of oil.""""

The inference about problems in infrastructure is factually inaccurate. There is ample documentation available online, at sites such as www.enr.com (site of Engineering News-Record, the world's leading construction and engineering professional journal) and the U. S. Department of Defense news site at http://www.defendamerica.mil/, of the extent of reconstruction and new construction in Iraq, especially in remedying deterioration and neglect dating to the Saddam regime.

 There were three trials over many months. Clarity needed. 
 The trails were covered by reporting restrictions - that affects what is reported here.
 Full details of the trials are not public domain due to the need to protect victims - UK Law Applies. 

Big Questions - 
 Does the table give undue prominence? 
 Who should be included - all accused - only the guilty - only those assessed as guilty of sexual offences - what are the criteria to be used?
 Should it list only charges found Guilty or should all charges including not guilty and dismissed be listed? 
 The Jury were unable to reach verdicts in all charges and the judge ordered they were to be left lie on file for future retrial should new evidence arise  - this needs to be addressed as it is a legal reality and on record.

Should the table address sentencing rather than charges? This may seem a cop out, but I have to point to the rights of Victims to use Wiki and not be abused by overly detailed content which does not add to overall reality. Footnotes can direct those who need full details to external sources.

 Choosing an easement curve 

I'd like to be clear about:
(a) which curves are actually used in practice ...
(b) in the various railways administrations; not just North American but also others, e.g. Australian, European, Indian etc.  (This would help with NPOV.)

My main concern is with (a).  Although the article mostly discusses Euler spirals, it seems to give the impression that's the only curve used, under varying names.  However, consider this quotation (from the AREMA reference in the article):
There are several different types of mathematical spirals available for use, including the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate.  Of more common use on railways are the Searles, the Talbot and the AREMA 10-Chord spirals, which are empirical approximations of true spirals.
This reference is, of course, discussing common use on American railways; but even in this limited context, it appears there are at least three ideal mathematical spiral forms involved: """"the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate"""", along with various practical approximations to them.

The article would ideally give the history of the use and adaptation of these various spiral forms.  Doing so would provide a solid illustration of how technological innovation was both necessitated and encouraged by the Age of Rail - a valuable insight into the social impact of rail.

I'm guessing that the AREMA reference probably continues on from the quote above to give some further detail about those approximations, their inventors and their history; but it may not.  In any case, can anybody provide suitable references to help flesh out this story?

 Page Macedonia recent edit wars 
Even if generally you are somewhat of an unexpressed Greek supporter, I'd like to hear your opinion on the matter: since the last consensus from 12:10, 12 November 2008 was interrupted with the POV edit """"term mainly used by Republic of Macedonia"""", with no evidence/sources submitted, this page has been a target of several disruptive editors and revert wars  ; Despite the fact that we have submitted evidence that this is not a """"term mainly used by Republic of Macedonia"""": Britannica , And many other international sources from Google Scholar  and there is not a single source or evidence that conferms this """"mainly used by Republic of Macedonia"""" this disruptive revert editors have continued to push this POV.

 Practical proposal for change based on evidence provided above 
Simple to read for assholes who refuse to read:
Proposals:
1) change phrasing in intro
2) do not change focus of the majority of the page on the """"close circle""""
3) perhaps make """"writers"""" section more reader friendly for casual readers with a chart, or something quick and simple to read
4) change naming of """"writers"""" section to something reflected broader scope
5) I would like something like 3 & 4 to be closer to the top, but I do recognize Doom's concern that it weighs down the intro, so we can see for now if it works.

I'm suggesting no change beyond that, but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change.

"There were four relatively modern heavy ships sunk, the German BC was lost to uncontrollable flooding forward.  The three British BC were lost because they were packed from the turret to the magazines with uncased cordite charges with igniter pads leaking gunpowder.  Cordite, if it began to deteriorate (and it could do so very quickly) had a tendency to explode if exposed to shock, and a shell through the turret armor would more than provide that.  So, lack of deck armor didn't have a thing to do with the loss of the British BC's.  the lack of turret face/roof armor did have a great deal to do with it, as did unsafe cordite handling.  Now had the BC's been subjected to long range plugning fire it would have been another story, however the armoring system until USS Nevada didn't provide for in any BC or Dreadnought design.",0

"HighKing 
Your closure of that ANI report is unwise at best, abusive at worst. Ample evidence of wrong doing has been provided, maybe not with respect to the BI sanction (but even that is not clear cut, given it is meant to be broadly construed), but definitely in the sense that these edits are clearly the same terminology policing behaviour that led to that sanction, but on a slightly different BI related term. Action is clearly warranted. Archived or not, as I said, I am not going to let this lie, I will be informing Cailil when he returns. In addition to sanctioning Highking, I expect he will want to take issue with you disrespecting him by completely ignoring all the effort he went to in detailing exactly what is wrong with HighKing's behaviour, and what he should be avoiding. Who I am is completely and utterly irrelevant to whether or not HighKing is ignoring those warnings and engaging in the beahviour Cailil described as being not wanted here. He even made that exact point to HighKing - while Cailil has sympathy with the so called harassment he often claims to be suffering as a way of avoiding sanctions for making these edits, Cailil was crystal clear on the point that who reports him, or even just the mere presence of suspect accounts in any of these reports/disputes, has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he will act on any poor behaviour he observes from HighKing. I know he has previously expressed frustration at seemingly being the only admin here who is prepared to deal with HighKing, and I can see why with actions like this. Your closure of the section simply because of who the complainents are has only one effect - rewarding HighKing for bad edits. It's really no skin off my nose, is it? If I am a banned user, do you think archiving that discussion will have any effect on me? Or if I am not banned but this is just not my main account, then do you think archiving the section is going to change whatever reason I might have for not posting there with my main account? Of course not. The only thing it achieves is to remove from sight as an immediate issue. Which, given the fact Cailil was at pains to point out that HighKing's poor behaviour stretches back to 2008, is not a good thing for Wikipedia. You're an admin. You're expected to deal with long term problems, not sweep them under the carpet for wholly irrelevant reasons. If HighKing were ever to end up at arbitration for example, do you think he would escape sanction for persistent WP:TE behaviour, simply because other people involved were not following some completely unrelated rule like WP:SOCK? Of course not. Hopefully you can at least appreciate that as an admin, you being the person who maintains that cycle of WP:TE, is not only bad for Wikipedia, it's a form of laxity that really isn't excused by who I may or may not be. It also had the material effect of me not being able to correct Murray on a basic point of fact, meaning the archive now has errors in it, which I am sure is not the intent of that facility. Archive or no archive, at the very least, if, or more likely when, Cailil sanctions HighKing for those edits, I expect you to hold your hands up and admit your failure to do your duty as an admin in this case. Anything less will simply fall well below the expected standards of admins on Wikipedia.

How do you not understand that you're confirming that the Babylonian empire ended in 539 when its king was called to account?!!  
Strawman. Try again  talk 

Read Jeremiah 25:12. It gives an order of events. 1) 70 years ends. 2) Babylon's king is called to account. Babylon's king was called to account in 539. Ergo, 70 years ended in 539. Ergo, 70 years of nations serving Babylon began in 609. Babylon replaced the Assyrian world power in 609.  
As I keep telling you, your exegesis is fatuous for it obviates the context of 2 Chronicles 36:20,21; Jeremiah 25:12; Zechariah 1:12; Daniel 9:2; Zechariah 7:5 and Jeremiah 29:10, among others. Try again.  talk 

 Fringe Views? 

Please desist from changing articles to match the fringe views of Jehovah's Witnesses. You might like to start a section at articles' Talk pages, however it is unlikely that you will be able to indicate any widespread support for the alternative views taught by your religion. Thanks.  

How is it fringe when they're based on accurate and reliable sources? Wikipedia is a place for truth not your noetical bigotry.   
Reliable sources indicate the widely accepted chronology of the period. They do not support the JW chronology. And you didn't even provide any sources. You will need to discuss at the article's Talk pages to reach a concensus, however there are no mainstream sources in support of your views.  

Agreed. I've reverted you again.   
You are both misinformed. According to the Cyrus Cylinder, Cyrus conquered Babylon in October 539 B.C.E. Cyrus’ first regal year began in the spring of 538 B.C.E. This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E. or “the seventh month (Tishri)” as Ezra 3:1 says.

It is a simple matter of counting back 70 years which brings us to 607 BCE for Jerusalem’s destruction. Dates other than 607 BCE ignore the statements in Scripture that the land would be desolate for 70 years. (Daniel 9:1,2)    

Looking at your other edits I'm concerned that you don't have any grasp yet of WP:NPOV. I've raised them at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Bible#Editor changes biblical dates, etc where I hope you will explain your edits. You are also failing to use WP:Edit summaries, which is sufficient reason for many people to revert you.   

Thank you for the reminder concerning the """"edit summaries"""" field.   

You said: This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E.. That is wrong. The JW conclusion that the Jews 'must' have returned the following year is entirely speculative. Josephus explicitly states that the temple foundations were laid in Cyrus second year, which means the Jews were back in his first year, which means Cyrus decree was made at the beginning of hist first year, and the Jews then had 6 months to make the 4-month journey back to Jerusalem.

 Reply to No Such User's Opinion 
Not sure if you're able to comprehend, but here are few facts to consider
Serbia was a country during Selimović's life for 19 years before Yugoslavia was (1910-1918 Kingdom of Serbia, 1918-1929 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, 1929 SCS was renamed Yugoslavia)., And it was also one of the Federal Republics of Yugoslavia. This is why on the Yugoslav censuses, """"Serb ethnicity"""" was an option, which Selimovic selected. 
The majority of the members of the Partizans and the Communists were Serbs, being a Serb and being a partizan/communist was not mutually exclusive
Your implication that he changed nationalities from Bosnian to Serbian to spite Sarajevan """"harrasment"""" is ridiculous because he was not addressing his nationality in the letter, but rather his ethnicity, which is an unchangeable characteristic.
The Serbian language's standardization was devised by Karadzic in 1818, 17 years before the Croatian latin alphabet was standardized by Ljudevit Gaj, and 32 years before Serbo-Croatian was devised at the Vienna agreement. If you read Mesa Selimovic's books you would know that the modern standardized Serbian language is older than both modern standardized Croatian and Serbocroatian as he wrote a book discussing Karadzic's reforms. Also there are Croatian and Serbo-Croatian dialects that are not mutually understandable with the modern standardized Serbian that Selimovic wrote in, namely Cakavian and Kajkavian.
You say Biographies are reliable sources. Then read this excerpt from Selimovic's own autobiography """"Sjecanja"""" that he wrote himself and you will find the following quotation: """"Potičem iz muslimanske porodice iz Bosne, a po nacionalnoj pripadnosti sam Srbin. Pripadam srpskoj literaturi"""" -> TRANSLATION: I COME FROM A MUSLIM FAMILY FROM BOSNIA, BUT BY ETHNICITY I AM A SERB. I BELONG TO SERBIAN LITERATURE

 Swastika as a mnemonic device http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html 

The article needs more information about the swastika's use as a modern mnemonic device. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Rex Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by the National Socialist German workers Party as alphabetic symbolism, including meshed """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism."""" The leader of German National Socialists at that time altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  Professor Curry showed that many modern myths use a false belief that Nazis called themselves """"Nazis.""""  The myths cause widespread ignorance of the eytmology of the word """"Nazi."""" Party members called themselves """"National Socialists,"""" not """"Nazis.""""  Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas use the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not call their symbol a """"swastika.""""  Another person conceded the point with the comment that """"It does seem to be the case that the National Socialist German Workers' Party originated the 45° orientation...."""" though they did not necessarily originate that use, the German National Socialists did independently alter their use of the symbol for their specific desire to highlight the """"S"""" letter for """"socialism."""" Of course, the additional comment that they didn't use the 45 degree orientation consistently also concedes Professor Curry's work showing that their leader deliberately altered / evolved the symbol from its historic orientation into meshed """"S"""" letters for socialism. The graphic resonance is highly suggestive... and in fact it is compelling! In fact, one of the flags that Dr. Curry cites argues for that thesis: The swastika itself comprises two S's, and that is shown to have been known consciously when the German National Socialists overlay two additional S's for another group (as German National Socialists had other examples of similar alphabetic symbolism). Hitler even altered his own signature to reflect the same """"S"""" for socialism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html The leader of the German Socialists had no reason to harp on this idea because he was an ex-artist. Nevertheless, he did allude to the alphabetic symbolism in his own comments in his notorious book. Of course, he would not drone on about it just as he did not drone on about what the stylized """"SA"""" symbol meant, or the side-by-side """"SS"""" symbol, or the """"VW"""" (all of which other writers concede for some inconsistent reason). The only reason it is so hard for most people to understand today is because they have been trained to use the hackneyed shorthand for the Party and most people are ignorant of the name of the actual Party, and thus have no idea that the Party actually espoused a dogma that they called """"Socialism."""" Even to this day, people repeatedly delete Dr. Curry's work in an effort to perpetuate the ignorance and the myths.""",0

"Hi Mary. I'm not going to bother adding anything to the Trance page, as that fellow Roux and his minions monitor what I say, to silence it before the public gets to read it. I suspect this has to do with the somewhat decline in Trance popularity starting in 2008. Last year I would go on this page to write about the trends of Trance, and they experienced a backlash, as their chosen leader (Armin) had not lost the polls yet. They couldn't believe that the trends could possibly be changing for the next generation in the dance scene. They experienced personal feelings of hatred towards me, thinking I was a House only propagator. In reality I am actually a Trance DJ, but don't tell them this, as it makes the whole situation even more fun for me. That said, there is no point in me adding stuff to the page because it will be deleted. I am currently writing a very complicated article on dance music if you want to proof read it, find a way to provide me with an e-mail address if you want.

The history of Trance is very complicated. For one thing, to put it simply, Trance isn't really a genre of music. (I hate to put it this bluntly and it kind of sounds crazy). This is why you can't find information. The Snoman section on Trance in his published book is mostly false hopes. When people do write about it, it is often from the perspective of industry interests who have equity stakes in the genre, so they often 'invent information' in attempts to keep the label in the media. Most of these clever music terms are the inventions of the English ) Sneaky buggers.

As Armin puts it, it is more 'A state of trance' like his show is titled. This observation is correct. It doesn't matter what its called, as long as its good. What he means when he says Trance is a state of mind, is that it is not some formulaic equation that determines what is and what isn't. All of these labels are just styles and buzz-words. You will find difficulty locating written information on Trance because it is just another offshoot of House, one of the many. The articles that you will find are probably from punters who came out of the Tiesto generation. Tiesto is in fact a House DJ, but don't tell punters this, or they may commit suicide. Many have currently experienced heart attacks or early menopause, when they found out Tiesto went back to a House sound now. Good Luck.",0

This sound can be collectively referred to as I’ve Got Gloria, a band that is set to take charge of the Niagara pop punk scene.
For years, I’ve Got Gloria has been revamping, rearranging; honing its own sound if you will. Making the progression away from its post-core beginnings in favor of a more female friendly, get your panties wet, rush the stage/strip us naked and have your way with us type of sound. Having shared the stage with the likes of From Man In Ghost, Ten Second Epic, The Midway State, Tonight Tonight, & Everlea, has only added to the ever growing list of influences making our sound that much more distinct. The band has quite literally been Rebuilt, as the name as well as the subject matter of their debut EP describes.

""":::: But in what sense can that comment possibly be “correct”? """"Provided that what is sourced is already in the article""""! I can't let that pass, as it is just so damaging - so I'm going to say a few things. You cannot just ‘summarise’ any old group of citations (sometime creating a new thing altogether in doing so - which is excempt from needing proof) – you are absolutely obliged to consider WP:weight, along with other of the many guidelines like WP:red flag in Verifiability, and Notability too. Weight alone will more often than not dictate the new text, as it has done now. 

These retentive methods of ‘Style reviewing’ are a plague across the full scope of Wikipedia, and this article highlights the foolishness (too long maintained) of methodically tick-boxing inherently illogical style-correctness, whilst routinely (ie as a kind of 'policy') ignoring content( which is ironically seen as the job of the editors, who actually get sidelined in the process). In teh past I've seen so many foolish paragraphs pass though ‘style’, even in Featured Articles (another content-shy process believe it or not). There really is nothing clever about being so clinical when it leads to plain misrepresentation, especially with a subject like this. Many non-British would will be mislead by the text on a basic ‘reader’ level here anyway, which just adds more irony to the process of course . As a rule, it is good to consider what you are doing in life in anyway, regardless of your job.

What happened in Nick Griffin is that simple event-verifying  citations from within the article (the few cases of Griffin being invited to speak at mainstream establishments) were converted into a kind of super-flexible ‘source’ material’, which (in that new state) were easily moulded into the stand-alone line """"Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""" I strongly suspect that no one got a shoe-in to actually add any weight, due to the rigid system involved - where new  content is demoted in value, and even at times discouraged. I’ve seen it happen too often, it’s just plain dumb. What’s worse, a general ethos of ‘protecting the result’ comes from the process, which ended here in me being accused of ‘vandalism’ for attempting change, which I really object to. It really is dumb.

Imagine someone collecting a handful of citations of various people expressing an opinion (shall we say of black people being inferior to whites?) and places them in a relevant section in an article (say a """"Controversy"""" section in a new and developing article called """"Racism"""") . According to Wikipedia’s Style Council, this line inserted at the end of the intro would theoretically be fine: """"Many people believe that black people are inferior to whites”. As there was nothing in the developing article about the many issues surrounding IQ test and the reading of them both past and present, no balance is made, and the Intro passes with flying colours. The new authorised version is then considered as ‘passing consensus’ – a broadly finished thing that is duly protected from change.

The Intro equation I’ve seen many times is: X (citations of comments existing somewhere i n the article) = Z (a new flexible ‘source’ material  when grouped) = Y (a new and uncited statement of fact, based on the new entity of the ‘source’). THE INNER WORKINGS OF ‘SUMMARY’ ARE SIMPLY NOT APPARENT TO THE TYPICAL WIKIPEDIA READER, who is always at the very bottom of the Wikipedia heap, just below the general editor.

Articles like Nick Griffin can be difficult and need creative work on the edit level - but that is the point. So much time on Wikipedia is wasted on stylising incomplete articles and weak unbalanced text. It is no way to bypass edit conflict - that ‘’’has’’’ to be done the hard way, such as in finding ways to express weight. Risking edit battles is far superior to squeezing down to make-shift style-approved articles that are subsequently protected from change. Here that process made the introduction bland, weak and misleading, and the added factor of the subject's inherent extremity ensured the article became seriously misleading – to the point that the article became Nick Griffin-friendly, and hence ultimate",0

Firstly, The concept of """"state terrorism"""" as it applies to declared war is inherently fringe. The USA and the Empire of Japan were engaged in a declared war.

While many so called experts feel that the Dan Brown book Da Vinci Code's
idea that Jesus had children via Mary Magdalene is preposterous , this idea has been carefully explored in detail for anyone to consider ... including the many many proofs down through time that he did in fact have children; and unlike the Da Vinci Code's fictional claim Jesus has only one descendant today, the number would be very large 80 generations later or today.

 sockpuppets 

Wikipedia has always been biased, starting from the top (Jimbo Wales ran an Ayn Rand mailing list for years, said """"[Friedrich] Hayek’s work...is central to my own thinking about how to manage the Wikipedia project."""" etc.) on down, it used to pretend it was fair and balanced though.  I was accused for years of having sock puppets.  As things went downhill here (or uphill from their perspective), they began checking into the accusations of the wing nuts that I had sock puppets, and repeatedly found nothing.  Finally, things degenerated to the point where David Gerard, who has checkuser privileges, claimed I was someone named User:Mr. Know-It-All.  I have no association with Mr. Know-It-All, but even that aside, there is no rule on Wikipedia that you can't have multiple accounts.  So he claimed we had voted on multiple RFA's together, and due to that I was put on probation.  Well, a simple comparison of two pages of the RFA's I and he voted on can be done, and it can be seen that his claim there were multiple RFA's the two accounts voted on is false, or that Me and Mr. KIA ever voted on the same RFA ever, not even one, never mind the multiple he said happened.  The rules say he had to post the links in the page, but since the links did not exist, since the charge was false, that didn't happen.  So they broke their own rules of prosecution, presenting no evidence, and then convicted me on a charge where anyone comparing two pages in the space of a minute can see is false.  Of course my pointing this out before the case was closed was completely ignored.  Basically, I followed the rules but they didn't like my politics so I was punished for that.  The leaps of logic where strange too - I tried to point out that the US supported the """"Khmer Rouge"""" after 1979, which somehow made me responsible for everyone who died in Cambodia prior to 1979.  And that sort of thing.

Wikipedia is what it is, thinking you can fix it is like thinking you can fix Fox News by leaving comments in their web site comments section before they're erased.  Demopedia and dKosopedia or something of that ilk might become an alternative.  If Wikipedia was run by a normal person it might have things centralized, but porn magnate turned Friedrick von Hayek Randroid Jimbo Wales is not that person.  """,0

"Editing the reference to satanism from the Ayn Rand article. 

There seems to be some confusion about the exact nature of a neutral point of view with regard to the Wikipedia cannon. Neutrality is not a licence to assert associations and intimate linkages that otherwise would require rigorous argument and analysis.

As a philosopher, I well know that neutrality cuts both ways. This protects against assertions that in fact serve hidden agendas such as attempts to sneak in legitimacy for unspeakable perversions like satanism and pedophilia. Again, the prohibition, explicit in the Wikipedia discussion of neutrality, is precisely against such brazen assertionism.

I agree with your ideas about comprehensible articles on physics. I was a physics major in a major university for a couple years, eventually broadened out to other things, but I can still read Pauli and Reichenbach without feeling that I got caught in the spin cycle of a rug washer. The same isn't true of the Wikipedia physics articles.

I've tried to clear up the philosophy of QM article that is under rfd, but Mr. Ingham has not answered my questions about what he is trying to say in a responsive way. The """"simplified"""" article looks like a better place to start.

My experience in physics at the University level may be relevant. We had a trimester system. The first trimester was mechanics. I did o.k., but calculus was new to me. The second semester was electricity. Since I had shocked myself working on old radios, made crystal radios, etc., etc. for years, I already knew what was going on. In some ways I was ahead of our grad student lab leader, who couldn't understand why putting one probe of a volt meter into the DC outlet on the lab bench did not produce a reading. My grade jumped to A, not because I was any smarter, but because I knew from experience what happens when resistors are wired in series and when they are wired in parallel, and to other students such matters were totally abstract. I think that students should begin with real-world experiences as much as possible. Unfortunately, many students live in very restricted environments. If you live in a high-rise apartment building you might not realize you could just trail the antenna for a crystal radio out the window.

 ******* Double Standard Against Bosniaks *********** 

ChrisO doesn't want me to use copy of the original investigative article that was published in 1993 by David Bernstein (Pacific News Service). The reason is because he thinks this is a personal website http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html . What difference does it make? It's still original article published 13 years ago by Pacific News Service with full copyright notice? http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html

Anyways, balkanpeace.org is Serb-run website in which Bosniaks, Croats and other ethnic groups are portrayed as the worst of the worst, while Serb crimes are excused.

One more thing - if I stop being active here, then you will know that they banned me. And if that happens, it will be clear example of pro-Serb one-sidedness and double-standard that is attempting to plague this very important article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre .

I urge ChrisO to protect Srebrenica Massacre article in a same way Israel's article is protected http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel .

And remember: Srebrenica massacre article is not about Serbs or pro-Serb lobbyists such as General Lewis Mackenzie. Srebrenica massacre article is about 8,000+ victims of genocide. Let's focus on the victims and honor them.

How would you feel if you lost your children, mother, grandmother, grandfather and all people that you loved and lived for? Ask yourself this question every time you edit Srebrenica massacre article. Search for love and compassion in your heart, you will find it.

In 1982, he joined Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle as the Director of Marketing. After a business trip to Milan, Italy, he tried to get ownership (including Gerry Baldwin) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide and Howard Schultz started his own coffee shop named Il Giornale in 1985. Two years later, the original Starbucks management were forced to focus on Peet's Coffee & Tea because of bullying and harrassment and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale. The former owners do not speak favorably of Schultz in interviews to this day.

Schultz renamed Il Giornale with the Starbucks name and aggressively expanded Starbucks' reach across the United States. It can be said that Starbucks popularized espresso drinks such as the cafe latte to many Americans who had previously only ever tasted freeze dried coffee.They later acquired HEAR music and formed Concord Management Group in an attempt at music management and distribution using Starbucks stores. Schultz also became a board member on Dreamworks, trying to establish film output.He began his obsession with Angelina Jolie when she was at a very young age and saw to it that she rose to the celebrity status in her career. It is rumored that the success of the Ray Charles cd fueled Schultz' ambition to murder Charles in an attempt to secure the success of the film. Over the years, he is linked to the deaths of other actors such as Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole Smith, Tupac Shakur, and Notorious BIG. Unfortunately, he is affiliated with a secret group called *Velvet Mafia* in Hollywood. They are rumored to be gay, be responsible for removing Michael Ovitz from his CAA post with a huge power move and stalks young women and men for years to get ideas for their projects. Other members includes David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenburg, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, and Michael Eisner amongst some others. This has earned him a bad reputation within the Hollywood community. His latest effort to bring his company back on track, he has unaffiliated himself from Concord Management and Dreamworks. However, Starbucks employees have been neglected, mistreated, stalked, harrassed, smeared and defamed under Schultz's management and have repeatedly plagued the company with multi million dollar lawsuits and won. The latest smear attempt came when a 16 year old barista was sexually harrassed by Starbucks management in Irvine, California. In his recent Portfolio magazine in July 2008, he responded to his employees calling him a *psychopath* by suggesting that they should just listen to what the leader of their company tells them. Schultz didn't believe in franchising. Because of this Starbucks owns every domestic outlet with one exception. Schultz went 50-50 with Magic Johnson on stores in minority communities. Others believe the reason why he doesn't franchise I'd because he would like to have access to the video recordings of his employees for private use.

Schultz co-authored a book called Pour Your Heart into It that expounds on his life journey with Starbucks. In his book Schultz admits that he was afraid that """"Starbucks may become another souless big chain."""" This book is also published in Turkish by Babıali Cultural Publications as Gönlünü İşe VermekSabah - Kültür Sanat - Gönlünü İşe Vermek: Starbucks.

Schultz is also the former owner of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. On July 17,2006, it was announced that Schultz sold the team to a group of businessmen from Oklahoma City for $350 million. It was speculated that the new owners would move the team to Oklahoma City some time after the 2006-2007 NBA season.seattletimes.nwsource.com. URL last accessed July 18, 2006. On July 3, 2008, the City of Seattle reached a settlement with the new ownership group and the Sonics did, in fact, move to Oklahoma City.

A lot of this coverage is over at Cyclone Nargis.  Sadly, there just isn't a lot of information out there since access to the country is so tightly controlled, and even the assessment teams on the ground probably don't have the information we'd expect to see.  

 Name 

in the article, some parts say Burma, and some say Myanmar.

I think we should calll it Myanmar, since it may not be recognized by many countries, but that is the official (inter)national name.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Please read the tag at the top of the page.  The name is under dispute.  

 Moved the Page Move Protection tag to talk page 

There isn't really a need for the tag to be on the article itself. As was successfully argued regarding the """"dispute tag"""" previously, the tag itself doesn't help the article, and it being on the talk page achieves the same end.  

Having a warning on the front page shows that the article is in a state of flux.  Anyone who isn't particularly wiki-savvy wouldn't realize that there is an ongoing dispute and that the current version may well change in the near future.  The """"non-endorsement"""" of the current name of the article is a reasonable point to make.  I don't particularly care for either name, but making it look stable when it's unclear is kind of misleading to the reader.  

You're not making a lot of sense. The first sentence of the article notes the naming of the country. I believe you were involved with the discussion regarding the """"Dispute"""" tag, and it came to the point where the only sensible solution was to have it on the talk page. The same applies with this tag. It has nothing to do with honesty and I'd be insulted if I didn't assume good faith. Please reconsider your reversion, the last thing I want is an edit war of any sort.  

Look at the discussion on this page regarding the name dispute tag.  I wouldn't say that there was a consensus that removing the tag was the only """"sensible solution"""".
The statement is true and not misleading.  Neither staying nor moving are WP:SNOWBALL.
Protection tags are usually on the front page of the article.  See WP:PROTECT#Other_notes for talk page templates.
The tag deflects mastodons: Having the tag on the article itself sends a clear message to people who might just assume that the name is wrong and move it.
The tag shows that the current name of the article is not a consensus statement: Not having the tag implies to a casual reader that the current name is appropriate (not the current consensus because there is no consensus).
It seems kind of redundant to you or me since we've been staring at it for the last couple of weeks, but to someone who is not already involved it shows that the article is not stable.  I mean, I really don't care that much, but why is it so critical to take it off?

Something to consider, is that the references you pointed to – which are part of a larger list  are very old and are based on work done in the early years of AIDS; also, that subsequent research has not supported the same results.

The primary issue when reviewing the studies most often referenced by someone trying to link nitrites to AIDS, or more specifically to Kaposi’s sarcaoma, is that they are very weak in terms of data presented.  The results have not been repeated by other scientists.  In fact, within the list of referenced studies, there are contradictory results both by the same researcher and between different researchers.

The general consensus in the research community, and in the HIV/AIDS community, is that although the much vaunted list of references claiming to link nitrites to HIV/AIDS may look impressive to the untrained eye, they do not support a case for a claim that nitrite use causes HIV infection or Kaposi’s sarcaoma (KS).",0

I agree that Raven has has a lot to do with the sucess of this group. I really do. But I also think that keeping the girl in Walt Disney Records was a bad choice for a debut album. Walt Disney Records is obviously going to cath much mainstream attention, with the exception of the soundtracks of the CG movies and HSM.

I also think that adding another girl for the movie would be a good idea, but not to the group, unless it invloves a reality show. The show would catch some attention for the girls, even if it failed and could possibly boost them more than they even are.I also think that them opening an official MySpace page did something too. A lot of people access MySpace and they could attract more fans that way.

Also, I have been wondering if you noticed at all the Cheetah Sisters: Barcelona Mix on the Cheetah Girls 2 soundtrack. If you have a chance, listen to that song for me. It does not include Raven. It was re-recorded for this soundtrack. There are also rumors of a Greatest Hits album to be in the works after their Hollywod Records debut is avalible for some time. And since, they re-recorded Cheetah Sisters as an actual group, without Raven, I am asuming that if a Greatest Hits album does eventually come along, it will be full of re-recorded material that does not include Raven. If you also bought the Cheetah Girls Party's Just Begun Tour book, you will see that there is a photospread in there, and one of the pictures originally containted Raven.

Look on the main page for this group and find their picture. That image has been photoshopped. In that version, used to promote the tour and the soundtrack, they made it look as if they were all standing together originally. They weren't. Raven was standing in between of Adrienne and Sabrina. In the book, a picture from that same photoshoot was included and the lyrics to Strut replaced Raven's body.

I think that Hollywood Records is making it very clear that raven has nothing to do with The Cheetah Girls and probably never will again. I can also assume that the girls not want to have anything to do with her...well, they do not want to be tied to her. Raven has said that she is done with Disney after her """"Adventures in Babysitting"""" remake, since she does not want to be tied down to """"a kid franchise"""". I am assume that this upset Disney and now their are rumors of Raven being dropped from Hollywood Records and moved to Arista Records, which would explain the delay in her album release.

""", you're infringing owner B. However if picture A is out of copyright you can take your picture C of it, and picture C is your copyright. Which I think is why art galleries ban cameras - they want to sell you their postcards (I think this is right)  

 """"Exactly Chevin"""", Thanks...Watch out Boothy doesn't start staulking and deleteing your stuff w/o taking the burden of proof there is a copyright... 

 Which picture?   Incidentally I'm writing about UK law. American law used to be marginally different. For instance to have copyright in the UK you only have show your work to someone, whereas in America I think you have to send it to the Library of Congress - books anyway. Also you used to have claim copyright separately in different countries. Then there's publishing rights, a whole different can of worms.

 I think that a picture such as Image:Pottsville court house.gif is liable to be a double copyvio - of the original postcard (if still in copyright) and of the gif image.

"""::You mean there are times on Wikipedia where someone doesn't have grounds to complain about another person's conduct? I've yet to see it. Perhaps if you took the time to review what I've had to deal with, you might understand why I am in the mood I am in. So far, my experience of Wikipedia has been anything but one of collaboration. At various times and by various people, I have been completely ignored, I have been told I am or I do things I provably do not, I have been told provably false things about what Wikipedia's rules supposedly say, and I have had to endure several people telling me all about a subject they clearly know absolutely nothing about, to the point where they are making quite ridiculous claims about how long it would take to write an article to their satisfaction (and obviously, the two of those are linked - people who know nothing about the subject or the media that covers it, aren't likely to have the first clue how long it would take to find and summarise that media, are they?). Apparently though, judging by the fact none of that has attracted any warnings for their conduct, I suppose all of this is completely normal here, and it's just me who is in the wrong for complaining about any of this by referring to people's actual names. So be it I guess. I'm struggling to see how me slowing down is going to change that. It appears to be hard-wired behaviour. I'm afraid that what you may or may not appreciate is that people like Dave are always going to feel insulted when the truth is told - when it's pointed out to them that the facts tell quite a different story about whether or not their claim to be a """"bus enthusiast"""" are remotely true - or when it's pointed out that their claim to have """"literally"""" found no results on Google doesn't stand up to basic scrutiny. Similarly, people like Charles, who are quite clearly only interested in trolling and annoying people, will always act like jerks whenever people follow up their 'reading advice' with questions which expose the fact that their advice appears to be based on nothing contained in the reading material at all. I'm really not sure why any of this needs to actually be raised at an administrator's 'noticeboard' before any notice of it is actually taken. Laziness/disinterest is all I can think of. There certainly seems to be a complete disinterest about the fact articles like NIBS are disappearing from Wikipedia based on absolutely nothing, certainly nothing that subject experts would agree was good reasoning. Still, this is all now being swept under the carpet because of the perfectly normal behaviour on Wikipedia - don't like what the other guy says? Ignore him and he'll go away. If he doesn't go away, complain loudly (and in a completely hypocritical manner in the case of Dave) in the hope someone gets rid of him for you.

"""Haplogroup L lineages are relatively infrequent(less than 1%) throughout Europe with the exception of Iberia, where frequencies as high as 11.7% percent have been reported. These lineages had previously been associated with the African slave trade. However an analysis by Gonzalez et al revealed that most of the L lineages matched Northwest African L lineages rather than contemporary Sub-Saharan L lineages. The authors suggest this pattern indicates that most of the Sub-Saharan L lineages entered Iberia in prehistoric times rather than in more recent periods. 

Haplogroup L lineages are present at low frequencies in Eastern Europe. Though a high diversity of African mtDNA lineages have been detected, few lineages have accumulated enough mutations in Europe to form monophyletic clusters. Malyarchuk et al 2005 detected only two monophyletic clusters, L1b and L3b, in Russians with an estimated age no greater than 6,500 years. Malyarchuk et al 2008 identified African L1b, L2a, L3b, L3d and M1 clades in slavic populations at low frequencies. L1b, L3b and L3d had matches with West African populations, indicating that these lineages probably entered Europe through Iberia. One lineage L2a1a, appeared to be much older, indicating that it may have entered Europe in prehistoric times. This clade was possibly related to L2a1 clades identified in 10 individuals of Ashkenazi heritage from France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Russia. L2a lineages are widespread throughout Africa, as a result, the exact origins of this lineage are uncertain.

"Just look at the stuff about David Irving and how many times the author tries to smear this honourable historian, whose book 'Hitlers War' from 1977 was compulsery reading at West Point and Sandhurst. This really says a lot of the extent of authority as Mr. Irving enjoyed (then). He is still widely believed to be one of the greatest authorities on WW2 and of the nature of the Nazi regime. All this still stands, as everyone can witness for himself by reading some of his books, which are available free of charge from his website as Downloads.

However ONE chapter of the aforementioned book was about the holocaust. And because of that David got subjected to a smearing campaign hitherto unseen in scope. Booksellers was pressured not to sell his books (no mention of this on Wikipedia) - that is why he gives them away for free. Whereever he goes in the world he find arrangements cancelled ib short notice, the hotelliers or universities being pressed to pull the event.

I find David irving to be a good and honourable englishman. His father was naval officer who took part in The Battle of Jutland. You cannot find ANY factual fault in his work. If you can David is the first who wants to know - email him.

By the way, he do not deny the holocaust, which is why your Wikipedia entry is so wrong. He find the whole subject boring, but hardpresset he will tell you that it should be spelled with a small h as there were many holocausts, poles,russians,gypsies and others got killed. Civilians allways get caught out in war, but it is undeniable that the Nazi regime was especially brutal.

 To be a folk without a homeland living among a majority is allways a precaurious situation to be in in times of unrest, or so history has proven many times.

You: No.
Editor #2: I think the article should say that.
You: NO NO NO! [refer to something that supports your view on what the article should say] Period. End of discussion.
Editor #2: But...
You: I don't want to hear it. You're WRONG.

It has seemed like that for a while. You disagree with a majority of people, and it's getting a bit disruptive in my view. Don't claim ownership on the article JAF, others are free to edit it. Your opinion doesn't control it.   
Why don't you check the other articles I created - I don't interfere that much. Spore is just an article that people want to add wrong information to. And it isn't my opinion.

[page 33] Cowan's investigations at the Roger's Shelters (Po-26 and Po-27) and the Haystack Shelter (Po-47A and B) have provided ethnobotanical analyses of materials obtained under more controlled conditions.  Radiocarbon dates from the Roger's Shelters indicate the site was occupied between the fifth and seventh centuries A.D., and Cowan (1976:97-98) postulates a similar timespan [page 34] for the Haystack Shelter occupation.  Plant food remains from the site include six species of nuts (black walnut, butternut, hickory, chestnut, acorn and hazelnut), four species of fruits (pawpaw, sumac, plum and grape), and four or five possible cultigens (squash or pumpkin, bottle gourd, marsh elder, sunflower, and canary grass).  No corn was recovered.  Fragments of cane basketry, prepared bark, and cordage were also collected (Cowan 1976:87-101).

[page 36] Cowan conducted limited test excavations at two of the bottomland sites (Po-31 and Po-42) in 1974.  One of these sites (the Martin Site, Po-42) produced roughened surface pootery which is similar to ceramics from the Levisa Fork in the extreme Eastern Mountains (Cowan 1976:73-82)...In 1973, members of the Red River Historical Society and volunteers from the university of Kentucky, Department of Anthropology conducted excavations at Mf-32, a single-component Fort Ancient rockshelter site.  Materials recovered included corn husks, cordage, cut cane, two species of nuts, and shell tempered pottery, in addition to lithic materials.  The depth of the deposit (approximately 10-15 cm) suggested a relatively short-term occupancy (Cowan 1975:101-102).  Unfortunately, the materials from Mf-32 have not yet been analyzed and reported.

[page 50] This page notes that Cowan's 1975 survey, undertaken in response to changes in plans for the reservoir, gained stratigraphic information on a multicomponent Archaic site (Po-17) in the valley.  Cowan returned the following year to complete testing at Po-17 and Po-42, and to initiate excavation at Po-47B, a Woodland rockshelter site.  The data recovered from Po-17 confirmed Cowan's 1973 stratigraphic sequence and provided valuable information on the transition between the Late Archaic and Early Woodland cultures in [page 51] the Red River valley (Cowan 1976:ii).  Excavations at the Haystack Shelter (Po-47B), a Late Woodland dry shelter site, uncovered a large quantity of well-preserved organic remains.  Split cane basketry fragments, plant fiber cordage, leather, quids, paleofeces, and numerous plant food remains including both native and exotic cultigens were among the specimens recovered",0

The two paragraphs about the Christian allegorical theme about love and the two brides being based on two meanings of love, which relate to the latin words """"amor"""" and """"veritas"""" seems contradictory to the fact that the story is, apparently based, on a """"Russian-Jewish folktale.""""

Although the Christian/Jewish contradiction may be attributed to the relationship between the two religions, the fact that the entire thing is made clear by the fact that the meanings of love """"come out better in Latin"""" raises a few red flags for me. Hell, Russian isn't even a Romance language.

On top of all that, I can find no evidence that Theophile Guerin ever existed, or his 1836 book about a monk and a dead woman.

It's very interesting as an idea, but since this information of Guerin is given rather than a citation, I say that the entire two paragraphs should be IMMEDIATELY deleted.

However, I've already spent too much time writing all this and researching that, and am too unsure to actually delete it.

If i get around to rechecking this discussion and no one has said anything or disagreed, I will edit the entry, as there is no citation and it seems unfactual and invented  fictional.

"Alaeddin Keykubad 
Hi Angus! Do you think it would be a good idea to open a new proposal for the articles on the three Seljuk sultans named Alaeddin Keykubad to be titled under their correct form? You had brought in your interventions in a macro-cosmical manner during the last two caucuses, which is why I am seeking your opinion before else.

To Aeusoes1 - Rewriting content, with no knowledge of the particular topic, and without looking at any sources, as you admit to doing, is the ANTITHESIS of what Wikipedia contributors should be doing. The majority of the article's content is careful paraphrasing of information from the sources. That is supplemented by quotations. Paraphrases are essentially careful re-wordings of quotes. When you, with no knowledge of the source texts, significantly change the paraphrases, you might as well be changing the direct quotes.

As for WP:BOLD, it states:
""""... but don't be reckless!""""
""""If you expect or see a disagreement with your version of the article, and you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, it's a good idea to list your objections one by one in the talk page, reasonably quoting the disputed phrases, explaining your reasoning and providing solid references."""" [italic added]
""""Then, wait for responses for at least a day: people edit Wikipedia in their spare time and may not respond immediately. If no one objects, proceed, but always move large deletions to the Talk page and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page.""""

You wrote: """"I really don't see how your knowledge of Hawaiian is relevant to my edits"""". Because I have near-native fluency in Hawaiian, as well as a PhD in Linguistics, I know that your uninformed attempts to rewrite the description of word stress, throwing out """"D"""" as a symbol for diphthong, are doomed to failure. For example, you made it have """"3. (C)VV"""" as a stress unit. If V expands as a diphthong, then """"wiuiu"""" can result - an impossible stress unit in Hawaiian. That's only ONE of MANY errors your edits cause.

More importantly, your rewrite is not supported by any sources. You failed to cite any references, and admitted that you don't care to look at any.

You wrote: """"My edits were all about format and not substance"""". That is false. See the preceding two paragraphs. Your rewrite of the word-stress content is substance, not format.

You wrote the phrase """"blindly revert"""" to describe my restoration of the original version. My revert of your edits is informed, not """"blind"""". I've seen an edit summary you wrote in the history of another phonology page where you made the same accusation against another user who undid your edits.

You point to the """"layout"""" of other phonology pages, calling it """"precedent"""". However, the Russian (RUS), Arabic (ARA), Romanian (ROM), Polish (POL), and Danish (DAN) phonology articles are not in compliance with Wikipedia guides. POL and DAN have no lead section. The leads of RUS, ARA, and ROM, violate WP:LEAD. None of those articles use boldface properly. ROM and POL have no references at all. RUS has only 2 old refs, ARA only 1 old ref. DAN has 8. None of those articles have even ONE CITATION to a reference. The """"layout"""" of those pages is not consistent.

In contrast, the Hawaiian phonology article (HAW), as originated by me, has a proper lead section, proper use of boldface, 8 references, and 70 citations to those references. HAW is one of the best-supported linguistics articles currently on Wikipedia.

 Kid Buu is The Strongest Form of Buu 

Kid Buu is the strongest and the original form of Majin Buu which is clearly stated by the Supreme or East Kaioshin which ever you prefer to call him. So please stop changing it saying he's the weakest of the forms he's clearly not the weakest form he beats up Goku, Vegeta, and Majin Buu at the same time. He doesn't even get tired matter of fact he gets bored and waits for Goku to get up and starts fighting him again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Except, you know, Kid Buu is not the strongest form of Buu. The Kaioshin stated Kid Buu is Majin Buu's original form, and he's at his most DANGEROUS like this, not the most powerful. There are many, many instances that outright prove that Super Buu and his various forms are more powerful than Kid Buu. 

Saying he beats up Goku, Vegeta and the weakest form of Majin Buu at the same time is hardly proof that Kid Buu is strongest. ANY version of Majin Buu save for possibly Fat Buu could have done that easily. In fact, Goku outright states that if he and Vegeta were to fight Super Buu while at their most powerful, they would die. Yet, when Buu reverted back to his original """"Kid Buu"""" form, they were no longer worried, and Goku KNEW he could defeat him on his own.

Hell, he and Vegeta even played rock, paper, scissors in order to decide who wiould fight him first. That's how unafraid they were. 

Look, just because you like Kid Buu best doesn't mean he's the strongest. It was stated that Kid Buu is the most unpredicatable, violent and wild of all the forms. Why isn't that good enough for you?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 74.245.133.209   

Sorry but I don't do favortism I tell it like it is. I took he time to watch the entire Kid Buu saga and he is clearly the strongest form. If you would take the time and recall Goku begged Kid Buu to stong with his death ball attack and Kid Buu smiled because he knew Goku couldn't stop it. This just begins the fact that Goku couldn't beat Kid Buu by himself if he could have he would have turned Super Saiyan 3 and gave it his all to stop Kid Buu from blowing up the Earth. Also he even forced Goku to lose his Super Saiyan 3 transformation which caused Vegeta to step in and fight. He also caught the spirit bomb which had Gohan's, and all the other Z fighters including all the people of Earth and the Namekians. No matter how crazy you are if you can't deal with power it will overcome u which was not the case with Kid Buu he took is seriously and started pushing the bomb back. He would have succeeded if there had not been 1 wish left and Goku would have possibly been killed. So how about you watch over and over again and realize that Kid Buu is the strongest form, crazy doesn't give you the ability to beat people up it just means that you have no rationale which he doesn't have but no matter how crazy you are if you don't have the power than you can't dish it out.

I would think the problem is that egg-rolls and spring rolls are clearly two different things but the numbers of differences can very.

On the main egg-roll article, there is a citation that links to an article written by no less of an authority than Chinese-American chef Martin Yan.  There Yan details the main difference between the two.  Egg-rolls have eggs as part of the wrapper, along with wheat flour and water.  Spring rolls just have the wheat flour and water. 

This one ingredient different causes several changes.  The inclusion of the eggs causes egg-rolls to be darker, slightly chewer and with a rougher outer texture.  Spring rolls, with the lack of egg, fry up slightly crispier with a lighter color and a smoother outer texture.  All of this is directly from Chef Yan, not myself, so it can be taken as authoritative.

And all that is clear enough.  The problem or confusion if you will, most often centers around the filling and the size.  At this point, we mostly have personal experience.  Your average Chinese restaurant in America is bound to have a dish called an egg-roll.  This egg roll is going to have the wrapper made from egg, wheat flour and water.  It will be filled with assorted vegetables and a protein.  The protein can be shrimp, pork, chicken or a combination of shrimp and pork.  The differences in the protein are often regional, with some areas only having shrimp and/or pork while other areas only having chicken.  The size can also be different as well depending on how thick or thin the cook rolls the egg-roll out.  I've seen egg-rolls thicker than manicotti or as thin as spring rolls.  The only thing uniform is the color and texture as the effects of the egg in the wrapper are consistent.  In addition it might be worth mentioned that egg-rolls are a far more common sight than spring rolls on the menus of such restaurants but that might be somewhat off-topic. 

We could say, as Mr. Colin McLarty writes above, that another key difference is that many consider egg-rolls as having meat (protein) with vegetables as a filling, while spring rolls only have vegetables.  And to be sure, I have never seen spring rolls anywhere in the US with any protein in the filing.  And when you order a egg-roll in a Americanized Chinese restaurant, it will contain some sport of protein.  However, one can find a curious thing in the frozen foods section of America supermarkets everywhere throughout the country.  Vegetable egg-rolls.  They are not spring rolls as they are made with the wrapper that contains egg and from the outside they look just like the egg-rolls that are sold right next to them.  But yet while you can find them in supermarkets coast-to-coast, I personally have yet to see them in any Chinese restaurant. 

Of course, all of this does not touch upon the tendency of Vietnamese restaurants in the US to call Goi cuon """"spring rolls"""".  One can only assume such a decision is to make an ethic menu, without a typical spring roll on it, more appealing non-Asian customers.  Though some restaurants do call Goi cuon """"summer rolls"""" instead.  And I once personally saw a menu for a Thai restaurant that had both typical egg-rolls and typical spring rolls but also offered Goi cuon as well, labeling it as the """"house spring roll""""!  """,0

 Roman Catholic Fanatics taking over christian articles in wikipedia? 

There has been a very alarming trend in wikipedia of recent. An organised gang of roman catholic extremists based in several western countries are editing and manipulating almost every article related to Christianity. Many of them build up credibility stealthily, gained administratorship in wikipedia and then started working on their agenda. The renaming of the article """"Roman Catholic Church"""" as the """"Catholic Church"""" is one example. All apostolic churches consider themselves the """"one holy catholic and apostolic church"""", not just the Roman.

Cuchullian is only part of a small group in this wider trend, he has been focusing on Romanising the articles related to Syriac Christianity in particular. The article related to Nestorian christians(Church of the East), Syriac Orthodox, Saint Thomas Christians of India etc have been attacked and manipulated. Assyrian Christians who were more or less Iconoclasts and abhorred themselves from extreme forms of marian devotion, are presented in these newly edited articles as adhering to the Roman Pope. How is it possible when Roman christians were at the opposite end of the theological spectrum?

The Catholic Encyclopaedia made in 1914, is at present a more sane and less virulent form of Vaticanised history than found in wikipedia. Wikipedia is becoming more pro-vatican and filled with roman propaganda, compared to the Catholic encyclopaedia! If we do not check this trend now, wikipedia will be transformed into a battleground of religious fanatics. People like cuchullian are destroying the ethic and defeating the purpose of wikipedia.

 I Have been Trying to change my Tone  

Status comment seems to express '''the 1 and only the thing I was hoping for.
 
Thank you -

                     To Everyone Involved
 I understand that I myself have many faults and could have avoided it, if I was wiser and also headed the very wise sayings of JC -

such as  - A kind word Turns away wrath -  

But I am only human and I try to not be a hypocrite. 

I strive all ways to admit my transgressions and apologize for offence. And if asked even if I feel I am justified.

Others seamed to expect more from me - than they are willing to give themselves.
  
And really I thought mostly I was trying to teach or provide or gain explanation, not be self righteous.

But I can see others could easily perceive otherwise.
 
I Know I am ultimately To blame Because I am stubourn - I have difficulty with relating to some people and some forms of """"Authority"""" - and have spent much of my life bashing my head against brick walls. And It Hurts alot and iam sick of it.

And I am quick to anger when I feel disrespected unjustifiably.

I do not in any way attempt to justify all my statements etc as some were very malicious but I think only when I FELT forced into a corner.

            I Just wanted to clarify to you my Sincerity. 

                   Which is very very strong
 I am sorry - BUT This does not mean I that I would not again become angry? 

even to Plasmic Physics for obviously - He Knows Knot What He Does - Hopefully?
and- DMacks 
- But I also think they do have reason to be sorry also -
 
Iam sorry to DMacks for the final insults - but he did (I believe) on purpose ignore, again, his own words of advise and push that obvious button ON PURPOSE.  
          

But I still cant figure what Plasmic Physics and osperys wise council was.
  
And should see the truth in many of my sayings etc.

I also never intended any type of malicious revenge type behavior - 
Sincerely -
and any comments that may have been misunderstood Re DMacks etc? 
Were apart from the following up any confirmed malicious hacking of my computer systems.

Were in relation to Karma eg 

-Revenge is mine says the lord - etc

Even if I was to be let back in I don't think I am wanted or want to or the right type of personality.

I like looking for and correcting flaws in obvious logic/science of arguments, statements of things. mainly organic chem really and this seams to rub people up the wrong way  etc not chase up refs for every little detail

Any how I just wanted to leave you on that note.

What a waste of all our time.

""" the mother carries her kittens. It should also point out that the behaviour links to mating as well. During mating the male bites the female on the back of the neck, and it is noticeable that many cats will adopt a 'ready' posture, when not in heat or even male cats, when grasped by the scruff. 62.49.6.17  
I've added this, see Cat#Skin Think outside the box 

 Scientific classification 

It appears that the current use of F. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. I propose it is changed back to F. catus. First, this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion; most recently:
/Archive 8#Species name, and
/Archive 8#Scientific name
This discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. It was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus, but no such citations were given. The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from """"This erroneous nomenclature"""" and the preceding paragraphs. ITIS was also cited in discussion. This clearly prefers catus as the conventional name, although it cites MWS in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.

It would therefore be much more NPOV to acknowledge F. catus as the usual name. If catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under #Scientific classification. Currently, this section should have {{disputed-section|Scientific classification}} put on it, because its interpretation of the source is wrong. I would do this, but I'm a new user, so semi-protection is stopping me. It would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence; all the most cited, most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured F. catus.

Also, while this is still semi-protected, I'd like to point out that both inline citations of Mammal Species of the World should be removed. The first is uncalled for by WP:LEAD#Citations. The name """"cat"""" is common knowledge and is recognised by all 62 other references in the article body. The second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. MSW doesn't even mention these names, so it's unfair to synthesise from that that Wozencraft, let alone all feline biologists, does not support them. However, MSW is a useful reference, so I suggest moving the citation to external links, or a probably-needed """"Further reading"""" section.   
Works for me. My opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and F. catus is now the accepted name, then so be it. ''''  {chat} 
MSW3 is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. It uses Felis catus and notes there is some controversy. We should do the same. -  (talk) 
I view this with suspicion. If 's interpretation is true, then ITIS should not report the domestic dog as Canis lupus familiaris, and call Canis familiaris invalid. The ITIS webpage has no entry at all for Felis silvestris catus, not even to call it invalid. Felis silvestris catus is used more and more frequently in the scientific literature. I draw this from scholar.google.com: 
From 1982-1991, 0 uses of Felis silvestris catus, many uses of Felis silvestris f catus'' whatever that notation means.
From 1992-2000, [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&num;=100&btnG;=Search+Schol",0

"C (New York City Subway service) 

Stop adding so much unnecessary edits to the C train article. I don't know why you're going into more detail about the R32s. It's just a damn train. Nobody cares how often a train breaks down or whatever issues it has. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a Mean Distance Between Failures figure about how often any train break downs or whatever. Besides, the C train and the R32 car articles already mentions the breakdown rates anyway, just in a more subtle way. All it matters is just simply saying that the R32s were moved to outdoor lines to save their aging air compressors from having to work underground all the time. That's it. There's no need to mention what kind of issues the cars themselves have nor how they are/were solved. At least, in my book, your edits to the C train article were either completely over-opinionated, unsourced, or both, and thus, are not needed to mention. It's not like you work for the MTA anyway, so don't speculate about railcar maintenance, inspection or issues. If you don't work for the MTA and therefore, have no experience about the inner workings within the transit agency itself at all, by all means, stay silent, sit back, and relax.",0

From where I sit however, when he went straight to his old battleground, you welcomed him back in kind - and the fact is on Wiki experienced users are expected to do better than that. Some sort of attempt at peacemaking is best, or some sort of dialogue or somesuch. When you ran straight to an admin and then AN/I to get the topicban reinstated, it showed me that you are not interested (probably because you believe it is impossible) in working together with Vintagekits - and possibly others who share his viewpoint. You see it as more Vintagekits' fault, but from my chair, you're both beyond the cutoff. Please remember, my job is to not create parity, equity, equality, or even justice, though I flatter myself and think I can produce it in my own life on occasion. No, I am an administrator not a philosopher-king, and at the end of the day Wikipedia needs no one, not you, Vintagekits, or I, more than it needs a productive working environment as a whole.

When I was involved with Vintagekits' topic ban, at the previous round with the Baronets and troubles bans, I can tell you that they worked to great effect, maintaining him in a topic of interest - despite his protestations of injustice.

Historical-critical biblical theologians have no automatic nor exclusive claim to authority in this matter. Neutrality in this instance is clear. The article must provide context to the reader about the question, show the various positions and approaches taken in different fields, and ensure that no single claim to exclusive authority or evocation of essentially meaningless and conflictual universal generalisations is present. It can not possibly be any clearer. The article is fundamentally flawed in two ways 1)claims to exclusive authority and 2) circular and self-referential evidentiary support.

 Paul Siebert 

This guy's just like a Holocaust denier in the way he masks his revisionism in casual and practical editing.  He recently removed the section by Sascha and commented that it was poorly sourced despite the fact that two of the sources are easily availible online, and another is from a book, which can also be found on Google Books if the page or quote is entered.  He's clearly grasping at straws.

Would anyone have any objections to sending out a mass text to undo his revisionism when he goes on one of his rampages?

  
He was correct. """"Poorly sourced"""" means that the added text was not supported by any sources mentioned in the article. If you want to add something with proper references, go right ahead. And in the future, please refrain from accusing a good editor of something as serious as """"Holocaust denier"""" when you know for a fact this is not true. I highly suggest not attempting some kind of attack on the article either. |  | talk | 

I was the original writer of the section.  I also received the same briefing on Paul Siebert from Alex before registering here.  First, the sources were mentioned in the article, if you're referring to the ones about Neo-Nazi historical revisionism, as I was talking about what Neo-Nazis say, and their revisionism.  Second, Paul Siebert, assuming what Alex told me is true, is a Holocaust denier, as he denied acts of genocide committed against Holocaust victims at the end of the war.  This can be confirmed in Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State and The Fall of Berlin 1945, both of which have been cited here by Alex.

Apparantley I have made a mistake called WP:OUTING in regards to sockpuppet user 86.40.192.203 whom had begun a discussion on the admin board against me with false charges. this sockpuppet had done this previously saying he was not a sock - yet again he oppened a second admin section against me with a new sock saying that he was someone different yet he was clearly the same guy (lying and saying he was a new editor)

i say in no uncertain terms that i had never heard of WP:OUTING and am sorry if i have violated this policy - but i should also say that all the information i posted i got from his own prior vandalism - essentially he outed himself - he vandalized a page to give his name and date of birth - which got reverted by another editor because it had nothing to do with the article he was vandalizing - his location i got from the wiki's own traceroute function that i thought we were allowed to use to prove sockpuppetrty68.231.15.56  

in one of his sockpuppet attacks here Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#User talk:68.231.15.56 he states that """"This person has only recently been reported."""" this sentence implies that SOMEONEELSE reported me and yet the IP of the previous reporter is 86.40.107.69 which traces to the same location in Ireland - this is by definition sockpuppetry or the use of various IP's to do malicious intent without acknowledement of ownership68.231.15.56

Well here are the three match reports from PTFC corresponding with the date where he supposedly played ,  &  as you can see on all three occasions it was in fact Aaron Sinclair. I contacted Soccerway about this a few months back hence they have his stats as zero see here & I also got them to correct Aaron Sinclair's. Given the article doesn't seem to pass WP:GNG you want to consider userfying it. Regards ★☆ ☆★ 13:39, 10",0

 That is fine that you have set out your views. I have set out mine and when I am accused to talking 'nonsense' for expressing those views I will respond likewise. That you decide you do not like my reaction does not give you or those of your frame of mind the right to starve my views of the oxygen of publicity, as one nice Englishwoman put it in 1988. I do not have to accept any British nomenclature for my home. I live in Ireland; I therefore am Irish. I live in Europe; I therefore am a European. To claim that I live in what British people have termed the """"British Isles"""" is, despite the wire-balancing act by some wikipedia editors, ultimately an explicit claim that I am British. That, son, is a profoundly political claim. It is hostile, aggressive and completely about imposing a British nationalist identity upon me, my family and everybody I know. It doesn't get any more political. Anybody who partakes in that British nationalist project is of that 'national disposition'. They are aligning themselves with that agenda for who I am. You cannot censor this view simply because it doesn't accord with your British Comics outlook on the world. While you were reading British Comics I was reading books like Edward Said's Orientalism (book) and Declan Kiberd's Inventing Ireland (book), both of which are books that emphasise the importance to colonial powers of controlling the representation of countries they have conquered. Claiming Ireland to be in this """"British Isles"""" is precisely about that, about controlling Irish identity, Irish direction. It is disingenuous in the extreme to claim this title is merely geographic: it is merely political! 86.42.90.145  """,0

 Authorship 

Over at the Barack Obama article, there was some discussion of whether his book authorship merited lead position.  I argued (and consensus seems agreed on this), that very brief mention of those best-sellers should be in the lead, particularly since the books have their own article section.

In McCain's case, he is co-author on several books (none seem as prominent in sales-ranking and the like), and there is not a separate section on them.  However, I still wonder whether there's any sentiment that authorship should still get a clause in the lead. ×talk """,0

"""== Norge Genocide ==

Preliminary investigation by a private agency does not rule out the possibility of the State's involvement, however ludicrous that may seem. 

While it is hard to provide any direct evidence of such a connexion, it is obvious that the killer's psychology and motivation were in some way aided by external agents, who may have been funded by Public moneys.

The above conclusion is based on -

1. Extensive tracking of ABB by State agencies prior to the attack 

2. Facilitating the procurement of arms and explosives.

3. Behavior of ABB during the attack, hints at Immunity, not Rage or Hate.

4. Social exclusion and brainwashing by agents close to ABB - denial of any employment, or opportunity, or correction, or sanitation of ABB in spite of previous crimes.
It is a well known fact that Agents in Norge subscribe to """"Voice Transmission"""" - implanting ideas in other minds like a radio.

5. An Almost Impossible explanation for the Genocide - Islamophobia - killing natives (children) has nothing to do with it, unless it is a Fear Tactic with supposedly greater meaning.

This does indicate an extremely feudal and ancient societal structure prevalent in Norge.

The Agency is completely confident of the above claims and will back it to death.

The investigation shall continue.

 Citation quality 

First thing, I kiss the (virtual) feet of Wikidemon.  Thanks so very much for the wonderful cleanup of references yesterday!

Second thing, it seems like despite the heroic efforts, citations keep getting new problems with new edits.  WB74 inserted a bunch of footnotes to support the claim that 22 charges or convictions of ACORN workers have occurred.  Unfortunately, these facts seem firstly motivated by WP:TRUTH, and only secondarily by citations.  Nonetheless, I think something close to this number is probably right, and I have nothing against it being in the article (FWIW, it was me who edited a few days ago to say """"at least 15""""... I actually think the 'at least' is clarifying, but I'm not going to fight about those two words).

At some length on this talk page, WB74 provided lots of citations, most of them from far-right opinion publications rather than reliable sources.  In an edit today to the article, a somewhat different set of citations were provided.  These seem rather sloppily collected.  The first one I looked at was the wonderfully WP:RS NYT; however, once I read its body, I saw that it had nothing relevant to the 22 claim given in the sentence (it was about Ken Blackwell's stricter enforcement of registration requirements in 2006, perhaps in excess of the new laws according to the article).  It was an interesting article, just not one having anything to do with the sentence it was listed next to.

So I'll look through the rest of the added citations.  I urge other editors to also pay careful attention to the relevance and accuracy of citations added by a certain set of highly partisan editors.  There's wheat among the chaff, but we obviously can't assume that just because something points to, e.g. NYT it actually supports the point claimed. ×talk """,0

Agree forums of this nature are not reliable sources, and content lacking a reliable source should be removed.   

Adoniscik I am the right source to provide this information because I am talking from experience.  I had first written an angry letter to Cyprus Today in order to complain about some of our professors resigning due to the economic problems in 2005. It was published along with two responses which completely overwhelmed me with such claims that TRNC diplomas are 'worthless pieces of paper' and one other going so far as to say that EMU is a 'zoo'. I then wrote a second letter to defend the university because I felt my intentions were taken advantage of. I wanted to complain not trash the university. The following summer I had some work expierence which was not too bad but I still felt a bit uncomfortable about this newspapers stand to North Cyprus higher education. I did an interview with the Rector at the time Prof. Dr. Halil Guven which was not published. The next summer I translated positive artices from the Press office at EMU for 2-3 months and again they were not published. To be honest I have not been following what they have been writing since then, but as soon as I read that this article was written at Cyprus Today I am now certain that this newspaper has a negative stand point on TRNC higher education therefore, I do not think they are a reliable source on these matters. They cannot present the story in an objective manner.
As for the Israeli employees at EMU I can only provide again from first ahnd experience as one of his students that it was not anything to do with his nationality but honestly I don't think we were getting anything out of his classes. He just was not doing his job and at times making strange comments in his classes that were irritating students to the point that they would complain and sign a petition.   —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

 Dear DCstats and ERosa 

Starting a new section here because the preceding is hopelessly indented.

DCstats and ERosa, you are mistaken in your thinking. Jdannan and Avenue are quite correct. I know this might be very difficult for you to accept. You claim to have references supporting your interpretation. However, I think you are misinterpreting the statements from the textbooks you are reading. I can't speak for your """"petroleum industry statistican"""" friend. My guess is that you conveyed your misinterpretation of the situation to him/her. I have a ph.d. in mathematics and after reading this talk page and thinking I was almost losing my mind, I consulted with several other ph.d. mathematician and statistician friends of mine who confirmed that Jdannan and Avenue are indeed correct. And the interpretation given in the article is basically correct as well. In fact, it's the interpretation I've seen given in every stats book I've looked at.

Some references, since these seem to be very important to people:

""""Warning! There is much confusion about how to interpret a confidence interval. A confidence interval is not a probability statement about θ since θ is a fixed quantity, not a random variable."""" — Larry Wasserman, All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, p. 92
""""CAUTION! A 95% confidence interval does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains μ. Remember, probability describes the likelihood of undetermined events. Therefore, it does not make sense to talk about the probability that the interval contains μ, since the population mean is a fixed value. Think of it this way: Suppose I flip a coin and obtain a head. If I ask you to determine the probability that the flip resulted in a head, it would not be 0.5, because the outcome has already been determined. Instead the probability is 0 or 1. Confidence intervals work the same way. Because μ is already determined, we do not say that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains μ."""" — Michael Sullivan III, Statistics: Informed Decisions Using Data, p. 453
""""The idea of interval estimation is complicated; an example is in order. Suppose that, for each λ, x is a real random variable normally distributed about λ with unit variance; then, as is very easy to see with the aid of a table of the normal distribution, if M(x) is taken to be the interval [x − 1.9600, x + 1.9600], then (1) P(λ in M(x) | λ) = α, where α is constant and almost equal to 0.95. It is usually thought necessary to warn the novice that such an equation as (1) does not concern the probability that a random variable λ lies in a fixed set M(x). Of course, λ is given and therefore not random in the context at hand; and given λ, α is the probability that M(x), which is a contraction of x, has as its value an interval that contains λ."""" — Leonard J. Savage, The Foundations of Statistics, p. 260

Your misunderstanding seems to be based on an inadequate grasp of a few facts:

 The population mean μ is a fixed constant, not a random variable.
 The endpoints of the confidence interval are random variables, not fixed constants.
 A statement about the level of confidence of a confidence interval is a probabilistic statement about the endpoints of the interval considered as random variables.

The issue about whether μ is """"known"""" or not is a complete red herring. What matters is that μ is fixed, not whether it's """"known"""". This also has absolutely nothing to do with probabilistic interpretations of quantum physics, good lord.

Let me go through an example which has the most simplifying assumptions. Suppose we have a normally distributed random variable X  on a population with mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ = 16, and suppose we select samples of size n = 100. Then the sample mean X-bar is a sampling distribution defined on the space of all possible samples of size 100, and it has mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ/sqrt(n) = 16/sqrt(100) = 16/10 = 1.6. A 95% confidence interval for μ based on this sampling is then given by (X-bar − zα/2*σ/sqrt(n), X-bar + zα/2*σ/sqrt(n)) = (X-bar − (1.96)*1.6, X-bar + (1.96)*1.6) = (X-bar − 3.136, X-bar + 3.136).

Now, note the following facts:

 The confidence interval is defined to be a random interval, i.e. the endpoints of the confidence interval are random variables defined in terms of the sample mean X-bar.

"""

 a few suggestions on """"Measuring economic worth over time"""" 

I fully realize that this is a work in progress but thought a few suggestions could be useful. I'll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:

 Please don't take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid """"academic phrasing"""" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example """"social cost"""" or """"social production"""".
 Speaking of """"social production"""" it'd be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by """"proportions of social production"""" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you're equivocating between """"economic worth"""" and """"social worth"""" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I'm probably coming at this from a different background I'm wondering what exactly is the relationship between """"social product"""" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.
 """"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people."""" - I'm not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really """"inherently"""" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn't seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don't think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern """"working class people"""". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of """"economic worth"""" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.
 Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren't really related. For example the question """"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?"""" is not obviously or directly related to the question """"what was the social power of capital in 1840?"""".
 Some ideas for expansion: """"Theoretical problems"""" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). """"Wage price series"""" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I'm not sure what a """"real price"""" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there's also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There's also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don't really constitute a series but do provide """"snapshot"""" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.

I'd really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so I thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better. Thanks.  """,0

 """"Jesus and Messianic prophecy"""" 

Hey. I don't know if this is technically where I should be posting this; sorry if it's not.

1) Fine, if """"retort"""" isn't 100% appropriate then I'll use """"counter-argue""""- that is the meaning I was trying to get across.

But I think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with Wikipedia's guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general.

2) You said: """"Christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a time-line for the Messiah's actions, and the New Testament, especially the Book of Revelation, detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later. . This is a bit vague and raises some questions. Which Christians? Where did they say that? How did they detail it? Can you reference it from a notable/semi-notable scholar?""""

First, I can't point to a place in the Old Testament where the time-line DOESN'T exist, you know what I mean? There is no Jewish time-line so it cannot be referenced. But the New Testament does have a Christian time-line, as detailed in the Book of Revelation. Now, which Christians hold to this belief? Essentially all of them- all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the Bible, which is essentially all. Where did Christian authors detail this belief? In the Bible! How did they detail it? They wrote it in the Bible!!! That is why I made Bible references! Which scholar can I quote? How about John the Apostle, who wrote Revelation? Is one of the founders of Christianity an acceptable source on the subject?

I find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing, """"Christians believe Jesus came back from the dead, as detailed in various places, including the gospels,"""" and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting Bible passages and asking, """"which Christians believe that?"""". 

3) You said: This includes Jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse (Revelation 19-22). , although it does reference The Bible, if left alone, it sounds rather confusing. It also does not specifically reference a line from Revelation, nor does it reference which version of The Bible it quotes (King James, NIV, etc) which could mean a slight difference in the quote. 

If you want many specific Bible quotes then I'll put those in, and I'll list if its KJV or whatever. But I don't think that's required as my broad citation of Rev 19-22 does clearly explain exactly what I'm talking about, including a physical kingdom on earth, a messianic age of righteousness and so on. Just because I didn't dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesn't mean they aren't there- any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters.

If I had written, """"The story of Noah's Ark is in Genesis 6-9,"""" would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague? Just because I didn't give a synopsis with ten references doesn't mean it's unworthy; just look it up! 

4) What bothers me most is how this whole thing started when I tried to correct incorrect data on your site (the line that Christians don't believe in a physical resurrection). That line had NO references! So even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post, don't they? You can't delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all.

5) I'm sure you'll disagree with me on this one, but most of all, I think that my contribution didn't need to cite ANYTHING as it is such common knowledge that Christians believe in Judgment Day, an age of peace etc. I feel like I'm in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief. 

It's almost as bad as someone posting, """"Christians don't believe Jesus was tried, executed and came back to life,"""" then I post that they do, citing Luke 20-24, then you saying that it is too vague etc. It was pure courtesy to give the citation- it's such common knowledge that Christians believe these things!

But whatever- I'll repost with a several more-specific quotes. And BTW, you may think, """"Whoa, this guy care WAY too much about Wikipedia (and I'm a mod),"""" but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented. (And I hate inconsistency.)

Re the above

Regarding your edit . I fail to see how I am responsible for personal attacks when clearly the other editor has been making defamatory statements about my expertise in support of misinformation he has linked to on wikipedia. I consider it a thoroughly proven fact that the page http://www.tenstringguitar.com/tuningsforthe10string.html contains misinformation. No one can honestly claim that """"four"""" is the same as """"eight"""". Though after repeated warnings about the content of this page, Andrewa continued to reference this page and to defend it by claiming that saying """"four"""" is the same as saying """"eight"""" and that this is a non-issue. How convenient. I think your conduct in this matter is unfair (and you've evidently not looked thoroughly into the contents) as I am clearly the one who is defending verifiable facts as stated in music journals by the inventor of the modern 10-string guitar (my teacher's teacher), whereas Andrewa is falsely accusing me of attacking him (where is the evidence? on what grounds?) because I point out that he repeatedly, knowingly links to and defends misinformation.

If there is a case for personal attack, if you can PROVE that Andrewa did not link to false information (this is a contents issue), then do so. Otherwise, please stop making false accusations against me.

""""Alternatively, a saver could entrust their money with a bank for investment in the full-reserve equivalent of time deposits or savings accounts, which in a full reserve system would represent loans made to the bank rather than deposits.[1]""""

A deposit in a bank is by definition a loan to the bank, even though most people do not realise they are investors in a banks profit making operations.

Also the article is getting mixed up by the true nature of a fractional reserve bank.   A fractional reserve bank does not have sufficient on hand liquid assets to enable customers who have lent money to the bank to be paid out in a timely manner unless a buyer can be found for the illiquid loan book or loans can be secured against the loan book.

The bank of amsterdam was a warehouse bank.  You paid money to have your money stored at the bank.
the warehouse bank that lends customers savings money on term deposit still has the same problems if the loans go bad because it is in fact operating with fractional reserve.  The loans mean either deposits are created at the same bank or term savers money is no longer at the bank.  Either way you get two claims on the same money.  1. by the saver and 2 by the money user.

If the bank fails then somebody ends up with less money.

"""
First, I would observe that there was a nearly unanimous consensus in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winzapper to retain the article.  Every established user who commented at the AFD besides you supported retention of the article.  Under such circumstances, the AFD discussion would almost certainly have been closed as """"keep"""" regardless of who closed it. I doubt that there would be many administrators willing to delete an article as a result of an AFD discussion in which many established users supported retention of the article, and not one established user besides the nominator supported deletion, unless the article constituted a serious WP:BLP violation, a copyright violation, or was otherwise exceptionally harmful, or there was clear evidence that comments favoring retention were the result of canvassing, abusive sockpuppetry, or other unacceptable activity.  Why?  Simply put, the strengths of arguments offered at AFD discussions do not exist as absolute quantities which are not subject to any reasonable dispute.  Instead, the perceived strength of arguments varies as a function of the person evaluating them.  So, an administrator who decided to delete an article in the face of essentially unanimous support of established users for retaining it would be putting himself in the position of claiming that his personal judgment regarding the merits of the arguments presented was so far superior to the judgment of every other established user who expressed an opinion at the AFD that his personal opinion properly outweighed nearly all others.  An administrator might properly advance such a claim only in rather exceptional circumstances, which were not present here.  This is not to say, however, that AFD discussions are decided purely by counting the votes of established users: they clearly are not.  Rather, the applicability of the principle that AFD is not a vote is subject to limitations, which are most clearly reached when there is absolutely no support by anyone except the nominator for the deletion of an article.  Administrators have been known, on occasion, to delete articles as a result of AFD discussions in which a clear majority of established users supported retention of the article, if they personally believe the arguments for deletion to be more firmly supported by Wikipedia policy or otherwise more persuasive; even in such cases, however, they generally require some substantial support for the deletion of an article before deleting it (though the supporters of deletion may be distinctly in the minority).

As a corollary to the principle that administrators quite rarely delete articles against a nearly unanimous consensus for retention at AFD, it is quite rarely the case that there would be a nearly unanimous consensus for the retention of an article that was in clear violation of Wikipedia policy or otherwise clearly needed to be deleted.  While it is true that Wikipedia's verifiability and notability policies require that articles concern topics of which there is significant coverage in multiple third-party reliable sources, and while the presence of such sources in the article itself at the time of the AFD provides the clearest possible evidence of notability, there is no support, in either Wikipedia policy or practice, for the contention that any article which comes to AFD without the necessary sources to establish its notability, and to which no such sources are added during the AFD discussion, must therefore automatically be deleted.  Rather, where it is reasonably believed that the sources necessary to establish notability are likely to exist, the  community may choose to retain the article, even if such sources are not present at the time of the AFD.  So, if someone were to nominate, say, our article on the National Electrical Code for deletion on the grounds of inadequate sourcing and failure to establish notability, the article would properly be retained, even if sufficient sources weren't produced during the AFD discussion.  Often, the belief that acceptable sources can be found for an article is little more than subjective opinion.  Consequently, arguments of the form """"keep, I believe this subject is notable"""" are valid at AFD, if a sufficient number of established users assert them.  """,0

"Chart order 

At the moment the budgets are charted off the IMDB amounts.  It seems silly to arbitrarily select a source for the chart order, expecially when there are concerns noted above over the site being a reliable source.  As you can see I've been working through the films adding reliable sources from places like The New York Times, Variety etc, so there is now better sourced information to rank the films from.  

Given the nature of budget estimates, they often differ from source to source and that has to be taken into account.  I'm against arbitrarily 'picking' a source to rank by.  I am also against the idea of averaging the amounts given by the sources or picking the most frequently cited amount, since this system would be open to manipulation by adding more sources.  My solution would be to rank using the lowest common denominator; case in point:  some sources say GI Joe cost $170m, and some $175m, but while the figures don't match they both agree that the film cost at least $170m.  In view of that, my suggestion would be to rank off the lower amount, but include the higher amount as an alternative estimate.  In the case of films where we have an official figure I'm of the opinion that the films should always be ranked by the official budget with any further estimates included as an alternative estimate.

I'll hopefully finish sourcing the remaining films on the chart over the next week and will then implement the new chart structure if no-one has any objections.",0

With all due respect it is very hard to find evidence of words depicting his playing style whereas the passage I have written clearly shows Messi's ability as any other person with football knowledge would agree. I don't think that there is any evidence apart from video evidence to confirm what I wrote about Messi.
For example passages such as 'he has exceptional dribbling ability, fantastic technique, he likes to cut inside onto his stronger left foot' are clear, direct observations of Messi's playing style for some years. This is confusing for me as of why you had deleted my post as some other users send me a message saying how that it was very helpful and detailed. Also, concerning the evidence problem, would you please kindly replace the passage I wrote because it is not a biased passage and clearly reflects Messi's playing style, I have also used what other commentators have frequently said and if you have ever watched a match with Messi weaving his magic you will know and surely agree along with the millions who watch him that this is a very descriptive, accurate passage about his playing style.
I am very hurt by your edit and deletion and I would ask you to kindly replace this text as it took me a very long time to write. If not, please tell me why or let me speak to someone else who could advise me or who would think I am justified
Thank you",0

yeah, so is there like some huge behind the scenes society that edits and checks every single thing on wikipedia? you people talk of writing articles as if its your job.

I think this is just a bit silly that you can't see your own biases. Why can't you see your own biases? Or had you considered the fact a good majority of Wikipedia editors share a Left of center POV by Jimmy Wales' own admission? The bias is hardly in a conservative direction, or even neutral. How can you say there isn't a decided hostility to conservative or traditional points of view on Wikipedia
Wikipedia's NPOV rule is meaningless, considering this fact. Explain to me why you think my observation of fact is absurd? Wikipedia isn't a reliable source because this fact, and if you hadn't been reading students in colleges in America, at least, are discouraged from citing it because of serious factual errors and political biases that pass for the truth. 
The problem here IS NOT with me.  
Guy, I wish you could see how the world views Wikipedia, and it's not good. Wikipedia's NPOV rule is symbolic, and from what I have seen no one here follows it. I have read all of the rules,and I have made every effort to follow them. Do everyone a favor and declare that Wikipedia is a Left-wing site. e.g.,  a blog. It comes down to an ideosyncratic application of the rules to fit your worldviews.
FM writes for the Democratic Underground, Jim68sch has confessed to having Marxist sentiments and you have confessed to being sympathetic to homosexuality. So, how can you say that there isn't a Left of center bias on Wikipedia?  I am mentioning the fact I Googled FM's handle, and found posts under his handle on the decidedly Liberal/Socialist Democratic Underground because it shows where his political biases lay.
How then can he be anymore objective than I?
FM said I weakened his viewpoint that Dominionism was a threat or a problem by adding the viewpoints of self-professed Christian Reconstructionists to the Dominionism article. How can you say that he's neutral anymore than I am neutral. My beef with that particular article is that it seems to stereotype all conservative American Christians as wanting to replace the U.S. Constitution with a neo-Puritan theocracy. 
Wikipedia lacks the same quality as Encyclopedia Britannica when it comes to maintaining a non-partisan perspective?
I consider myself knowledgeable about the Christian right, at least the Catholic faction therof, and I object to what I see as the blatant stereotyping of conservative Christians. The fact Chip Berlet or Katherine Yurica are considered """"experts"""" furthers my perception of bias. Mr. Berlet, I will concede, is more factual than say Ms. Yurica, but he paints with a very broad brush that ignores the diversity of the Christian right.
Their writings are riddled with strawman attacks, guilt by association, glaring generalizations, etc. The series of articles on """"Dominionism"""" are riddled with factual errors and POV. Is it NPOV to limit the content to a single POV where only those who share a single POV are granted """"expert"""" status?
I will leave Wikipedia alone for awhile, and perhaps limit myself to editing on the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox-oriented pages. When it comes to politics, Wikipedia is of limited informative value.

 b) the roots or context of the phenomenon, e.g. women in the slave caste of Korea, the system of local agents in Asia buying and selling daughters (it equally existed in Japan as well).
 c) its legacy afterwards in the industrialization of the Korean sex industry after WWII, e.g. the same comfort women working in prostitution for the American occupational forces and the Korean army. To state the obvious, the women and system did not just disappear post-WWII.

Subsequently Eleland came along and deleted most of your modifications claiming that they were not from authoritative enough sources and that they were disproportionate within the article. Eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when I reinstated the article. Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin's response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations. 

Admittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland's herculean efforts to include material about Israel on the Caterpillar.Inc issue. Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under """"Ed O'Loughlin"""" but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself. 

This is perhaps strange considering, and I quote:  Editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument. Wikipedia must include all notable points of view which appear in verifiable published sources. Reporting that activists have said something does not imply that the activists are correct. Removing those reports because you think the activists aren't correct contradicts Wikipedia's core policies. Eleland

 Harry Potter is a Girl 

Dear Jimbo, I posted something here and it was archived because it was viewed that after a 3 day ban I was too expert in the use of WP:XXXX rules to be a newbie. It was said """"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives."""" I don't even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn't know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn't even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it. 86.93.139.223  

So you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them. So while it might be hard for you to believe that someone can read in 3 days a bunch of WP:XXXX rules, it is not impossible. Actually I didn't have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don't bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don't understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn't that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can't read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments. Sorry but this is exactly the reason I contacted Jimbo and not you. Maximus. 86.93.139.223 (talk)  86.93.139.223  

Dear Jimbo, This is a part of a longer post on the Alkaline Diet page called Harry Potter is a Girl. As I am a newbie I don't know how to do links so copied it here. Sorry for taking your space up on your talk page. Also sorry for WP:TLDR. Please delete this if it is of no interest to you. I can't know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next. I have put it here as I wanted you to know of my experience here at Wikipedia and how after a few days due to repeated WP:BITE I am leaving Wikipedia editing never to return. Because the people between you and me are the problem I thought to go straight to the top. Sometimes the people at the top don't get told what is going on below them. Anyway thanks for Wikipedia. Good luck and perhaps reduce the number of rules / guidelines as I think they are being manipulated and misused.

Excuse me, many previous editors, including FA reviewers, thought there had not been enough biographical info.

"I have never read Albert Wass, I have only heard that he was a biased writer. It does not neccessary mean that, he wrote simply untruth. I am sure there are documents about nasty happenings on the other side as well. Such a conflict between two nations surely cause atrocities in both side.

The challenge here, is how to write a neutral article! Therefore mutual actknowledgement of atrocities would be just enough. I would fear to go into details, it would just provoke sentiments.",0

 Pessimism v. optimism in Beckett. 

I have an issue with the statment """"Beckett's work is . . . deeply pessimistic about the human condition"""" as found in the first paragraph. I changed """"deeply"""" to """"deceptively,"""" and it was immediately changed back. I don't know how to contact the subsequent editor directly, so I'll post this here by way of discussion.

Perhaps replacing “deeply” with “deceptively” is not the best fix, but as it stands the quoted statement puts forth, as fact, an opinion that is widley open to interpretation.

Beckett’s writings aren’t just about the journey. If they were, “deeply pessimistic” would be nearly undebatable. They’re just as much about the destination, or at least the goal. And while he frames life’s journey as a slog through shit, his ultimate implication is that the slog is worthwhile. As everything from the Greek and Latin classics to the greatest of Hollywood’s pro-war propaganda movies have proven again and again, the more monstrously you portray the obstacle, the larger looms the hero who overcomes them. The same is true in Beckett: the obstacles are unrelenting and nearly insurmountable, but the journey continues, heroically. The Beckett hero may be standing in the dark, but he's faced towards the light, distant—an unattainable—as it may be.

The essential Beckett quote isn’t “I can’t go on”—full stop; it’s “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”

Now, I may not have convinced you, personally, that Beckett’s work is more optimistic than pessimistic. But perhaps I’ve made a case that a flatly factual statement like “Beckett's work is stark . . . and deeply pessimistic about the human condition” is a bit overstated for an article that strives to remain free of bias. 

Beckett himself would be the first to disagree with you. He once said that if he were a pessimist, he wouldn’t write.  Although I know that the artist is not always the most reliable source for understanding his work, that ought to count for something.""",0

 Why compare only to Windows 2000 features? 

As this issue has clearly caused quite a bit of confusion, I've decided to address it here. Windows XP is in the unique position - compared to all other Windows releases I can think of - of being at the convergence point of two separate Windows product lines, that of Windows NT and the old, MS-DOS-based Windows 9x. However, the core code in XP is based on the former and not the latter (hence XP has an internal version number of 5.1, while Windows 2000 has one of 5.0 - among numerous other things). A list of every single feature included in Windows ME (the last of the MS-DOS based versions) but not in XP would be quite long indeed, and also quite pointless, because it would be comparing operating systems of two very different architectures. (There's also the fact that comparisons between the other """"List of features removed in Windows"""" articles and this one would actually be made far more difficult.)   """,0

To repeat what I'd already said at ANI, I am not alleging a topic ban breach, except perhaps under the """"broadly construed"""" wording. I am stating that, based on the manner of this series of reverts on The Automobile Association , followed by this 'rewrite', and based on the fact that HighKing has yet to make any associated comment at Talk:The Automobile Association, instead choosing to treat this as an issue of """"vandalism"""", HighKing has inarguably ignored the warnings Cailil gave him when he re-enacted the BI topic ban about his future conduct. Those can still be seen on his own talk page under the """"Removals of the term British Isles (again)"""" section on HighKing's talk page, so he has no excuse for not remembering them. You're going to have to read that whole thread to get the picture, but it shows quite clearly that Cailil was quite explicit in what he expected from HighKing going forward, in addition to simply adhering to the topic ban: he must stop edit warring and start discussing, he must stop this behaviour of policing terminology on Wikipedia, he must stop introducing (and maintaining by reverts) innacuracies (his altered version of the quote is not in the source, so is clearly innacurate). Basically, he was telling him to just go and find something completely different to do than this, because it is of no benefit to the project. What he has done instead, is just transfer his focus from policing usage of the term 'British Isles' on Wikipeda, to policing the term 'Republic of Ireland', while mainaining the same bad behaviours - edit warring, lack of discussion, misrepresentation of sources, misuse of guidelines/policy, etc, etc. As an administrator, the onus is on you to step in and stop it. Five years is long enough to be still getting away with this sort of WP:TE in the way you have so far allowed him to in this case. You need to block HighKing now until he gives cast iron assurances he understands why Cailil wrote those things on his talk page, and tells you precisely how he proposes to avoid it in future. That's it. As far as evidence goes, short of me pulling out direct quotes of what Cailil said to HighKing, I don't see what more you need to see, to do what is required of you.   """,0

 Silent Consensus About Reality 

This phrase stopped me dead in my tracks:

...silent consensus about reality.

Perhaps the phrase """"silent consensus about reality"""" has a clear meaning in the jargon of some school of thought, but I have never encountered it before and have no idea what it refers to.  I'd like to see this re-written or expanded so that it's comprehensible by the average person (or removed altogether).  Since I have no idea what it means I'm not able to re-write or expand it, and I'm loathe to just delete it since it has survived many other edits and therefore presumably means something to others.  

The phrase was added by Special:Contributions/85.127.205.253 85.127.205.253 at 2009-01-31T03:27:25.  Can that person clarify what they intended to say?  Can anyone else offer an explanation?

Status, let me ask you somethingwhere do you think these budget quotes you put up as gospel come from?  They come from people at these websites evaluating the information available to them.  Nobody ever calls them from the studio and says """"Okay, here's what we spent on this movie.""""  They do not like that information to be widely available.  In their perfect world, nobody would know what they spent on their moviesthey'd announce a preliminary figure before one frame of film was shot, and no matter how much higher the actual expenses went, that's what people would quote.  But we're curious to know, and it's part of how we decide how well (or poorly) a given film did, so in the very rare event that somebody directly at the center of financing a given film says """"Budget was Mid-30's"""", that's actually a big deal to a site like box office mojo.  They take that very seriously, and they will use that to base a budget estimate onknowing full well that's not the exact figure, and neither they nor any other website will ever have the exact figure.  No movie ever costs exactly 10 million, 20 million, 100 million, etc.  It's always approximate.  It's never exact.  And it's usually lowballed, because studios want people to think they made more money than they really did (or in this case, that they lost less money than they really did).  Now you can see I haven't edited the budget info for this movie in days, so what exactly is your problem here?  You know, if I'd just emailed bomojo on the quiet, it would say 35mil on this article right now.  But I was honest and aboveboard, and this is the thanks I getbeing treated as if I got away with something.  And you're insulting box office mojo into the bargain.  What makes you think they're that easy to fool?  They had access to all the same sources Arre used, and they didn't think they were persuasivethey were persuaded by the article I sent them.  And honestly, I'd rather have that info there than here.  But it should be here as well.  I won't take it on myself to put it upfor now.  But you should think carefully about how this looks.

"list of surgeons 
 Recently, the list of surgeons has been removed by  without discussion or note in these talk pages, with the claim that it is promotional. I disagree with the characterization of the physician list. I do not believe it promotes any given surgeon when all the major such surgeons are listed. In this context I do not believe this list is at all promotional. Those surgeons hardly need promotion, when their waiting lists are already six months or more deep. I also believe it is important to list these people so that nobody ever gets the misimpression that such surgery is performed primarily by anyone other than reputable, accredited plastic surgeons who are members of the ASPS and other relevant organizations. In this specific case, I also believe that it is important to humanize the existence of this surgery with the names of its actual practitioners. Let us not disappear the FFS surgeons to an anonymous status, when the work they do is so vitally important to its recipients. Removal of the surgeon list also decreases the verifiability of this article's contents. (That is another matter which should be addressed - this article needs some reference citations at its end.)

Philosophy of education
I was surprised that you did not propose to move Constructivism (philosophy of education) to Constructivist epistemology. Why discriminate against Constructivism when you feel so strongly about Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Humanism?  

Constructivism seems to be more consciously employed within the philosophy of education. I prefer to err on the side of leaving material if there might be a basis for doing so. (In addition, there is an extant article on this with considerable substance.)
There are many schools which strive to provide a humanistic education, and an article could be written about this if there are sufficient sources. This would probably be a little different than an article on humanism as a philosophy of education. Why (I ask rhetorically)? Isn't it less a coherent philosophy of education, than a coherent philosophy, which some have tried to apply in an educational context?
Behaviorism in the philosophy of education, could perhaps be a helpful section of the behaviorism article, but it doesn't seem to justify an article in its own right.   

I write in historical context about what has already happened in education not about what might be or could be, which leads me to suggest that your viewpoint is not one of an educator. As an educator, philosophies of learning and philosophies of instruction are distinct and that distinction is very important. The descriptive and the perscriptive are frequently confused in Wikipedia articles. Unraveling that confusion is a monumental task. the vocabulary used by Philosophy majors and Psychology majors overlaps with the work of Education majors but one does not exempt the other . . . and where there are differences, the differences are significant. Please exercise care in exempting the work of other disciplines . . . it does not lead to cooperation.   

  The Civility Barnstar Thanks for your help with the Philosophy of education article!

I think you need to review the ArbCom findings once again. It doesn't seem you've learned from all that's been discussed on the matters in general, or the specific concerns pertaining to you.   

There were specific concerns raised in that ArbCom about skeptics pushing their viewpoint. Placing an NPOV template on an article that uses exclusively mainstream sources because """"the topic is by definition pseudoscientific"""" is a classic example of the latter. I still have seen no justification for the template on the talk page that addresses the actual framework of the article. For example, which sources would you add, use less, or remove?   
Seems like you're setting yourself up for further ArbCom actions, and are sticking to a battleground mentality. Good luck with that.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back.

There were no diesel car engines on the domestic Soviet market. Soviet diesels were designed for tanks and army trucks, not consumer cars.

VAZ-343 diesel engine made in Barnaul, but it seems the producion of this car is very low, for testing purposes mostly; you can't find it in dealerships outside Togliatti. I'm just too lazy to incorporate lots of this and other useful information available on many Russian sites. Sorry.
The source for the names is the official corporate history of the VAZ, http://history.vaz.ru/cars/ Numeric model numbers like Lada 1200SL were the most used internationallly, and the Soviet """"AutoExport Corp."""" wouldn't be so flexible to appoint different naming schemes for each market, maybe excluding some major ones like the UK. I don't see any point in removing model names. Noone should remember all those crazy manufacturer codes, that's too much for cars that all are based on the Fiat 124 and differ only by say front fascia, like 21063 to 21033.
Don't bother with the Kalina, it's getting mostly mediocre reviews even from the loyal press. The promises were high but the build quality seems to stay on a level typical to VAZ (see The Object of Jokes) and the parts quality is not catching up. The sales of VAZ cars are falling since last year while the sales of foreign cars are increasing, and no further raise of the import tax will help if the VAZ won't improve, but just don't seem to be able to, as shown by the fiasco of their efforts to adapt Chevrolet Niva for export.

"""Scylla]]

Summary of Scylla
Scylla is supposed to be a beautiful nymph. A man called Glaucus fell in love with her. She didn’t like him and so ran away from him, effectively rejecting her. Therefore Glaucus went to a sorceress, Circe and asked for Scylla’s heart to be softened. Circe however fell in love with Glaucus who rejected her. Circe was angry at Scylla, not Glaucus and so, when Scylla was about to bathe, she poured a powerful poison into Scylla’s pool and so when Scylla bathed she turned into a horrible monster with twelve feet and six heads, all with 3 rows of teeth. Wolf heads grew from her waist and she just stood there, each one of her heads taking someone who passed her. She hated everything which came within reach and killed it.
What makes it a Good Story?
The story of the transformation of Scylla is a good story as it seems to make people realise their emotions when they hear about how Scylla was turned into an eternal being of pure evil even though she did nothing to anyone. She didn’t accept Glaucus’s love and so was turned into a supernatural being because of someone else’s jealousy of her looks.

3 Latin Words to Describe Scylla
Malus-evil
Miser- wretched/sad
Aliquid miri- something extraordinary

The Insight that the Myth Affords Into The Ancient World
This myth does not show us a lot about the ancient world as it is a myth and so does not show a representation of the real world then. It does show us however that Ovid believed strongly in superstition or that he was just an imaginative writer which is equally likely. We can get a glimpse of the colourful words which he uses to describe the dreadful transformation of Scylla.

In a late Greek myth,Recorded in Eustathius' commentary on Homer and John Tzetzes, Ad Lycophron. it was said that Heracles encountered Scylla during a journey to Sicily and slew her. Her father, the sea-god Phorcys, then applied flaming torches to her body and restored her to life.  

According to John TzetzesTzetzes, Ad Lycophron 45. and Servius' commentary on the AeneidServius on Aeneid iii. 420. Scylla was a beautiful naiad who was claimed by Poseidon, but Amphitrite turned her into a monster. 

It is said that by the time Aeneas' fleet came through the strait after the fall of Troy, Scylla had been changed into a dangerous rock outcropping which still stands there to this day.

The character of Sin from John Milton's Paradise Lost is similar to Scylla. Scylla and Charybdis are actually mentioned at one point in the poem.

 Self-aggrandizing POV? 
The phrase 'self-aggrandizing' has been removed several times for two reasons:
It's [[WP:POV|POV].
It's redundant, apparently because it's made clear by the rest of the article.
I'm not sure either of these reasons are valid.  What POV is the 'self-aggrandizing' phrase pushing?  It doesn't seem to be something either the GNAA's supporters or detractors would disagree with, making it unclear whether or not it's POV at all.  It seems to simply be an indisputable fact, evidenced by, among many other things, the article itself as well as the GNAA's website.  Also, if the statement is not POV, it can't be said to be inappropriately unbalancing the article by including the POV of one side and not the other; that the GNAA are a self-aggrandizing group is a simple fact.

Another reason given for the phrase's removal was that it was redundant.  That might be the case, but isn't redundancy not only acceptable, but desired in the first paragraph of an article, which is generally supposed to act as a summary?

I'm really not sure why this phrase is causing so much controversy.   """,0

Adding new cat Category:LGBT rights opposition is not appropriate here for reasons stated on the cat's Talk page section entitled, """"Cat violates Wiki policy?""""

Further, as illustrated on Concerned Women for America, the cat may be controversial, and cats are not used for controversial material.  The existence of controversy evidences the cat is inappropriate for the page.  In particular, WP:CAT says:

Particular considerations for categorizing articles:
It should be clear from verifiable information in the article why it was placed in each of its categories. Use the  template if you find an article in a category that is not shown by sources to be appropriate, or the  template if the article gives no clear indication for inclusion in a category.

Obviously, it is not """"clear from verifiable information in the article"""" if the wiki community keeps removing it.

on the Creator
The demiurge is an expression of philosophy, in that it is a Greek or Hellenistic cultural concept. This means that the Demiurge is a cultural concept from the Greeks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingness as non-substantive (ex-nihilo). They treated nothingness as a substance called aether. The Greeks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from """"something"""". Plato it was the good, Aristotle it was energy, Plotinus it was force. These are ontological noema that create consciousness in humans. This arises from the unique essence of Greek or Hellenistic philsophy treating the natural (physic) and supernatural (metaphysic) as extensions of human consciousness. So everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousness and therefore must be expressed from a anthropomorphic perspective. God or Gods can not be anything outside of human. That's why Zeus and the Gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them. The demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates. The Greek Orthodox Christian God is not relatiable to the Actus et potentia as the Roman Catholic God since, God in essence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make God's being, essence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the Ortohodox Christian God. The Christian God is not one (the monad) or unity according to St Dionysus the Areopagite.   
Orthodox Christianity did not have the same God therefore the """"concept of God"""" uses and has familiar language (between Hellenstic Greek and Byzantine Greek) but in essence, substance is a different concept of God. In Greek Orthodox Christianity (which Iamblichus kinda tried to graft into Neoplatonism after the fact) God is in and outside the Universe. God is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since God's consciousness ontologically is hyper-being. Meaning that God as a substance can not be detected nor contained. Now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis, immanence or existence (cataphatic). The Pagan philosophical God was a detectable substance that all things derive from and reduced to. The Orthodox Christian God is a hyper substance that is not empirically detectable. Mankind has to be altered in order to detect it. Since the God in Greek Orthodox Christianity in his trinitarian completeness (uncreatedness) does not have the same consciousness as mankind, did not share mankinds consciousness until he became a human being AKA Jesus Christ. The reverse is only true in Philosophy since in Orthodox Christianity God as a whole has a consciousness which is completely unrelatable to mankind. Philosophy God and mankind have the same consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Protestantism treat God ontologically very much as modalistic (like Sabellianism) which creates also a different consciousness. Orthodox Christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic-izing the Christian God, which can only come from not actually having experiencing the Christian God (theoria) and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic God of philosophy.

Hello,

I always welcome feedback for my efforts, most of which nowadays are editing and writing narrative nonfiction and novels.

And I do appreciate those who have studied the art and science of the English language, esp. grammar and usage. 

I especially love it when those who would criticize another's work do it decently and respectfully.

Having listened to the tone, color and texture of your message, I assume that you're not one of those I describe in paragraph two above. Further, I assume you're not diplomatic in your dealings with other people, in general. Either that, or you're just plain too lazy to be kind and decent. 

Telling me I'm """"wrong"""" is just plain rude, esp. when BOTH of us are correct, according to modern-day usage.

By the way, the correct way your sentence should've been structured is, """"No, you're wrong; it's perfectly acceptable."""" Of course, I may've said something like, """"You're both right, Dean. Happy editing and thank you for contributing to Wkipedia.""""

Of course, that's just I . . . or me, as it were. . . .

"As you will see below, I have formally nominated the article for deletion. Please state your case in the discussion there and others will respond. In general, we have tried to use registration as the bar for notability for political parties. In some cases such as Palmer United, this has been waived - PUP got major, nationwide coverage for months before it was registered, and also had two Queensland state MPs within its ranks very quickly. Should the new Country Party (which is, I should add, extraordinarily unlikely to achieve registration under its current name) receive that kind of coverage, or get some defectors in its ranks, then we might make an exception for it too. In the meantime, this is simply a case of WP:TOOSOON.

""":Thanks Tom - that's a much better summary than the previous one. One question: in the comparison of UKIP's performance to that of other parties, I think saying that the SNP polled less than UKIP could be misleading for non-UK readers. If I didn't know that the SNP only stood candidates in Scotland, I'd get the impression from the current text that UKIP did much better than the SNP on average. But knowing that UKIP put up candidates across the country (while the SNP didn't) gives quite a different impression, since, of course, the SNP polled much better than UKIP everywhere it put up candidates. So for the benefit of non-UK readers, in the section comparing UKIP's performance to that of the Lib Dems and SNP, perhaps it might be helpful to add """"ahead of the Scottish National Party (who only contested seats in Scotland)""""?

I won't make that addition unless you approve, though.

Oh, one more thing - do we have a quote from a UKIP official or UKIP press release on the official reaction to the election result, or a link to an article about it?

Given the unique nature of comicbook material, we give them leeway on relying a good deal on primary sources.  It's only when those articles seeks something beyond a C, such as GA or FA status that third-party sources become imperative.  Now give, many of the minor superhero character pages out there are really stubs with little future, it's all about where you stand on the inclusionist/deletionist philosophy on Wikipedia.  Do you give leeway to small-interest articles in because we have nearly infinite resources, or do you hold everything to the rules?  Personally, I lean more toward keeps than deletes, except for extreme cases.

In any case, I Rictor may pass for GA.  You can check out a similar character I worked on and moved to GA (Anole (comics)).  That really go there because I trimmed through FCH, and had a lot of third party sources on some plot lines that involved him and the character's creation.  The layout for an FA article would probably cut through a lot of character history and focus on publication history.  It offends some people to see what they consider """"notable character history"""" cut, but if you want an accessible article, you have to do it.  Superman arguably has a ton of character history, but it's really just distilled down to the basic iconic things that others write about: Krypton, orphan, country boy, Metropolis, Louis Lane, Lex Luther, Justice League, etc.  I'm trying to find the time to do the same to Jean Grey.

 Bringing Up To Standards 

To avoid edit warring, let's work by consensus. I think it's agreed that statements need to be cited, and that it's not enough to cite, but to reflect the source accurately. Statements that are either uncited or incorrectly cited need to be corrected, or removed. 

Starting from the top, there's this sentence: """"The status of dhimmi applied to millions of people living from the Atlantic Ocean to India from the 7th century until modern times [citation needed]. """" Can we agree to substute 'until modern times' with something more appropriate? I suggest something like """"from the 7th century, and is still practiced in countries such as..."""". Since only a handful of countries actually apply Shariah, and only few that practice it still hold the dhimma thing, this shouldnt be a problem.  """,0

I do not know how far you up to date with the conflict that is keeping editors from editing the page. If not, I suggest you have a look at the arbitration case that is currently pending.  

To facilitate, this was the version most people (except Marcosantezana) could live with:

Natural selection is the process in which individual organisms that possess favourable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.  Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.

The term was introduced by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book """"The Origin of Species"""", as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock, which Darwin called artificial selection.

Maybe you find it not god, and in that case, I am curious what you think of that.

"I'm afraid I'm not much help here. My knowledge here is that of an interested lay observer only. With that caveat, I'll answer your two-part question.

First, I'm not aware of a book dedicated on the topic of 1988 uprising or even the late 1980s up to the 1990 election. A meaningful book on the topic should in part contain information based on interviews with those involved from all sides, not just based on the account of the exiles. Given that the political climate has just recently improved, I'm sure such a meaningful book is yet to be written. Now, I still think that the military will not fare well even in a more balanced light. (No excuse for killing your own people, and shutting down the education system for a decade. Talk about a lost generation. Talk about cutting the nose to spite the face!)

Second, yes, I've heard some in the military wanted a Golkar-style arrangement (i.e. institutionalized role of the military in parliament/politics) but I'm not aware of a formal public proposal. I'm not sure if that proposal ever had the support of the top brass of the military. Then again, I can also see DASSK rejecting such an offer in the 1990s. As much as I admire her personal courage and integrity, I always thought she should have been more flexible. She was never a natural politician like her father who was a pragmatic person and actually got things done. Not sure which National Assembly you mean. AFAIK, the military did an about face after the 1990 elections that the elections were not to convene the assembly but to write a new constitution. HTH.",0

 Christianity and its Polytheistic Attributes  

Here are some credible, scholarly sources, as requested, for the statement about Christianity and how it is believed to be polytheistic. I request that editors maintain an impartial approach when dealing with Christianity-related articles and other religious articles. I further request that editors acknowledge the polytheistic elements of the Christian faith, the controversy around the issue, and that Christianity believed to be polytheistic by some. 

It says in the American Encyclopedia (an academic accredited work): 

""""The belief in the Oneness of God – as a theological movement – began at a very early stage in history, and in fact it preceded the belief in trinity by many decades. Christianity developed from Judaism, and Judaism firmly believes that there is one God. 

The path that led from Jerusalem (the home of the first disciples of Christ) to Nicea (where it was decided in 325 CE that Christ was equal to God in essence and eternal nature) can hardly be described as a straight path. 

The doctrine of trinity which was affirmed in the fourth century CE bears no resemblance to the original teachings of Christ concerning the nature of God. Au contraire, it is the opposite, a deviation from that teaching. Hence it developed in opposition to the belief in One God… (27/294)"""" 

Will Durant, in his The Story of Civilization says: 

""""When Christianity conquered Rome, the new religion (i.e., Christianity) was infused with the blood of the old idolatrous religion: the title of archbishop, worship for the great mother, and an innumerable number of lords who gave peace of mind and were like who exist in all places and cannot be detected with the senses. All of this came into Christianity as the blood of the mother comes into her child. 

The civilized empire handed over power and administration to the papacy and the impact of the word replaced the impact of the sword. The preachers of the church started to assume positions of power. 

Christianity did not put an end to idolatry, rather it reinforced it. The Greek mind came back to life in a new form, in the doctrines and rituals of the church. The Greek rituals appeared in the rituals of the monastic saints. From Egypt came the idea of the holy trinity, the day of reckoning, eternal reward and punishment, and man’s eternal life in one of the other. From Egypt also came the worship of the mother and child, the mystical union with God, the union which led to Platonism and agnosticism, and the erasing of Christian doctrine. And from Persia came the belief in the return of the Messiah and his ruling the earth for 1000 years. 

Despite the element of atheism in the words of Durant, which is something that he is known for, and which is apparent in his claim that the idea of eternal reward or punishment came from the Egyptians, tracing the origins of deviant idolatry in Christianity is no longer a secret, and he is not the only one who has researched them. In his book Christianity and Idolatry, Robertson states that Mithraism, which is a religion of Persian origin, flourished in Persia approximately six centuries before the birth of Christ, and it reached Rome around the year 70 CE, where it spread throughout the Roman lands. Then it reached Britain and spread to a number of British cities. What concerns us here about this religion is that it says: 

-         That Mithras, after whom it is named, was an intermediary between God and man (for a similar doctrine in Christianity, see Acts 4:12).

-         He was born in a cave or in a corner of the earth (cf. Luke 2:8)

-         His birthday was December 25 (which is the day celebrated by the Christians as the day when Jesus was born)

-         He had twelve disciples (cf. Matthew 10:1)

-         He died to save the world (cf. I Corinthians 15:3)

-         He was buried but he came back to life (cf. I Corinthians 15:4)

-         He ascended to heaven in front of his disciples (cf. Acts 1:9)

-         He was called “Saviour” (cf. Titus 2:13)

-         Among his attributes is that he is like a peaceful lamb (cf. John 1:29)

-         The “Divine supper” was held in his memory every year (cf. I Corinthians 11:23-25)

-         One of his symbols was baptism

-         Sunday was sacred to them """"

This is an oooold subject/section here, but I agree, the highly detailed diagram is quite scary-looking to a novice reader, and much more complicated than the basics of the topic.

Tony, thanks for the apology. However, it really doesn't alter the fact that Wikipedia as a body has been entirely hypocritical in regard to sceptics of global warming.

Frankly I am less interested than comparisons between coordination between with the list vs watchlist coordination than opaque coordination (list or watchlist) vs transparent collaboration.

I am not suggesting you only present evidence against EE list members.  Or even that it really be focused on individual editors.  What has the existence of a Battleground done to articles in this topic area, is really what I want to know.  While EE editors have apologized for some personal offenses, I believe that none of them have shown understanding that they harmed Wikipedia.  I am probably wrong about none, but I can't recall this.  I can't say that I have even paid much attention to this at the individual editor level.  Except to be honest I feel a bit differently about the admin. Mostly I want support for the argument that the whole Battleground approach is inferior.

"""The person who said that it was hit by a missile was the brother of someone on the airplane. Clearly he is going to be emotional and not a worthwhile source. The fact of the matter is that the first patrol to come across the wreckage was asked to investigate because the Joint Defense Operations Center on base detected the sound of the plane crashing into the ground. Bear in mind that the sound detector is used to listen for mortars and would hear a """"missile"""" hitting the aircraft. Also, the reason the JDOC sent the first patrol to investigate was because the cameras that observe around the base were obstructed by the fog. This was the thickest fog I have ever seen. My section was the second section to be called up to respond to the crash. The first section to go out picked up the two barely surviving individuals and my section picked up the bodies with the pararescuemen. I was driving and I could barely see 75m ahead of my truck. There is absolutely no way that the enemy could spot the plane in the fog and shoot it down. Shooting down an aircraft is not an easy task for insurgents in the first place, shooting down a plane in that thick of fog, with a """"missile?"""" (insurgents don't have missiles), and having a """"missile"""" that doesn't make a sound is not possible and should not be given any credence. Also, the plane did not crash """"1.5 miles"""" from the base. The hull of the plane and all the wreckage was about 200m from the fence, consistent with an attempted landing.

JANZEN* Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 Communicated by Gordon H. Orians, April 29, 1994 (received for review January 3, 1994) [].

I suggest the connection between the concern over global warming and extinction be returned to article based on this passage:

The causal influence of annual variation in climatic temperature on cohort sex ratios in this population of painted turtles serves as a clear empirical example of the biological impact portended by rapid global temperature change. This study demonstrates that the demography of populations of species with temperature-dependent sex determination may be directly sensitive even to modest deviations in the local thermal environment. These results are entirely consistent with earlier work on a nesting beach of endangered loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), wherein 87-99% of hatchlings from the rookery in each of 3 years were females because sand temperatures at nest level were high (39). If such strongly female-biased cohorts lead to highly skewed adult sex ratios, then the probability of population extinction may be greatly enhanced.

 Revision of January 2012 
I've just conducted a major revision of this article. Besides completely rewriting the lede, I've noticed a number of issues with the article, and I explain the rationale behind my editing choices with regard to those issues below:
 """"Tendency"""", in the first line of the article, had a """"clarification needed"""" tag. I was at first unsure how to """"clarify"""" a word that seemed pretty clear to me. Nonetheless, recognising that those not well-versed in left-wing political terminology would have difficulty understanding what it meant in that context, I've linked it to School of thought as the closest alternative. If anyone can think of a better way to clarify its meaning, please do;
 This article used a mixture of Commonwealth and North American spelling. It has no clear national ties to any English-speaking country. As such, based on the Wikipedia Manual of Style's guidelines, I've standardised to Commonwealth spelling as that was both the predominant, and (as a search through the article's edit history will reveal) the first spelling variation to be used;
 There was a large amount of unencyclopedic language and (very) mild POV pushing. I've brought much of this article back in line with NPOV to the best of my abilities;
 I've italicised all references to the """"Platform"""", as it is the short-hand of a book title. Additionally, it needs to be pointed out that """"platformism"""" ought to be written with a lower-case P; similar to """"anarchism"""" and """"communism""""; and
 Finally, I've removed all redlinks; as they make the article look unprofessional.

Traditionally, Canada's Aboriginal peoples hold that they have resided on their lands since the beginning of time, while archaeological studies support a human presence in the northern Yukon from 26,500 years ago, and in southern Ontario from 9,500 years ago. The first Europeans to arrive were the Vikings, who settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows around 1000 AD, after which there was no further trans-Atlantic contact until John Cabot explored Canada's east coast for England in 1497, followed by French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1534. In the early 17th century, Samuel de Champlain founded the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal and Quebec City, from which the French colonists extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and the present-day Maritimes, while French fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana. Concurrently, the English established fishing outposts on Newfoundland and established the Thirteen Colonies to the south.
'' on the Plains of Abraham at Quebec in 1759, part of the Seven Years' War.]]

Due to the close proximity of these two European powers, a series of wars over both territory and the fur trade errupted between 1689 and 1763, such as the French and Iroquois Wars, the four Intercolonial Wars, and the Seven Years' War. Via the peace treaties that concluded these conflicts, Acadia and most of New France was ceeded to Britain, which then, through the 1763 Royal Proclamation, carved the Province of Quebec out of New France, annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia, and placed all the former French territories under common law; six years later, St. John's Island became a separate colony. By 1774, the Quebec Act reestablished civil law in Quebec and reaffirmed the right of its population to practice their Catholic faith, as well as expanding the province's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, all of which helped to fuel the American Revolution. From that conflict, some 50,000 persons loyal to the Crown fled to Canada, where new regions were created to accomodate them: New Brunswick was split from Nova Scotia, and Quebec was divided into Upper an",0

""" or typology) of three potential interpretive references.

First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes as per the Book of Daniel.

Given that many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt, they would say that the Old Testament reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying """"Theos Epiphanes"""" (God manifest), etc.

In Revelation, John borrowed the """"Son of Perdition"""" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to """"the star that fell from heaven"""" by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. The Greek name is """"Appolyon,"""" from the Greek root word """"apolumi."""" It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation."""" The Hebrew name is """"Abaddon,"""" from the Hebrew root word """"'abad,"""" which means the same thing as the Greek root word. In the Book of Daniel, the interpreter says that the eventual destiny of the """"great beast"""" is to be """"destroyed"""" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (i.e. hell).

Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot

In John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the """"son of perdition"""". The New International Version translates the phrase as """"the one doomed to destruction."""" D. A. Carson suggests that this verse refers both to Judas' character and to his destiny.D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Leicester: Apollos, 1991), 563.""",0

 Censorship 

at User_talk:Bad_girl_1701 you've stated that """"removing articles from Wikipedia has nothing to do with censorship."""" we've been so trained to recoil from """"censorship"""" that the word is apparently losing its meaning. the problem at hand is not censorship, but rather the mistaken belief that censorship isn't supposed to occur at wikipedia (and that it's inherently evil).

the WP:NOT article is essentially censorship policy. that is good, because  wikipedia couldn't function without censorship. deleting articles at wikipedia has everything to do with censorship. intelligent, proper censorship should be lauded, not denied. censorship, like discrimination (another necessary action practiced here intentionally), is usually not a bad thing, but we're programmed to recoil from even considering the possibility that we engage in either of those often worthy practices. wikipedia is private property, and speech restrictions are an essential right of property owners.

- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

Oh I have gone ahead and done this. I think that page can be deleted now. There wasn't much on it. I hope you are happy with the way things are set out now. 

About the structure of the article generally, I have a few points:

I think that there should be a section for each daughter section, and that this should pretty much just be a quick rundown of that page, of the important parts in that page.
The 'research into health benefits' should be moved to the third party page, and only one study mentioned briefly on the main pagethe one that appeared in a journal, the other maybe should not be mentioned. Does not warrant a section to itself, at any rate. (will just go ahead and do this now)
Take out epoch times section. It is related to Falun Gong, but it is not of the same nature as the other sections, like beliefs and teachings, falun gong overseas, persecution etc.. There can be some 'related pages' mention of it, I think that would be appropriate, but basically it is not specifically a part of the Falun Gong cycle of articles, though related to them. 

that's all for now. There's plenty of work to do on all these though.12345 """,0

It's a newbie test, resulting from clicking the buttons above the edit window.  | T@lk 

I think that the article hematology should define hematology (as in what a hematologist does), not blood diseases.  We should create that article separately.  

I think that haematologist and haematology should remain separate pages.  They are not the same.  It is easy to click on a link to look up haematologist on the haematology page.  

I disagree. Being a hematologist is practicing hematology. Hematology is not just the diseases but just as much diagnostics, epidemiology and laboratory medicine. Together with gastroenterology it is one of the few fields that has retained its own diagnostic process (no need to send the blood film to a dedicated expert). I'd suggest moving the diseases to a seperate page and using this page to mention the main ones (red cells, white cells, transfusion and coagulation).  | T@lk 

SPELLING!
Can we please have this page retitled as hematology. It is NOT spelt hematology, sorry if american people think it is spelt like that. But ARGGGHHH, doctors were around in england long before america, the language was born here, spelling it wrongly just makes you look stupid -  regards  .

I think there is room in the world for both spellings as all things evolve differently in different locations. Including language and it's details.

 Since when were doctors in England before America? Native Americans practiced medicine. And if you refer to doctors as practitioners of modern Western medicine, remember that at the time America became a country, doctors were still trying to save people by bleeding them. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 67.173.46.246  .

 There is a redirect from haematology to hematology, so we English will find the page.  

The page was at Haematology until  changed it to Hematology in an edit on the 5th of November, 2004, apparently in order to """"keep the American spelling into Wikipedia"""". According to Wikipedia policy, it should have stayed at Haematology (there is no preference for US English in Wikipedia), but it has been at the (admittedly awful) title of """"Hematology"""" for so long, trying to get it restored may be something of a fruitless exercise. C'est la Vie! )  

I think that probably we should leave it at hematology because moving it would provoke the opposite argument and there is a redirect, after all.  """,0

Please provide the correct edit summary next time if you wish to put my edits under the microscope. Subsequent edit summaries were during reverts, which were naturally more limited in description. Even those asked whether the reverting editor wanted additional cites([the revision history clearly shows])I was prepared to provide them on request. It takes two hands too clap. You didn't answer my question: are you both interested in resolving this dispute or something else?

"I did not liken Blackworm to Hitler, I said that Blackworm appeared to have nothing positive to say about circumcision and then commented that most topics have some positive aspects, for example, Hitler was supposedly fond of dogs. My comparison was between circumcision and Hitler, not between Blackworm and Hitler. I apologized immediately Blackworm made me aware that he felt offended. It was not my intention to offend or insult him and while I might perhaps have expressed myself better, I still do not think that my comment can be taken as abusive by anyone who is not hypersensitive. Please look at the message I left Blackworm in his comment above and judge for yourself. I had asked Blackworm a question on his personal talk page because of a genuine interest in the answer and aware that Blackworm might legitimately choose not to answer it. However, if Blackworm refuses to respond to my questions on THIS talk page, I think it reflects more on him than on me and harms the discussion rather than furthering it. As such, since Blackworm claims to have accepted my apology, I hope that he will reply to my message above.",0

"Discussion on this matter also underway at Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Attack sites/Proposed decision#New proposals concerning Cyde.  

I agree with Fred. Viridae, I'm going to pretend for a moment that I believe the SlimVirgin engaged in abusive sockpuppetry. The account had not been used for two years, so there was no urgency. There is a precedent for letting people in similar situations give a private explanation, and only to sanction them if they refuse or fail. It was not possible to provide public evidence without giving further publicity to a website which engages in stalking, and which gave speculation about not only SlimVirgin's identity, but also another contributor's. And you seem to be overlooking the fact that Cyde was in a longstanding dispute with SlimVirgin, so obviously should not have been the one to block. See also . This is not a question of making a mistake in believing WordBomb. This is a question of believing WordBomb, and then, instead of reporting it privately to the ArbCom, or asking SlimVirgin privately for an explanation, engaging in extremely inappropriate, hasty, behaviour, even crowing over the person he was accusing of sockpuppetry, and showing most clearly that he had a grudge against her. Additionally, in another case which is being heard at the moment, a user who had originally registered with his real name requested a name change, and repeatedly asked people not to keep referring to him by his old name, and Cyde responded by provocatively posting a link to the user rename log.

"slow the VFDTOAFD bot down? 

Hello,

Would it be possible to slow the VFDTOAFD bot down?  It's not overwhelming the bandwidth or resources of Wikipedia, but it is overwhelming the ability of human eyes to monitor the pagemove log (more than 5000 edits today alone).  Once any currently-being-voted-on VfD's are converted to AfD (I think that happened already quite some time ago), the old archived ones can be converted at much more leisurely pace, no?  Perhaps a few hundred a day?  Hardly anyone ever really looks at old archived VfD's, so there's no screaming urgency.  My worry is specifically that vandals may sneak in some pagemove vandalism in there that no one will catch, in the midst of thousands and thousands of other pagemoves, or a vanity userspace page will get moved to article space and no one will catch it (last time I checked, such a pagemove didn't show up in the Newpages log).

I'm afraid I missed the earlier section on Margate's page, my mistake. However, """"duplication"""" apart, am wondering about your reasoning of """"vague/dubious"""" as these criteria are ones I have seen on any number of non-league club pages or why the section was not deleted after the earlier addition of Barry Thornley (not by me!) which created it (the section)?

First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world.

 Olympic 

Formation and early years
The name was chosen by James Edmondson, the club's first treasurer, and is believed to have been inspired by the recent excavation of Olympia, site of the ancient Olympic Games. It's referenced by Phythian, p. 7?
Yes, that's right    
Decline and colapse
In 1886 the club's committee was forced to reduce the players' wages to a quarter of what was being offered by Preston North End. Why it is comparing with the PNE? It's because some players went to play there?
Simply because PNE were the top club in the area.  It shows how much worse Olympic's wages were compared to the top club in the area.  Hope that makes sense    
Rivalries
The rivalry became especially fierce in September 1884, when, amid accusations that the clubs were using underhand tactics in attempts to """"poach"""" each others' star players, the Rovers' secretary sent a telegram to his opposite number stating that his club would play no matches against Olympic in the 1884–85 season.

 Suggestions to impove the article

Lead

 Your writing has a lot of adverbs like """"originally"""" """"primarily"""" """"mainly"""", these aren't necessary.  Sometimes they have a place but they also clutter up the prose and many of them can be removed.
 Third cable channel behind disney and nick.  Third in what?  Kids' programming?  It's not clear.
 Overall in the lead the writing is choppy and needs to be streamlined.  Here's an example:
""""Since 2009, it began airing a small amount of live-action programming, specifically movies from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema, both of which are also owned by Time Warner.""""  Rewrite like this, """"In 2009 it started airing live-action programming, including movies from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema.""""  No one cares that they're owned by Time Warner.
 See WP:LEAD for instructions on what should be in a good lead.  The lead should be a summary of the entire article and this lead should be enhanced to include every subject within the article (written in a summary style).

History

 The clean up banner is legitimate and should be addressed.  Usually clean up banners should be handled before the article is listed at WP:PR.  I can see a number of  templates in the following sections.  These should be addressed and the sourcing improved.
 As a general rule every paragraph should have at least one source, and more if there are multiple assertions.
 See WP:INCITE for reference anchor placement.  They don't go in the middle of the sentence but rather at the end unless the assertion is very controversial.
 The parenthetical reference in the first sentence is too detailed.  Give a few examples of what was acquired and leave it at that.
 Watch out for one sentence paragraphs.  These stubs are not acceptable at GAC.  Consider combining or expanding.
 Make sure titles are always italicized even when not linked.
 What is meant by the """"Powerhouse era""""?  What is powerhouse music?  

Programming

 This is a section with no prose.  Not good.  Sections with just a tophat are unnecessary.  Either add some prose or remove the section.  I think you fold in most of the programming info in the previous section.

Related projects

References

 The key to references is consistency.  Make sure every website ref has at least the title, url, publisher, and accessdate.
 You probably want to use templates like  to help with consistency.
 Deviantart appears to be a blog or discussion forum.  This is not a credible reference.  See WP:CITE and WP:VERIFY for instructions on credible references.  Avoid blogs, forums, chat rooms, social networking sites etc.

Overall

 As stated above the article needs a lot more referencing.  This will be a major sticking point if you want it to pass GAC.  * I would also seek out someone who can do a thorough copy edit.
 There isn't much about the financing of the channel, advertising revenue, demographics that sort of thing.  It would be nice to see some more information on these topics.

There is no OFFICIAL evidence incriminating Osama as the evil doer. 
This reinforces why all accusations of Muslim terrorist attack should have proper quotation.
If you lack such sources (which I claim you do) we do not need your opinion to provide the rest of reality.

Your lies as """"the truth"""" here in wikipedia
The suggestion there would be sufficient proof or even mainstream consensus about the event is a clear lie. I personally find it unimaginable that wikipedia has a page where Muslim Extremists are claimed to be the cause leaving no room for any sensible explanation.

no references to  Obstruction of justice huh? 
The article should clearly mention the great effort the Bush administration made of hiding all the evidence. This was the main embodiment of the attack. Obstruction of justice of this scale is a far bigger crime as murder.

FOLLOW THE MONEY!
The page should mention Larry Silverstein owned the building for a day and a half and maxed out the insurance for multiple terrorist attacks. Thus he cashed in multiple times.

the Muslim extremist terrorists label kit
A discussion about using the word Terrorist seems to provide an interesting vessle to obstruct the discussion. It has repeatedly been made clear the word terrorist attack can be used to explain the event but there is no ground to keep calling those who staged the event Muslim extremist terrorists.""",0

""""That sentence assumed that there was wrongdoing. The rest of that section still implies it by the juxtaposition of the funding information with the report details. You may think that this is obvious, but we need a source that explicitly states that the findings of the the UT report were influenced by the funding received.""""Perhaps personal correspondence with the authors of the Texas study admitting their findings were indeed swayed by the knowledge that the business interests of major donors to their institution and research programmes would likely be substantially affected in the negative if said findings did not produce a clean bill of health for fracking? I mean, that's about the only way you could ever meet your demand. What an utterly absurd request. It's easy to see why it was made, though: just set the bar so high it can't be jumped, then use the failure as an excuse to chop out what you don't like. Maybe you'd have me hack the e-mail accounts of the authors, fish around for evidence (assuming there is even any there), then leak it to a major newspaper so they can write an article that I can cite on here. Only the most naive idiot can fail see the potential for conflict of interest from a study put out by Texas. The university's state is the heart and soul of US oil & gas, but that's certainly not worthy of so much as a mention given that which is also true: the university has multi-million-dollar and other links with the largest provider of fracking services in the United States, not to mention other oil & gas companies with interests in fracking. I have no idea whether their report was swayed by industry links, but only a fool would suggest the potential isn't there. If you don't like the juxtaposition, just open up a gap with a caveat—and make it as weak, pathetic and denigrating as you like for all I care, maybe something like, """"socialist—nay, communist!—campaigners in the pay of a European Maoist group have alleged a potential for a conflict of interest, noting that..."""" For comparison, take the recent global-warming sceptics at the Heartland Institute: as soon as details of the Institute's funding were leaked, they were prominently reported in the press. We don't even need leaks here, the information is freely available to anyone who takes the time to find it out, as Smm201`0 and others have done. All you are interested in doing is eliminating even mention of perfectly obvious potential for conflict of interest. According to Ian Urbina, we can't even get a decent, untarnished report out of the EPA; unlike Texas, the EPA doesn't even take industry funding, for god's sake, yet still it can't escape heavy industry pressure to redact. Aside from irrelevances like minor earthquakes, I have no idea whether fracking is causing all the problems it is alleged to, though I am extremely suspicious given the documented efforts of industry (and their paid-for puppets in government) to tone down or eliminate negative findings, and the truly just ridiculous claims about fracking's potential by people like Lord Browne here in England. And I couldn't care less if fracking's safe or not. Why should I? or anyone? If it's not, it's not; if it is... it is! Outside of a lunatic asylum, who would care? If it is safe (enough), bring it on: jobs, tax receipts, increased energy security, reduced use of coal burning... only a fool wouldn't be interested in those things, particularly given the current economic situation.

 External forcing 

This refers.  It would be useful to explain this term better (I have a comment further up the talk page).  Does it refer to any process external to the climate?  Including thought processes?  Or to processes that have some effect on the climate.  Also it is highly confusing to have a section titled 'radiative forcing' when it begins with a (bad) definition of external forcing.  My point is a logical one only.  Also, do you agree with my comments on the GW talk page where I argue for more explanation of the reasons scientists believe in GW.  Also a better definition of GW. Is it (a) the fact that instrument temperatures are on average higher than a century ago (b) a process that underlies that fact (c) the hypothesis that the process has an anthropogenic cause?  These are all different things. (a) could be true because of random fluctuations (b) could be true if the process were a natural one.  Again, my points are only logical and definitional ones, I have no view on the science.   18:",0

"Explanation of undo 

Just to elaborate a little more on my undo in this edit.

It is true that at some level you can always replace a function by a relation giving the same information.  For a unary function symbol f, you can substitute a relation symbol R, and interpret it via R(x,y) if and only if f(x)=y.

However, there are significant differences between languages that contain function symbols and ones that have only relation symbols.  Function symbols have existential import, in the sense that if you have a structure for a language with a function symbol f, and a closed term t in the language, then the structure must contain an interpretation for f(t).  Relation symbols don't give you that; a structure for a language containing our relation symbol R above is not guaranteed to have an object y such that the structure satisfies R(t,y).

This is important for lots of tools used to analyze structures.  For example, the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game is usually defined for languages that have only relation and constant symbols.  If you allow non-nullary function symbols, the analysis gets more complicated.",0

 From Norway; Denmark; Iceland; Scotland; England(Bristol etc.); Wales; Ireland; Basques & Others(""""again"""",more data) 

by Gunnar Thompson

""""On DeVirga's map, the northwestern continent is called """"Norveca.""""  This title, appearing under the symbol of a crown, identifies the huge land as a province under the sovereignty of Norway.  Other maps also show a huge land attached to northern Norway.  On the 14th-century Andreas Walsperger map, the region is called """"Regnii Norwegie"""" (the realm of Norway); maps by Sebastian Munster (1532) and Joachim Von Watt (1534) call the region """"Septentrio;"""" a circular map by Battista Agnese 1543 shows """"Terra Nova"""" extending from Norway to the North Pole.  

Maps that portray a huge northern territory reflect the 1261 proclamation of King Haakon IV extending Norse sovereignty over all the lands from Norway to the North Pole.  The """"North Pole"""" he had in mind was the magneticnot the geographic pole.  A 14th-century writer, Philippe de Mezieres, reported that Norway's overseas realm was so extensive that it took three years for the king's tax collectors to complete their rounds and return to Bergen.  

One of the territories that Haakon annexed in a 1262 treaty along with Greenland and Iceland was an otherwise obscure place called landanu or """"New Land.""""  The Kongfriget Norges historie (1778) identified an Icelander named Rolf as the discoverer of this New Landalso known as Nyalandin 1258.  It was also identified as part of the North American mainland.  Bishop Gissur Einarsson noted that the direction of sailing to Nyaland from Iceland was southwest.  In that direction lies Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  

The region had many names that changed over the years as successive waves of Europeans landed on its shores.  As late as 1347, Icelanders referred to Newfoundland as """"Markland""""which was an ongoing source of lumber.  Sailors from Bristol called the coastal isles """"the Icelands.""""  Circa 1350, a Spanish Franciscan reported an isle called """"Ibernia"""" in the northwest Atlantic that was under Norse sovereignty.  After that date, Bubonic Plague swept through European cities devastating maritime centers.  Norway was particularly hard hitforcing the abandonment of overseas colonies.  English, Portuguese, French, German, and Danish merchants fought over the western isles.  After 1380, Denmark took control of Greenland, Iceland, and mainland in eastern Canada.  The """"new"""" Danish mainland appears on the Claudius Clavus map of 1424 as """"Gronlandia Provincia.""""  Thus, the name """"Norveca"""" was already archaic by the early 15th century when it found its way onto DeVirga's map.  Portuguese maps of the early 16th century feature the names of Joao Fernandes (The Labrador) and the Corte-Real family along the East Coast of North America...""""  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.113.163.75   
Gunnar Thompson has also published on Marco Polo’s secret missions to Canada and the ancient Egyptian colonization of Mexico. He has compiled an """"Extensive collection of evidence (maps, artifacts, and cultural similarities) of voyages to North America before Columbus, by Phoenicians, Norse, Celts, Britons, Jews, Greeks, Irish, Romans, Japanese, Hindus, Indo-Sumerians, and Chinese. Native Americans are the first discoverers, occupying the Americas for at least 300,000 years."""" (from the Laura Lee radio show website) He is as reliable a source as Gavin Menzies. He has told me that the word hurricane comes from the ancient Greek.   

Well, the dear Dougweller can claim quite rightly in many cases that the relate of Marco Polo could be speculation, however Gunnar Thompson cites the words of his own reporting and book, book attributed to him, Marco Polo, as a documental source for these claims in the American Pacific coast, as well as indirect sources more speculative on the several centuries later(and even from his time) world maps, wich indicate where the lands designated by the Chinese and by the Venetian-Dalmatian Explorer were.

What is more, practically no major younger figures of the New Complexity were included among the published articles, whereas, for instance, Erik Ulman, who is a very fine composer but not a New Complexity composer, was included.

Secondly, I would beg you to not play childish games by removing composers I have posted. You have done fine work on Stockhausen, but you are by no means an expert on the subject of New Complexity. I have not seen a single article of yours focusing on this subject. I have never seen you at any of the festivals in which numerous works of younger composers associated with the New Complexity were performed, such as the bludenzer tage of the 1990's of the Züricher Tage of the early 1990's.  Why would you dare to remove Wolfram Schurig, co-editor of the primary book series focused on the New Complexity, leader of the bludenzer tage in its most daring period, and composer commissioned by leading ensembles throughout Europe?  If you don't know anything about him, this reflects badly on your claim to be an expert in this field.  Why would you remove Klaus K. Hübler, whose influence on New Complexity composers is clearly stated in multiple articles in the New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century series. Marc André has received numerous prestigious awards and commissions, and his work has also been closely associated with New Complexity; one need only read his articles appearing in the New Music and Aesthetics series to find support for this assertion.

I would strongly suggest that you do your homework in this field before you go about arbitrarily altering the contributions of others.  You could begin by going through the first six volumes of the New Music and Aesthetics series, then read numerous articles in Musik & Âsthetik (several references that appeared earlier in this entry have been removed) and works by Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf and others.  Then visit several dozen festival in Europe over an extended period. Then do some score study, perhaps beginning with the composers whose names you have removed.

""""And a couple more texts are required if you study quantum theory related to those subjects"""" Quantum theory started by a German Max Planck, but nobody knew its real mathematical background therefore it remained just a semi-science, until a Hungarian János Neumann made it. Lot of famous scientist of the era tried to made the mathematical background of the Q.theory but its proved to difficult for them. Neumann redefinied the definitions, he pointed out serials of former serious errors. He made Q. theory to a calculable science which made it a practicable science for industry. He invented the famous game theory and designed the world-famous ENIAC digital computer too.(ENIAC, short for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer,[1][2] was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was a Turing-complete, digital computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems.[3] ENIAC was designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, but its first use was in calculations for the hydrogen bomb. When ENIAC was announced in 1946 it was heralded in the press as a """"Giant Brain"""". It boasted speeds one thousand times faster than electro-mechanical machines, a leap in computing power that no single machine has since matched. This mathematical power, coupled with general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists.) Neumann was the main mathematican in Manhattan Project. Other famous Hungarian was Jenő Wigner often reffered as the father of quantum mechanics. Other famous Hungarian: Leó Szilárd his invention changed the basis of nuclear science:  he invented the nuclear chain reaction and invented the nuclear reactor (and he invented with Wigner the first nuclear power station) as well as the first Particle accelerator. Therefore the nuclear physics became a practicable/utilizable science for mankind. As the inventor nuclear chain reaction, he realised foremost the atomic-bomb, he made the basic """"Cutaway Drawing"""" of the first atomic bomb. He asked Albert Einstein to write letter to president Roosevelt for the realization of a concrete nuclear Bomb. In Manhattan project dosens of scientist and hundreds of engineers worked for the realization of Szilárd's idea: a working atomic bomb from 1939-1944. An other Hungarian Ede Teller invented the H-bomb. And it is just particle quantum / nuclear physics. It is just a branch of physics.  We had dosens of similar great scientists in other branchs of the physics and natural sciences.
The exaggeratedly anglocentric Rico have never heard about these scientists. The expert historians of natural sciences are always shocked about great number of Hungarian scientists, how is it possible for such a little country.

Paul O'Connor, a laboratory technologist who assisted in the autopsy of President Kennedy, claimed that the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital was conducted in obedience to a high command of admirals and generals. O'Connor stated: 

There were kind of mysterious civilian people, in civilian clothes — were there [at Bethesda]. It seemed like they commanded a lot of respect and attention — sinister looking people. They would come up and look over my shoulder, or look over Dr. Boswell's shoulder, and run back, and they'd have a little conference in the corner.

But now I'll give you an example of why you shouldn't lend weight to them either, I  will also tell you why the results you have aren't at all reliable. Using the search term """"female genital cutting"""" does not tell us the context of the result google finds. I'll give you an excellent example of this: I googled """"female genital cutting"""" from 2010 to 2010, (link here:[]). I draw your attention to the 3rd result from the top (that is, the 3rd most relevant result that google could find across that entire year for that term), the title of this article is """"Sexual function in women with female genital mutilation"""". Given that the title of this article clearly favours the term FGM, I opened the pdf that google links to in order to find how exactly the term """"female genital cutting"""" was used in the article. This is the text I found on page 2 of that article: 
""""Worldwide, it is estimated that 100 to 140 million girls and women have undergone some form of FGM, and each year 2 million girls are thought to be at risk (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification is superior to terms used by the public or even some scholarly reviewed publications. The latter terms include female genital cutting, female circumcision, female Sunna circumcision, and Pharaonic circumcision.""""
If the 3rd result on the first page of google scholar search is already a result which is refuting the use of the term FGC, then I submit to you that you can't rely on google scholar results (or ratios of results) as a method of determining whether FGC is replacing or augmenting the term FGM. Also note that the 4th result also uses FGM in the title, and that the 6th result is another which is refuting the use of the term. If stats are what matter, then I'll put that into numbers. 33% of the top results for the term """"female genital cutting"""" for the year 2010 are refuting the use of the term female genital cutting.   20:52""",0

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.
Sincerely,
Michelle Rollins""",1

 Sigüenza y Góngora 

Hi Rockero, thanks for all the work on the Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora article. Interesting material, and I'd never seen it before.

I have one minor question. Was his father really born in America? I knew Carlos was, but I had assumed his father was from Spain, because of the royal tutoring.

 
The oversight can perhaps be attributed to haste. My sources mention nothing abut his birthplace, but a Continental birth is much more likely, given the timeframe and his position. I changed it to peninsular, only to discover the deficiencies in that article.
I presume you are referring to S y G's theories about the origin of the Olmecs and the evangelization of Thomas when you say you found the new material interesting? Such theories were actually quite common, and it appears that SyG was one of the first to come up with them, or maybe just the first to popularize them. The Mormons were way behind. 8)
One final note: I'm guessing that """"book examiner"""" is your translation of """"corregidor general"""". Is this correct? My English-language sources make use of the term """"censor"""", which I can only guess is one and the same as corregidor general. I have added Censor (Catholic Church) to the censor dab page, in hopes of composing an article on the post, but refrained from linking it from the SyG article. If I am in error, please correct me. Thanks for your comments, and the pic looks great,  
Yes, if I remember correctly he was listed as corregidor general, but I'm away from my encylopedias now and can't definitely verify that. I'm sure I can find a copy of Enciclopedia de México in a library here (I'm in Los Angeles now), but it may be a little while before I get to that. """"Book examiner"""" wasn't really my translation. I had no idea what the original term meant, but I found him referred to as """"book examiner"""" on a web page, and I identified the two. I think it's safe to assume all three terms refer to the same office.

"I know, and as I told, I am politically syncretic and simply want neutral Wikipedia articles.
For Canada and all other Commonwealth Realms (except for England itself), the monarch appoints a governor-general to take over his or her duties in the realms. Canada and any other country needs a monarchical head of state, because it's a neutral person (and not coming from any party) representing all the People and avoids the country to become a dictatorship. He or she stands for stability, democracy and justice. One only point I don't like on monarchies is that in most of present monarchies the husband of a reigning queen becomes Prince Consort instead of King Consort. That should be changed. And now to the USA: the president is not elected by the People, but by electors. Second, there are only two parties, which have real chances to become ruling parties due to the restrictions of the Constitution. And third, it has a first-past-the-post voting system like in England, which also favors the only two ruling parties. In England, it doesn't matter, because Con. Party and Lab. Party have different aims, while the Rep. and the Dem. Party have very similar aims. Only a few persons in them make exceptions such as Ron Paul, Randall Terry, Rick Santorum or Sarah Palin.

 Lying comes too easily to you Mr.Kannambadi 

Mr.Kannambadi, 

Do you know that your attitude is also an equal put off to those who wish to contribute genuinely to wikipedia, engage in healthy discussions and arguments?  It is obvious that trusting you to be sincere in your approach and thinking you to be respectful of fellow contributors, I come up with explanation, sometimes or many a times in detail about historical events. Mind you the expression detailed in victory and silent about defeats was the one given not by me but by you to Nishkid. 

Also, do not resort to blatant lying on these pages (which you are clearly doing, first by saying that I have no sources - be realized that others can also read and write - and second, you are deliberately with malafide intentions creating a misimpression in wikipedia that I was banned for abusing and lack of sources. Be informed that it was neither of those reasons, because the first time I was blocked by Blinguen, it was completely and absolutely without any reason and the second time Blinguen came into my page, he did not express any objections to my contributions or changes to the Chola page, but first he commented that he is blocking me for he thought my contributions were my personal opinions and because he blocked me, he first of all did not engage in any discussions with me or try to explain as to how to make postings in the right manner (though I had indeed sourced the material properly but had not referenced the same) with the result that I got blocked before getting to discuss or even adding the necessary references or citations.  But it is good, this way you are only exposing yourself displaying your lack of spirit of accommodation.

I think I have put it as succinctly as one can, but what can you do, you will go on yapping I am writing detailed messages and creating confusion and what not?  Do you remember the manner in which you so very contemptuously retorted upon my providing even the weblinks like visitchitradurga.com, unnecessarily resorting to instructing about keeping one’s patriotism under control…. That is the problem with people like you, when people give reasons you come up with such unhealthy excuses, when people want to discuss history instead of talking about sources and citations, you tell them to keep their patriotism under control or start alleging that what we try to contribute are devoid of sources or are straightaway our personal opinions. How wrong can you be?  Well, that’s how some people like you are in this world!!!

So your way is pretty clear; either avoid any discussion, remove postings and contributions or cry and complain behind the back, get people blocked and start blaming them by speaking and spreading all sorts of lies.

The next time you want to speak about somone abusing, pl. recall with all vigour in what manner you retorted to Mahawiki - you told him first not to """"soil"""" your talk page (what language and choice of words!!! and then you told him to go get the book by S.Kamat from a good library because you said such a library exists near your home..... if those are not insults, abusive manner of speaking, then what is.... but poor you, when I asked you to go and read Ancient India by either Roychowdhury or Sastri, you start looking out of the balcony!!!!!!

tsk tsk..

  

 Who is a vandal, Mr.Dinesh Kannambadi 

Do not accuse others of being vandals.  Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.

Now whom should the question be asked: whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas, when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 1160/65 and finally demised in 1189/1192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD?. This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page because even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were consumed and finally eclipsed by their local rivals in Kannada country as well as by the Kakatiyas.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas, when it was the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them? Is it some sort of a new version of history that is being sought to be told and spread to unsuspecting visitors to these pages?

 African Americans are multiracials 
Countless studies and research have shown that African Americans aren't pure blacks, like you would find in Africa, but multiracials. They have Native American and Caucasoid in their ancestry, from being raped and what have you. Technically speaking, they are a completely separate race from """"Black people"""", as they aren't pure blacks. The only reason they're often categorized as such is because of the One-Drop rule. Shouldn't this fact be noted in the heading of the article. At least something about them being multiracials as opposed to pure blacks? 66.175.204.183    —Preceding unsigned comment added by 66.175.200.14   

That's because """"race"""" varies over a fairly smooth space of variable phenotypes and two races are described as different when there is a discontinuity.  That is to say, before civilized times, one was not really able to tell the difference between one's neighbors, and one was rather unlikely to encounter people who looked substantially different until more modern and effective means of transportation and higher population densities allowed for it.  Your views on racial mixing """"creating a new race"""" is bizarre, since it takes race to be an immutable and discrete classification system.  This is the same kind of fallacy that leads one to ask for the """"missing link"""" for evolution.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.7.82.22   

What do you mean by all that bombastic rigmarole?! I am stating a very simple truth, which is that African Americans are a mixed race because we have Caucasoid, Native American, and Negroid in us. People might wonder to themselves how can Tisha Campbell be black or Negroid when she doesn't look black by any stretch of the imagination. The answer is simple: because she's African American and skin colors range all across the board in the African American community. I have several people in my family who are the color of Tisha Campbell and that's because African Americans are NOT Negroids. We're multiracials. Research has been done proving this; not to mention, I have proof within my family tree. 66.175.201.77  """,0

 The McIntosh et al. 2013 study on rotational acceleration and bicycle helmets 

I have restored the reference to this study in the """"Rotational Injury"""" section of the article - someone had removed it and substituted a reference to a another study by McIntosh et al. which deals only with motorcycle helmets. Unfortunately, it seems the publisher has made a mistake and the McIntosh et al. paper and one other paper are missing from the online journal contents (you can see the gap in the page numbers for that issue). The corresponding author is endeavouring to have that corrected, but the paper does exist, I have seen a copy of it. It isn't indexed in PubMed yet either.  In the meantime, I will post of a copy of the abstract from the paper here:
ANDREW S. MCINTOSH, ADRIAN LAI and EDGAR SCHILTER. Bicycle Helmets: Head Impact Dynamics in Helmeted and Unhelmeted Oblique Impact Tests. Traffic Injury Prevention (2013) 14, 501–508. online DOI: 10.1080/15389588.2012.727217. 
Objective: To assess the factors, including helmet use, that contribute to head linear and angular acceleration in bicycle crash simulation tests.
Method: A series of laboratory tests was undertaken using an oblique impact rig. The impact rig included a drop assembly with a Hybrid III head and neck. The head struck a horizontally moving striker plate. Head linear and angular acceleration and striker plate force were measured. The Head Injury Criterion was derived. The following test parameters were varied: drop height to a maximum of 1.5 m, horizontal speed to a maximum of 25 km/h, helmet/no helmet, impact orientation/location, and restraint adjustment. Additional radial impacts were conducted on the same helmet models for comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics were derived and multiple regression was applied to examine the role of each parameter. 
Results: Helmet use was the most significant factor in reducing the magnitude of all outcome variables. Linear acceleration and the Head Injury Criterion were influenced by the drop height, whereas angular acceleration tended to be influenced by the horizontal speed and impact orientation/location. The restraint adjustment influenced the outcome variables, with lower coefficients of variation observed with the tight restraint. 
Conclusions: The study reinforces the benefits of wearing a bicycle helmet in a crash. The study also demonstrates that helmets do not increase angular head acceleration. The study assists in establishing the need for an agreed-upon international oblique helmet test as well as the boundary conditions for oblique helmet testing.

= My Famous Article ==witze  happiness − wikipedia The Witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families, regardless of race, age, character or knowledge. The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.

The Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.

                           History
The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.

                       Proper History
As early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.",0

Ethnic Malays
This edit war is getting a little tiring. You added a lot of references to support your claim """"and to some degree Javanese culture; however it differs by being more overtly Islamic than the Javanese culture"""". Yes, it is true they are similar to """"some degree"""". But you could also say that Malays are similar to """"some degree"""" with many other Austronesian cultures, of which there are thousands. If you look at the language classification  the Malay language and Javanese have over 1000 languages in the same language group. Out of those, the Malay language is in fact closer to many other languages such as Ibanic, Kendayan, Balinese, Madurese & Sundanese than it is to Javanese. So why have you mentioned Javanese specifically and not one of those other 1000 cultures, especially those which are more closely linked to Malay culture? You can of course find elements of one culture which have been adopted by another culture, but does that make them similar enough to mention? Its like saying American and Japanese culture is similar since they both like to play baseball. You could just as correctly say that Malays and Thais are similar """"to some degree"""". The second part of the claim """"however it differs by being more overtly Islamic than the Javanese culture"""" is wrong since it implies that religion is the only, or even the main differentiating factor. This is total nonsense.

The other part of the article you keep reverting about Malays being present in Southern Myanmar is wrong, and I suggest you do some research to find out which languages are spoken in Southern Myanmar to find out why. (  )""",0

""" Bad crap ==

What bunch of crazies wanted connection to the Force to be mystical instead of genetic? Movies like these shouldn't be mystical! It's about the happenings in a fictional galaxy, not some weird spiritual garbage! The only time it should be spiritual is if it were referencing Christianity, and referencing it correctly at that!  01:48, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I, for one, am an atheist and don't believe in all that spiritual crap myself. However, I think that mysticism in stories makes them much, well… better. It also enhances the theme.   02:24, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

How does it do that?  15:26, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Scorpionman, what makes you think that a movie should only be spiritual if it references Christianity and not another religion? —  দ 07:34, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I suppose that depends on your point of view. I'm not relativistic, but when it comes to things like science fiction, there's no need for spiritual stuff.  15:26, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

In fact, I was disappointed when I learned that the Jedi use some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically. It would make more sense for me if they were just highly-trained concentrated people. -  14:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The Jedi don't really use the midi-clorians. The midi-clorians just connect them to the Force, and the Force is what the Jedi use.   23:04, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)
By """"some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically"""" I mean the Force. I'm quite disappointed by its very existence in Star Wars. -  06:46, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I don't really think it needs to reference ANY religion. Science fiction is science fiction! If you think it needs to reference Islam, that's your opinion.  03:30, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I don't think he ever mentioned Islam.   00:14, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)

I am not sure to whom the anonymous editor was referring (I don't see any reference to Islam either), and I suppose this discussion isn't really relevant here anyway. But for the record, I have no problem with spirituality without reference to a specific or already-existing religion, especially in something like Star Wars where the connection of the """"humans"""" to us is obscure (since it takes place during ancient times in a distant galaxy). I was responding to Scorpionman's odd (in my opinion) comment that movies should only be spiritual if they reference Christianity instead of other religions. I personally think it's better to stay away from specific religions. —  দ 02:00, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I really would rather have it not reference spirituality, but my """"weird comment"""" stating that it should only reference Christianity is my point of view. I know not everybody agrees, but I really would rather it all be purely technological and scientific.  01:55, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The Force is a power that can not easily be conceived, my young padawan. We must learn to harness its energies, let it flow through us. Only then can we become one with the Force.   02:13, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)

 Since I actually created the Earp Vendetta Ride page 
In Jan 2006 (which Lastexit edited within 3 mo), I was amused an awed by your clever synthesis, but there's something you missed. Earp was a gentile who married a Jew. Mantanmoreland claims to be a gentile with some Jewish blood, and an admitted fascination with antisemetism (and of course India). I suggested on the TALK page that the easiest explanation of the Mantanmoreland fascination with Weiss, followed by their joint trip to India to the same odd village, where Weiss went to marry, is that Mantanmoreland is simply the person Weiss went to India to marry. That person's an economics geek from the East coast, who now lives with Weiss and has always editted on his time schedule. Duh. My comments were not only deleted, but my conclusions were labeled """"silly."""" They may be wrong, but I fail to see why they are """"silly."""" No evidence has been presented for Mantanmoreland being Weiss which isn't explained just as well (even better) by his biggest fan (Mantanmoreland) being more than a fan (but less than a sock). Anyway, thanks for the essay. Dunno why your ideas are allowed to survive on the evidence page, names and all, but mine are not even allowed on the TALK page. Sheesh.  """,0

"I understand your point, but this isn't a local anomaly. We're talking about the cut and dry first cotton mill in America. If this was the first Ma and Pop's Hoagie shop, well then yes that would be in a local context, but this is a national to international matter of relevance. This is not a regional interest topic. The BCM is extremely notable and worth mentioning in this article. If you want to subdivide the article into pieces based on regionality, then let's create a Cotton Mills in America article and put the BCM at the top of the list.

As far as Slater's history is concerned, there was a progression between animal and water powered production. I don't have the information on any other animal powered production facilities, but you mention that you found two or three references to animal power in 1400. Why not add them? They're part of history. Perhaps the framework of your date titling system in Cotton Mill is rubbish and needs to be changed, because no matter what stance we take here, the article is clearly missing information that could be incorporated. Providing only the information there allows people to make incorrect inferences.

In the context of Cotton Mill, are we to add an animal-powered category, or are we going to omit that from history? The Water powered section is nice, but we should show a greater view of earlier mills, both in America and across the seas. Don't hold back now, you appear to have more information about other mills. Add that information, please!",0

Re """"How did you hear about this?"""": My main day-to-day work on WP is gnome-work, cleaning up citation syntax errors. About half of the subcategories of CS1 citation errors have been completely cleared out, so I have a report that shows me articles newly added to the subcategories. Most articles show up in those subcategories because of additions to an article.

Be careful with that editor

KDesk,
I appreciate your perception that the image of a man smoking a joint (which Mjpresson says exemplifies the title of the article Cannabis smoking) is inappropriate.  You may wish to follow the controversy further on Talk:Cannabis smoking, on the """"discussion"""" page of Wikipedia:WikiProject cannabis, and at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents/Tokerdesigner banned for one week where User:Tokerdesigner is under consideration for a block because User:Mjpresson proposed the block starting with a false allegation that Tokerdesigner """"threatened"""" Mjpresson.  

At the latter site you may decide to join in and vote to oppose a one-week block against Tokerdesigner especially after going to Mjpresson:Contributions and seeing what that editor has started to do on cannabis-related articles and One-hitter (smoking), seemingly emboldened by the thought that with Tokerdesigner sanctioned, other editors will be intimidated and uneager to try to stop him/her.

"Timeline Links 

Hi Minderbinder,

I am new to posting on wikipedia, and you recently deleted all of my links that I have added.  I have read the links you posted in my talk section, and appreciate your concern and commitment to keeping the external links on wikipedia relevant and non-commercial. I support you in that effort.

However, you mistakely assumed I am associated commericially with OurStory, which I am not.  Additionally, none of the links I posted attempt to earn me any money.  The timelines I manage are freely open to the public to browse and reference.  

I am a biographer by hobby, and am using the OurStory service beacuse I like the timeline they provide.  It is a service that I couldn't find else where on the web, and as a history buff and biographer, I think it is valuable.  I run a number of profiles on their service, which are told collaboratively with other people on the site, and I particpate in other people's biographical projects.

I do respect the fact that external links should provide information that positively adds to the discussion, or provides valuable information that is not already in the entry.  And I understand that in some cases the information on my timeline projects does this and sometimes it does not.  So, in respecting this, I will only add my links back to entries where I think my timeline provides valuable (or missing) information on that subject, for the wikipedia user. You can see my comments on those individual discussion pages.

But, as a final thought, I hope that you can appreciate that, in and of itself, a biographical (graphical) timeline is a useful external reference tool.  It is something I have been looking for for a long time.  For example, when I created my biography on Barack Obama, in my research I could not find a biographical web source that provided dates for important events that make up his life (including the wikipedia entry, offical Illinois sentate, or US Sentate biographies, or even his current campaign page).  There was nowhere I could go to get a sense of the major events in his life, without reading 3 pages of text.  So, in a case like that, I think the timeline is an external reference that is contributing to the entry.

If you think it is best, I can alter the way I leave links, so that it does not say Our Story in it.  I just followed the example that is widely used on wikipedia for external links to IMDB.

If you would like to further the general discussion, please post on my Talk page again.  And, please engage me on the discussion page for the individual entries where I am adding the links back.  If you plan on re-deleting them, please review the timeline first, and provide a reason why you feel it is not worthy of being listed.

Thank you!",0

The cause has not yet been identified but it is believed to have been started by a faulty heater. The fire broke out at around 4am and firefighters from around the area were called to battle the flames. The fire was not completely put out until about 12pm. It is not yet known whether the building will be demolished and rebuilt. Netto is famously associated with good value but there is a definite negative connotation linked to the supermarket chain associated with cheapness, being mainly a food shop for the lower working class. It is becoming very popular with schoolchildren who often claim that a fellow classmate shops there, as to insult the receiver (due to Netto being known for its cheapness). 

My view is that it is unescessary information and the negative connotation section is an indirect attack at Netto.  I personally have never got that impression myself or heard those connotations and they do not need to be in this article surely?   The schoolchild quote is again not needed in the article.

On the term Azeri

See that section of my full article on this.  Overall, the formation of Azerbaijani-Turkish ethnic group is from the 13th-16th century.  But the USSR usage of Azerbaijani was not clear.  The ethnonym """"Azerbaijani"""" though is very recently and dates back to the early 20th or late 19th century.  In some sources, """"Azerbaijani"""" is used to refef to any modern inhabitant of the republic while """"Azeri"""" is the ethnic term meaning Azeri-Turk  

As noted by Oliver Roy:
“The concept of Azeri identity barely appears at all before 1920.  Up until that point Azerbaijan had been a purely geographical area.  Before 1924, the Russians called Azeri Tatars """"Turk"""" or """"Muslims"""".(Roy, Oliver. “The new Central Asia: The Creation of Nations”). 

According to Prof. Tadeusz Swietochovski: """"Azerbaijani"""" was coined in the 1930s to refer to the inhabitants of the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.(Azerbaijan Seven Years of Conflict Nagorno-Karabagh – Human Rights Watch / Helsinki– December 1994 by Human Rights Watch).

So a historical article should not have anachronistic terms.

According to the multi-volume book “History of the East” (“Transcaucasia in XI-XV centuries” in Rostislav Borisovich Rybakov (editor), History of the East. 6 volumes.  v. 2. “East during the Middle Ages: Chapter V., 2002. – ISBN 5-02-017711-3.  http://gumilevica.kulichki.com/HE2/he2510.htm )

What did the USSR mean by Azerbaijani?

Since the ethnonym Azerbaijani for an ethnic group was new, the USSR era did not provide a clear definition.  For example some considered Azerbaijanis to be Medes, others as Turks and others as Caucasian Albanians.  Then there was theories combining some or all of these.  This is another reason why calling Nezami Ganjavi as “Azerbaijani” in the politicized USSR sources lacks clarity.  Do they mean Medes(and the descendant of Iranic Medes like Talysh, Kurds?), or Caucasian Albanians or Turks and etc.

For  example  Bolukbashi mentions(Susha Bolukbashi,  ‘Nation building in Azerbaijan: The Soviet Legacy and the Impact of the Karabakh Conflict’ in Van Schendel, Willem(Editor) .

"""Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.

One last thing to keep as a motto: """"It's better to write one good, well-referenced, nicely-presented article than it is to create fifty unreferenced one-line stubs!""""  (talk …stalk!) 
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | page = 125
 | isbn = 0-521-37169-4
}}


Please see user:chzz/demo/citeref to see the result.

 A hint 

Here's a hint. If your textbooks in grade schools didn't claim Israel doesn't have a right to exist, if parents in your society weren't teaching their kids that blowing up my people is a wonderful thing that will get them 72 virgins, if your government didn't name streets after mass murderers, pay blood money to the parents of mass murderers, put them on camera hailing their kids as heroes, and if YOUR PEOPLE weren't spending their time and money on buying weapons and digging smuggling tunnels instead of fixing infrastructure, starting businesses, and building better lives, then there would be no need for checkpoints, no need for a big-ass wall, no need for anything of the sort. And you'd have your state. You'd have had it decades ago if your goal was to have a state.

You could have been living freely, if the Arab states had accepted the offer, signed a nonagression pact, and let you come home instead of stuffing your parents inside """"refugee camps"""" cynically turning you into shock troops and poster children for """"oh look what the Jews did to 'our people' when we stuffed them into refugee camps instead of taking the easy way to let them go home.""""

You could have had a Palestinian state in 1948. You could have had one at any time after that.

But it's as you say. """"On the last day, even the rocks and the trees will shout 'O Muslim, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him!""""

Your goal isn't a Palestinian state. It's the death of my people and establishing a sharia state on top of their cooling bodies.

 Binky, grow up. All you want is to be obstructive and destructive of real info included on WP - you're solidly outed. You might as well admit it. At least to yourself. Over here you write: """"You know, I like your Strauss-Kahn addition, using good sourcing, but this bit about bootlegs is your weak area. You need to find a source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs"""": that being so, why don't you do it yourself, and thus help additions those less skillful at manipulating WP than you, try to contribute? Instead of actively deleting and obstructing the info being included, under increasingly fanciful pretexts (incidentally, """"source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs"""" is easily found on Youtube and elsewhere, e.g. http://www.freetimeweb.nl/home/muziek/ccr/johnfogerty_bootleg.html (I'm sure even you can google """"Fogerty bootleg"""", though actually I didn't add that info - I only supplied the ref, before you deleted it all). But you deleted it or had it deleted, instead of supporting it with adjustments, as you could've done, improving instead of obstructing - how's that for an idea?). You appear to be an amateur psychopat, taking out your failed real life on innocents on WP. You a-soul. Be a good person. Instead of being destructive and obstructive, be constructive. If you know how - if not, try to learn. Even a miserable psychopat like you can turn around. Try. - Plus, incidentally, I haven't been edit-warring but reverting your edit-warring and vandalism (check history if you suddenly don't recall - but your memory is tendentially selective, I'm sure, recalling only that which supports your lies, right?). I'm no expert at WP and have no time to become one - I only wanted to contribute, not to get embroiled with an apparent psychopat like you. Plus re new IPs: if frequent power-outages happen to change my IP, don't flatter yourself that it's in response to your unacceptable behaviour: you're not on par with hurricane Nina. At all. You're merely a small gust temporarily confusing, but achieving nothing - except making people tire of you. You really are a tiresome fogey, as demonstrated when you write and admit: """"despite the truth of what you were inserting"""". Well, that truth being so, why don't you help fix it, instead of hounding away the contributor? But you apparently don't think facts should have primacy on WP, rather your quarrelling should, right? - I'm no expert on the rules you misuse, and won't waste time to become one - as I have a real life. I merely contribute where I can, as an attitude to life. Try it. You might like it. Actually -). Instead of perfecting being an apparent grumpy old man and failed psychopat, scouring WP for victims. You won, because I'm not interested in your fight. Now you've successfully excluded good info from WP, info which even you concede is """"the truth"""". That's a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one. Hope this little letter changes you for the better, because that's truly needed.

Did you hear this with relation to an Euclidean topology or some other naturally occuring topology? It cannot be redundant in general since if we take a non-empty set X and choose a non-empty proper subset U of X, then the """"topology"""" on X consisting only of U would satisfy the two axioms you stated but would not contain X nor the empty set. Of course, this is a trivial example. 
Suppose we call a collection of subsets of a set X a """"relevant topology"""" (this is not a real name; just something I made up just now so it is easier to talk about these things) if it satisfies every axiom except possibly that """"X and the empty set are in the topology"""". Then a non-empty set with a """"relevant topology"""" that is Hausdorff (here """"Hausdorff"""" means that any two distinct points are separated by neighborhoods; the same definition as the usual one on topological spaces) would necessarily have to include the empty set in the """"topology"""". Thus for """"many"""" topological spaces, requiring the empty set to be open is indeed redundant. 
On the other hand, the requirement that the whole set X be open is in general not redundant with fairly natural topologies (I suppose). For example, take any topological space X and let Y be a set containing X as a proper subset. Declare a subset of Y to be open if and only if it is in the topology on X. Then this """"relevant topology"""" on Y satisfies every axiom that a topological space should satisfy except that Y itself is not open. For example, X could be some Euclidean space with the standard topology (and Y could be any set containing X as a proper subset). But this construction is probably not very interesting since (at least as far as I can see) there is not any new information or insight obtained.
This might be too elementary for you, but I wrote the following section in open set a while back that roughly describes why the axioms are the way they are and the motivation for the abstract formulation of a topology: Open_set#Motivation. The following discussion at MathOverflow may perhaps be more appropriate to your question: Do the empty set and the entire set really need to be open?. T """,0

Many Christians and fundamentalists believe that it is their duty as part of their mission to bring Christianity to all non-believers. Whether the effects are positive or not, proselytizing is not hostility per se. The key ingredient is in the intention of the person doing it.

If it was always called Olzstyn in Polish, I stand corrected. I was perhaps confusing it with Ketrzyn, formerly Ranstenburg. (Is this a transliteration into Polish of Allenstein, as Frombork is a transliteration of Frauenburg?)

However, before 1945  the town was known to non-Poles as Allenstein, as a glance at any contemporary travel guide will attest. Witness also the League of Nations plebiscite in southern East Prussia, which as shorthand was referred to as """"the Allenstein district"""" (Cf. Churchill's memoirs). The plebiscite there in 1920 produced 97.8 percent (362,209 votes) for Germany and 2.2 percent (7,980 votes) for Poland.10  These are facts, widely reported at the time and cited in countless historical accounts since then.

There are two different things going on in this article: one is a hypothetical discussion of what a North American currency union might look like, based on descriptions in obscure white papers from think tanks and science fiction books. The other is the origin and debunking of the conspiracy theory that such a union actually is being planned by some sort of powerful forces. The two have little to do with each other, for one. Additionally, by keeping the two in one article, the citations for the first look like evidence for the latterwhich they are not, and which some of the people who provide them probably do not want them used as. The first article should be the place for discussing serious economic and futurologist viewpoints about what an NACU might be; the second should be devoted largely to a sociological analysis of why people believe in the conspiracy theorynot to details of the theory itself, as that lends undue weight to the idea that said theory is true.

Dear Vrenator!
Nice to meet you. 

Yes, I do believe that you made an error removing my edit on the Jostein Gaarder page, having assumed that it was not constructive. 
However, I appreciate that you are open for a civil discussion, which is not as frequent nowadays as it should be. So, let's go (on my side not in native English, and I ask for your patience if the same could be said briefer).

Your first impression could have been that my adding the word """"controversial"""" after the """"and"""" in the subtitle """"Environmental and human rights activism"""" can be bias, as certain Wikipedia guidelines generally suggest about this word. Generally it may be true, but not if, as in this case, the paragraph itself factually speaks about the """"Gaarder controversy"""", and it opens to a whole session about that controversy.

Just the other way around; actually the existing title was a bias: because all the Journalistic Ethics Guidelines I've ever seen, state that titles should express more or less what is written within the article, and can't say the opposite.(Which, unfortunately, is a not unfrequently used way of bias; utilizing that much more people read the title than the whole paragraph, and the title remains in the minds, while the truth-qualifying statement somewhere inside the article runs unnoticed). 
How can the title be simply about his """"human rights activism"""" when there is a controversion mentioned in the article about his hate-speech against a whole nation and a religion? 
I don't suggest that the Wikipedia article condemn Jostein Gaarder, as I learned and think now he has fully deserved, but 'controversial' his human rights activity certainly is.  

Therefore I firmly believe that you should revert my edit: 
I added in the title the word """"controversial"""", as the paragraph itself proves it expressedly, in order to make it: """"Environmental and controversial human rights activism"""". Also, for balance, besides Gaarder's own views of his own op-ed, I added at the end, how some others see the case: 'But some others see this op-ed as an expressedly anti-Semitic document'"""" 

Bthw, about the whole Gaarder controversy subject in this Wikipedia article it feels strongly that the Gaarder side - for which it is a central issue - dented it rather succesfully as if almost only the Norwegian Jews found his op-ed """"offending the Jews and Judaism"""". In fact several serious works of others (see later) also condemned Gaarder's op-ed as terrible hate-speech.

At least one more change - addition - is required: where the  """"Gaarder controversy"""" session writes about """"others"""", it asks in blue [Who?] and I wanted to add there the best source I know (The Augean Stables website), but it seemed as if I was blocked to do so. 

So, if, as I suppose, you are sincerely interested to learn about the controversy, read: 'Open Letter to Jostein Gaarder: Fisking Crypto-Supersessionism' on http://www.theaugeanstables.com/multiple-part-essays/open-letter-to-jostein-gaarder-fisking-crypto-supersessionism/ .
This is a scholarly answer to Gaarder's every statement by an American historian, and it gives every chance to Gaarder to correct himself in a respectful way. What Gaarder has never done,he only said some vague self-justifications like 'it was written in a haste' and 'should have been worded more cautiously"""" - as if these could justify vehement hate speech by an authority.

As a summary, my edit is a very mild correction only to Wikipedia's Jostein Gaarder article, relative to the hate-speech he committed against a whole people and a religion, and has never corrected.       (P.s.: It can be more convenient to use e-mail - I willingly give you my address any way you suggest to do this. )
Sincerely Yours,

"Proof the FBI lied in their Reports 

In 1966, author and attorney Mark Lane ( Rush to Judgment, Plausible Denial, Last Word ) interviewed witnesses to the assassination who had not been called to testify before the Warren Commission. In those interviews, the witnesses described to Lane what they saw and told him that they told the exact same thing to the authorities who questioned them immediately after the assassination.

But the FBI record, told in reports and Warren Commission Exhibits and documents, tell a different story, one in which the witnesses never saw anything.

In this video, I take the interviews of the witnesses and compare them to the reports of the authorities in order to prove that the reports were indeed fabricated.

To Paul B or whomever has taken the responsibility for editting this work. While I admire your dedication to upholding a neutral point of view in this article.

I think that that would be the only way to present a truly fair and neutral portrayal of Max Muller. One other consideration for yourself would be what is you consider a mainstream opinion, because I am sure that you are aware of the politics that goes into getting a paper published and the biases that can play for or against it. Finally, your vehement refutation of other sources based on """"who is he?"""" shows your own inability to question and research into ideas contradictory to others. I would recommend that if you are going to portay a neutral article, please do so by giving both sides of the story.

Gibraltar self-government

Dear Justin, I can't understand why you delete my edits on the Gibraltar article and then post the following comment in my page: """"You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war according to the reverts you have made on Gibraltar."""" I have not intended to start an edit war, just eliminated a reference that seems controversial and was not supported by any reference (1) and repositioned some uncontroverted facts (2):

1) The article began with the expression """"Gibraltar (...) is a self-governing British overseas territory (...)"""". This was not supported by any objective reference in the article and, in fact, it is something not endorsed by the UN (see below), which at least provides some ground for not accepting the self-government of Gibraltar as a self-evident fact. Therefore, I substituted it for some referenced facts.

2) The article referenced the fact that Gibraltar is on the UN's non self-governing territories list but British and Gibraltarian polititians think that it should be removed. Only it was lost somewhere in the middle of this (long) article. I repositioned this information to the introduction of the article where it summarises the territory's political nature. It does not matter if 50 years ago it was the UK who nominated Gibraltar for the list: this status is reviewed every year and has not yet been reverted by UN's Special Committee.

What surprises me is: I would have expected that if you disagree with my edits, you would discuss them or, if you think they do not offer a holistic view, you complete them with additional referenced facts. Instead of that, you just deleted the edits and accused me of edit warring.

I will appreciate your discussing the changes and contributing with additional insight and referenced facts. Please do not merely undo my edits.

Kind regards.  

If you want to discuss this the appropriate place is the talk page of the article, not here as this is not a matter between you and justin.  The reality is that since the 2006 constitution Gibraltar is manifestly self governing, sadly progress on delisting it by the UN C24 is hampered by Spain's foolish attitude and intransigence.  It is amusing that that committee is comprised of representatives of states with less democracy than Gibraltar and if you follow the proceedings they have been singularly useless in achieving anything in relation to their remit on ANY territory such that the GoG declined to attend further meetings.  In relation to the politics of Gibralar, which is what the article is about, the UN is irrelevent - indeed the committee has not even visited the territory in question despite being invited to do so by the GoG and the UK. They are not so much a paper tiger as a limp piece of used bog roll.   

Please do not insult my intelligence that your intentions were anything other than to push a POV with that edit.  The facts remain that Gibraltar is self-governing.  It is only Spain that for its own political agenda denies this and the UN C24 is discussed in the article.  Your POV edit sought to give those facts WP:UNDUE prominence.  Your behaviour was also to edit war to keep that edit, hence my warning was appropriate.  And as Gibnews points out the correct place for that discussion was the article talk page. '''' talk """,0
