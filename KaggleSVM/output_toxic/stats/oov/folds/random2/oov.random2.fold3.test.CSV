 Abusive harrassment of blocked editor 

These related edits on Malik's talk page are inappropriate period, and right after he's been blocked are a violation of our policy against """"dancing on another user's grave"""".  I reverted them.  I could block you, it's the standard thing to do when people abuse blocked editors like that, but I would much prefer you just not edit Malik's talk page again.

Thank you.   
Admins stick together. Never talk back. I get it.  Lots of shit. 
You might notice the TB above inviting me to respond to his """"shitty"""" message. The Dissident Aggressor 

I think you will find the grave dancing is found distasteful around here regardless of who is being mocked. Chillum 
In that case, I'll revert to the comments I made before I noticed he was blocked. The Dissident Aggressor 

You actually reverted to the most insulting version. You're blocked.

   
DissidentAggressor, yes, I'm an admin too, and I'm sticking with Malik not because he's an admin but because he's a great guy and without him, this project would be worse off. So you were on the wrong side of some debate with himwell, it happens. (Sorry, but Malik was correct in his reading of """"Selected discography"""".) Now you said some shit, and you caught Malik at a bad moment (and the rest of the admin corps), and you said some more shit, and now you're blocked for gravedancing. My advice to you: think about the situation in which all this happened, find the appropriate way to take back what you shouldn't have said, and get back to editing. I've seen you before, I'd like to have you as an editor more than as a former editor, so please take me seriously. And next timebut I'm sure there won't be a next timeyou fall into a situation like this, take a deep breath. Ping me here if you have any questions.   """,0

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

I think that one of the confounding issues is what to name what Einstein called """"spooky action at a distance."""" The idea of action involves the application of some force over some amount of time, and our ordinary idea of """"causing something"""" involves exerting force on some system to influence its behavior. But entanglement is exhibited without the lag that would be required were interactions at a velocity ≤ c, so something is going on that is not """"causal"""" in the usual sense. On the other hand, before one or the other entangled twin particles is measured, they both have the freedom or the potential to manifest either spin, and after one of them is measured and must manifest a spin then the other no longer has the freedom or potential to manifest any spin other than the opposite of the one that was first measured. So something has changed, and it strikes me as creating an intellectual smokescreen to say that there is only some kind of abstract """"correlation"""" involved. Like the """"collapse"""" of a wavefunction, we have no idea of what is going on or how to describe it. All we know is that it happens. It also strikes me as possibly significant that the time sequence may not be clear. From my frame of reference, electron A is observed first, and electron B is observed second. Someone else, in another frame of reference, may see electron B as being observed first and electron A as being observed second. There are also phenomena within the same frame of reference that we call retrocausal. We have no way of knowing that the discovery of the polarity of photon B at time T+n determines, retrocausally, the polarity of photon A at time T. If we say that these changes are not local, that must  (I think) mean that they are not local in space-time. So, in a sense, I end up arguing against my own discomfort with the idea that there is """"only"""" a correlation between the discovered states of any entangled twins.

 Morphology 

I think that a few words should be written about endings of various kinds, and of distinctions of cases.  There seems to be some misunderstandings here and there in the project, with claims that """"German has preserved the proto-germanic grammar"""" or similarly.  This is not 100% true (although German certainly has preserved much of the grammar).  I therefore think that mentioning the instrumental case, and the fact that there were more different endings in OHG than in modern High German is interesting enough to merit a section.  I do not think we should try to reproduce all paradigms; but some representative sample.  (However, I just know them from rather old books; and these books do not very carefully distinguish different epochs or dialects within the OHG.)
I had in mind an example like this:

    Sing.    Pl. N    tag    taga G    tages    tago D    tage    tagum A    tag    taga I    tagu    (not distinguishable)

and a few words on how e.g. 1:st and 3:rd p. pl. of the verbs then were quite distinct (in pres. ind. normally ending in -mes and -nt, and in pret. -m and -n, respectively); where in the modern language a final -m is replaced by an -n, making the forms indistinguishable.  Is this sensible?  """,0

 No problems then, and candor I have in spades. People around here from Jimbo on down definitely know when I have a peeve, though these days, seems like most I knew well have quit. Loosing people like CBD, Mel Etitis, and David Kernow I really have to chalk up to the endless strife and hostility of these episodic outbreaks of someone creating a dislocating change... Deletions of something just created, qualify for that, if you'll allow the personal reference. I don't hold grudges, as many can tell you, so I'm taking you at your candorous word too!

 Admittedly, the sweetness and light bit gets cloying all the time, so putting some mustard on things is actually compensation for the the otherwise thankless efforts, now and again.

Shaking preconceptions in those that forget WP:IAR is perhaps the best legacy I sometimes think I can give around here... particularly the young folks don't have enough life experience to know when to live and let live and so ignore a rule or guideline... 

This silly series I'm working is a case in point. Ill served by it when I checked our coverage when I stumbled across it in November, I'm compulsed as I have been in many areas here to try improving it, mainly by adding to it, for it was cut by a harsh, ill-judged ruthless person. The original writers went on to other tasks in life's stages, so a nicely put together set of articles covering the series got run over by the mac truck of one guy, aided passively by 2-3 others, pushing the new notability rules so they wiped out hundreds of man-hours of work, in some nifty and salvageable articles. Turned them into around 180 redirects and put together a paltry in-universe list article that had almost zero value... leaving things well enough alone would have been far better. Kidz!!! Sigh.

You're right Milo.  A consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology.  Only that. Wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field. We don't ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star.  We really don't care what they have to say.  And of course, we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology, and more so than with other articles on science.  I have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say.

Even if I were pushing parapsychology, I still would not try to censor the critics, because that would only detract from my case- the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash.

 Vandalizing 

At first I wasn't even aware that the order of the first three bouts on the mobile version of the website was different from the official version. I found out through him sending me an image of the official website. Since it was only an image, I checked the website just in case and was shocked to find out that that was indeed the order that they had on there. I did not and still do not have any proof that the mobile version of the website is """"outdated"""" as he stated. When I made the edits (prior to my knowledge of mobile being different from the official website) I chose to not change or add a reference because When I clicked on the already present website reference, it automatically took me to the mobile version, being that I was using my mobile device to make the edits. Due to prior research of the fighters involved in the first three bouts and common knowledge of the sport, all common sense and logic led to me believing (like I always did) that the order of the bouts on the mobile version was the correct one. As soon as I found out the mobile version and official version were different I re-edited the page to rearrange the bouts to the most logical order and changed the prior reference from the official site to the mobile. I was never aware that you guys didn't accept mobile versions of websites with more logical information as references until I read his complaint and your response. I apologize if I caused any inconvenience or misunderstanding on your website. My main intentions were to help improve and accurate the content on the page based on my knowledge and common sense.

 ******* Double Standard Against Bosniaks *********** 

ChrisO doesn't want me to use copy of the original investigative article that was published in 1993 by David Bernstein (Pacific News Service). The reason is because he thinks this is a personal website http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html . What difference does it make? It's still original article published 13 years ago by Pacific News Service with full copyright notice? http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html

On the other hand - he allows use of personal """"lists"""" or """"groups"""", such as """"mail-archive"""" and Serb-run """"balkanpeace"""" from Toronto when reading articles republished from Canada's Globe and Mail, example http://www.mail-archive.com/serbian_way@antic.org/msg00008.html

Anyways, balkanpeace.org is Serb-run website in which Bosniaks, Croats and other ethnic groups are portrayed as the worst of the worst, while Serb crimes are excused.

One more thing - if I stop being active here, then you will know that they banned me. And if that happens, it will be clear example of pro-Serb one-sidedness and double-standard that is attempting to plague this very important article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre .

I urge ChrisO to protect Srebrenica Massacre article in a same way Israel's article is protected http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel .

And remember: Srebrenica massacre article is not about Serbs or pro-Serb lobbyists such as General Lewis Mackenzie. Srebrenica massacre article is about 8,000+ victims of genocide. Let's focus on the victims and honor them.

How would you feel if you lost your children, mother, grandmother, grandfather and all people that you loved and lived for? Ask yourself this question every time you edit Srebrenica massacre article. Search for love and compassion in your heart, you will find it.

Furthermore there are writings of other people in my books and there are photocopies of important documents like letters from Cap Weinberger on DOD stationary, letter from Bootsie Galbraith wife of US Ambassador to France at the time on official stationary, documents from the late CIA Chief of Station Harold Chipman - who BTW was the model for and wrote some of the episodes for the TV Series """"The Enforcer"""". Also Author House is quite cheap for what they do. The publishing costs are inconsequential. They do not at all fit the above description in my experience.

Take some time to look at other youth orchestra entries in Wikipedia. 
List of youth orchestras in the United States
Look at some that have clean up notices on them and look at some of the better ones. If you do this you will be better able to judge the content. 

You may use published sources that are not on-line. So long as they are reliable and ultimately verifiable by someone who would take the time to look them up to check the information.

Wikipedia has increased the need for Encyclopedic Value. Older articles that are not verifiable are being removed. The ones that have long standing clean up notices will either be rectified by interested parties or will ultimately be removed. Those notices serve to tell the public that the article does not meet the standards of reliability of an encyclopedic article. 

It appears that the Orchestra has been in existence for 50 plus years. It is not an emergency to get an article published. The heading ==Acclaim== jumps out as promotional. This is puffery and self aggrandizement. The article must be neutral in tone. The references or footnotes must back up statements in the article. for example use a statement such as - The orchestra has been well received by audiences in Country A and City B. Put in the references. the references themselves may be full of congratulatory language but avoid putting in the article. By way of illustration, if a news article from Country A said this is the greatest orchestra in the world and got a five minute standing ovation from the audience, you would use that as reference with regard to the aforementioned statement but would not put that directly in the article. If the article is in a venue brochure it is of little value but if it is in the Country A's leading newspaper then it is of value. Ask yourself, what would make this youth orchestra worthy of mention in an encyclopedia. That critical viewpoint will lead to a better article.",0

"The Sangharaj holds authority over all monks ordained in the Thai sangha, whether inside or outside of Thailand.  For example, it is through the Sangha council that monks are authorized to perform ordinations and through which the title of 'Somdet' is awarded.  However, the two monasteries you mention are slightly different from most Thai wats you find outside of Thailand.  Most Thai wats, for example here in San Francisco, are closely associated with the Sangha council which is heavily involved in the wat's operation.  (I think)

Amaravati and Abhayagiri pretty different because they are 'forest monasteries' and also because they are for Westerners.  Most forest monasteries tend to be fairly uninvolved with the formal Sangha administration, and doubly so the Westerners.  The various branches of Wat Nanachat tend to do their own thing, but still are bound by the Thai Sangha in certain ways.  For example, only Ajahns Sumedho and Pasanno are authorized by the Sangharaj to perform ordinations, so all ordinations within the branches of Wat Nanachat in the West are done by one of those two, whether here in America or in Australia, etc.",0

Echoing the statement above, with some more elucidation: there is no objective criteria under which the Telegraph is a more objective (or """"reputable"""") source than Counterpunch. The Telegraph was a part of the Hollinger International chain of newspapers, whose board of directors happened to include one Richard Perle  a known American conservative and supporter of the Israeli right-wing. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs is likewise a think tank and reliquary for Israeli right-wingers (retired military and diplomatic staff especially) and funded by convicted felon Michael Milken. It is not hard to see that a right-wing ideologue Weiner did a hit-piece on Edward Said using funds from a right-wing think tank, published it in a right wing journal (Commentary), that was picked up by a sympathetic newspaper (the Daily Telegraph).

Presenting either the Jerusalem Center or the Telegraph as """"objective"""" is an obvious distortion, that only owes itself to the right-wing media having warped the meaning of """"objective"""" and """"fair and balanced"""". The attack pieces on Edward Said have to be treated as just that - attack pieces, not scholarship. If we run them here, Said's supporters get a free shot to refute them as well.  """,0

"Introductory Paragraphs
The intro paragraphs are good, but they could be a lot better.  I think that right now there's too much of a technical sound to it, as opposed to something more educational and inviting to people trying to learn about the subject.  I'd just like you to compare/contrast with the following paragraph, which is how evolution is introduced in a Bio101 textbook:

(Fair use excerpts follows)
Evolution originated with Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species...He argued from evidence that the species of organisms inhabiting Earth today descended from ancestral species.  Second, he proposed a mechanism for evolution which he termed natural selection, the idea that organisms can change over the generations if individuals having certain heritable traits leave more offspring than other individuals.  ..In modern terms, we would say that the genetic composition of the population had changed over time, and that is one way of defining evolution.  But we can also use the termin evolution on a much grander scale to mean all of the biological history, from the earliest microbes to the enormous diversity of modern organisms.

An understanding of evolution informs every field of biology, and applications of evolutionary biology are transforming medicine, agriculture, biotechnology and conservation...Evolution integrates all of biology.
(above is for example purposes onlywe can't use this in the article.)

We can't use the above since it would be fair-use, but do you see what I mean about making the article more accessible?

Another thing I'd note about the above example is that it also makes Evolution sound more exciting.  Just because we are an encyclopedia doesn't mean we can't put the subject in the exciting, important context that it deserves.

We could use something closer to the above, and then dive into a description of how the Theory of Evolution (what you might call a description of the fact of evolution that's described above) has developed from Darwin's original theory to modern-day explanations (and at the same time state how the question of whether evolution occurs has been a relatively incontroversial fact amongst biologists for the better part of a century).",0

Nope.  The word """"hippie"""" was in use before it referred to the hippie subculture.  Read Hippie (etymology).  Unless you can find a secondary source showing that the Rolling Stones were using it to refer to the subculture, then you don't have a dispute.  We don't do original research.  The Fallon citation isn't sourced to Fallon: it's found in multiple sources that make that claim.  Take a look at the citation in the Hippie article: Perry 2005, p. 19; Sinclair, Mick. (2004) San Francisco: A Cultural and Literary History. Signal Books. p. 205. ISBN 1902669649; Singleton, Carl. Wildin, Rowena. (1999). The Sixties in America. Salem Press. p. 334.

So I was using Wiki as a tool to help try and see whether or not it was the author of the New Yorker article or the author of the book who was the bigot; or rather whose perspective was being presented in the article.

"""RfC: controversial multi-page move ==

 Summary by 89.101.221.42  

The issue is a recurring one. Proponents wanted:
 Ireland → Ireland (island) (or a variation)
 Republic of Ireland → Ireland (state) (or a variation)
 Ireland (disambiguation) → Ireland (or a variation)

Several different polls were opened simultaneously on (old page names):
 Ireland
 Ireland (disambiguation)
 Ireland disambiguation task force

A related poll had been run exactly one month earlier at (old page name):
 Republic of Ireland

And one month before then again also at (old page name):
 Republic of Ireland (archive)

Participation at the Ireland page was widest and consensus was against the move. Participation on two (recent) polls at the Republic of Ireland page also had wide participation and fell heavily against the move (both were closed). Participation at the disambiguation and task force pages were limited, but consensus in those polls came down (weakly) in favour of the move.

On this occasion the closing admin was:
 

Initially, Tariqabjotu performed the move request in error - having only seen the request at the task force page. When this was brought to his attention, he posted a response on this talk page. His decision was to maintain the move against consensus as consensus had arrived at """"an illogical conclusion"""" (which he linked to Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion). Later, he would comment that he had not read the discussions because, """"There's so much stuff to wade through..."""".

Issues believed to be at play:
 Forum shopping
 Vote stacking
 Consensus
 Polling is not a substitute for discussion

(Some) issues at play during the discussion:
 Disambiguation: Is there a primary topic?
 Naming convetions: Controversial names

89.101.221.42  
OBJECTION: What kind of 'summary' is this? The """"propenents wanted.."""" section above is selective.. where are the non-forked 'Ireland' options that opened the WP:IDTF taskforce? (ie Ireland as either state or island, but not both and not part of a dual state situation with Republic of Ireland??) The IP has ignored all the many main issues, and all the problems that have got us here, too.  Why are we letting this particular IP do this?

I'd like to clarify my concerns with the current version of the article, following the reversion of some of my edits by Stirling Newberry.

My general concern is that it doesn't accurately describe the debate about various causes of hyperinflation.  The article seems to me to be describing a stereotyped view of each side of the debate, which exagerrates the amount of controversy and obscures the amount of common ground.  """"Monetary"""" and """"Crisis of confidence"""" explanations of hyperinflation are describes as if they are two completely different competing theories,  held by different schools of thought (""""monetarists"""" and """"neo-liberals"""").

I think that the overwhelming majority of economists would see both monetary and confidence factors as being important as the initial 'root cause' of hyperinflation, with the importance varying from case to case.  A lot of the economics is very uncontroversial. For example:
It's totally uncontroversial that a massive increase in the money supply will cause hyperinflation.  Virtually any economist will agree that a big increase in the money supply is a possible trigger for hyperinflation, even if they don't believe it's the only one.  To say imply that neo-liberal economists don't believe that some hyperinflations are initially triggered by monetary expansion is to caricature their position.
It's totally uncontroversial that loss of confidence in the monetary system has a big role in hyperinflation.  To imply that monetarists don't see a role for reestablishing confidence in the currency - that just 'stopping the printing presses' is enough - is just misleading.  Monetarists talk about ways of establishing confidence all the time.

I would be interested to hear from Stirling what specific inaccuracies were in my edits, and why he deleted the statement """"The two models are closely related, and often economists may explain hyperinflation as being due to a combination of both effects.""""

"Jesse Ragan deletion nomination
Hi, I have received notice that the page I began about Jesse Ragan has been nominated for deletion based upon suspicion it is a vanity article. First, I am not the man (assuming Jesse ragan is male), nor have I met him/her. I began the article because as a professor of typography I felt Ragan's work significant, and that s/he had achieved work of lasting merit fairly early in life. S/he has been several time recognized by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) (the national professional organization for graphic designers), Ragan's work has appeared in respected design periodicals, and has lectured on typography at several Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) institutions. 

Several days ago I noticed removal of Ragan's name from credits for typefaces on the Tobias Frere-Jones article. My first thought was that some disagrement might have occured between Ragan and his former employers Hoefler & Frere-Jones, perhaps leading to a nomination for deletion. Mr. Hoefler wrote to me publicly on my talk page that Jesse Ragan was only one of many who worked on the project. That may be the case, but that would not discredit typefaces Ragan has produced entirely on his own, or the two mentions of his contributions to the Archer typeface on the AIGA web site. Clearly, at some point someone at Hoefler & Frere-Jones thought Ragan's contributions significant enough to provide his/her name (and not the rest of that team) to our national professional organization. The fact that Mr./Ms. Ragan is now independent and a competitor to other type foundries might be a part of this. But I have no knowledge of this. I know none of these people personally, and I respect the work of all of them as a review of my edit history will suggest. My primary reason for beginning the article was to increase the number of articles on typeface designers, and a secondary desire to increase the number of typography related articles in general. Jesse Ragan's work is very solid, even his/her own direct client list is impressive. In the world of typography, apprentices are historically given credit, witness Francesco Griffo who apprenticed to Aldus Manutius. It is my hope that Wikipedia will continue to make some room for subjects that though not block buster in scale are significant.",0

Michael Petrou article
Cool Hand Luke added criticism of Press TV from this article.  That's fine. As we agreed earlier all TV station articles have a criticism section.

However, this particular article goes on to say """"Only five days after launching, Press TV invited me to take part in a televised panel discussion about journalism in the Middle East. I argued that the biggest challenge facing journalists in the region is a lack of freedom and cited, among other examples, the case of Zahra Kazemi, the Canadian photojournalist who was raped, tortured and murdered by Iranian officials after she was arrested for taking photographs outside the Evin prison in Tehran. To his credit, the host and chief press officer, Shahab Mossavat, did not interrupt or silence me. He called my comments """"offensive"""" to Iran but pointed out that I was given free rein to say what I wished by Press TV. He then steered the conversation toward obstacles confronted by journalists in Israel."""" 

Thus the author demonstrates that Press TV let him criticize the Iranian government, which contradicts the criticism from the article. If we're going to add the critical parts of an article, shouldn't we add one sentence about the positive elements of the article too? What do you think? """,0

"Some Third-party opinions 

I've been asked to provide a third opinion on recent disputes.  Here goes:

Do you understand why File:Grand Kudu, Eritrea.jpg was deleted, Vetrisimino0?  I'd like to hear that you do; you should after a read of .  It seems the deletion was appropriate.  (And, it's reversible with permission logged via an [[Commons:OTRS| OTRS ticket].)
As for the suggestion to   From just reading this page, it looked like this had been settled, and the photos are to be left in and photos of members of other groups can be added over time (and there have been multiple other editors providing opinions already).  Good.  I would add that images should be shrunk or (better yet) merged, as at [:File:Eriamercol.jpg], so that this can happen.  However, I see File:Traditional_Eritrean_dance.jpg has replaced Tigrinya Eritrean wedding picture File:Eritrea_Eritrean_wedding.jpg.  Is this a problem?  I don't know the ethnicities of the photographed parties.  I haven't looked through the article's edit history and don't plan do.
Flickr has lots more appropriately licensed files.  I see File:Rashaida_family.png is on the french article, so there are photos available. 
Re. Faytinga photo: I think it should stay. Re.  The mayote site seems to be a mouthpiece for a particular set of politicial views, so I don't think it's a reliable source for much other than its own views. (My opinion would be swayed if it had a written fact-checking policy.)  However, given 3 other sources Vetrisimino0 says confirm Faytinga's mother's ethnicity, it seems reasonable to belive it's true.  Can you accept that, Middayexpress?  If not, I still think her picture merits inclusion (without noting her mother's ethnicity) and 'clutter' is a poor argument for its removal here.
I do wish to point out that a blanket order to a fellow editor like  is highly inappropriate and invalid here! The WP:BOLD guideline applies to, and allows, such edits.  However, so does the part of BOLD that guides one as to how to react when one's bold edits are not left in place.  So, in other words, both of you should read / review WP:BOLD. (I see no argument for an exception to BOLD.)

So, hopefully both sides will accept my opinions, and move on to edit on other topics within and without Eritrea.  There are points where I have agreed with each of you and points where I have disagreed with each of you (two each), and I believe I've been able to be fair and impartial.  Hope that helps.(t•c)",0

LOL that the same admin who made the block reviews the unblock request.  Just a """"slight"""" conflict of interest.
I had only made a single edit to the page in question when this user abusively put a """"edit war"""" template on my page and then threatened to report me for saying he """"acted like he owned the page,"""" a justifiable statement when he reverted an edit that simply removed an unnecessary, obvious, redundant statement that did not alter the factual content of the article. Had it been an ongoing edit war, that would be different, but I made a SINGLE edit after a previous edit ten days ago.  That he would put an """"edit war"""" template on my page in response to a single edit that only dealt style and not factual content is pretty clear evidence of harassment that he believes he owns the page.
He continued to harass me on MY OWN talk page.  How are my responses on MY OWN TALK PAGE considered """"trying to harass another user???""""

Here's a hint.

Those are sports drinks, which to my understanding and recollection by common knowledge, are intended to hydrate and provide some salts to athletes. A much different task than the intent of energy drinks.

Capri Sun is just a sugary drink with a fraction of fruit juice; 10% on what I've seen. Though it could different depending on location where it's sold, or what laws dictate toward the content or labeling.

 Comment 

My comments on Malleus' talk page were well beyond civil, even for a user talk page. They were a personal attack, and warranted serious sanction. 

For the record, it was a simple spontaneous eruption of contempt mingled with rage. Some have muttered that I went to his page to harass him; that's not the case. I went to continue a discussion that had been interrupted by earlier admin action. Some are muttering that I went there to """"bait"""" or """"poke"""" him into a block. I appreciate the complement but my Machiavellian intelligence is non-existant. Obviously. 

I lost respect for Malleus when he said, """"You already succeeded in getting me blocked, so I can only presume that you're trying to repeat the trick."""" I had made it clear that I had no intention of getting him blocked, he knew it, and yet regurgitated this populist slur. That's where he opened the door for my unmitigated opinion.

But my rant wasn't aimed at the dishonesty I perceived in that comment, that simply gave me permission to express a much deeper revulsion that's been building in me over the last few months with respect to this project. 

It's a feeling, so I'm not sure I can make it clear. A kind of nauseous disgust. It's to do with how we deal with the hurt we may cause others, other editors, our subjects and our readers. I'm pleased to see the faltering steps being taken toward a more civil ethos here. Those who actually know me know that means a great deal to me. There is a long way to go. Pesky pointed out that finding the right form of words for what's required is difficult. I agree. That's the challenge. The right form of words will emerge if we discuss these questions enough.

With regard to respectful discourse between editors, Malleus has been addressing the real root of the civility problem here for years. Telling someone to fuck off, or calling them a cunt is obviously uncivil and an easy call for an admin. But the real evil here is not Malleus and me calling each other names, it's the sleazy aside from one editor to another, undermining the reputation of a third. One editor can bully or badger another for days or weeks without ever calling them a name, and it's their victim that cops a block when they respond accordingly. So I'm glad to see more admins taking civility seriously, but you're going to have to work on the sophistication of your approach.

I'm disgusted by the way this project treats its readers with regard to controversial images. The bit that disgusts me is the mantra that """"we don't care if we offend our readers."""" Seriously. That has been repeated ad nauseam during the Muhammad images debates and others. I can see no excuse for that attitude, and don't want to participate in an enterprise that has that attitude towards its readership.

And finally, contempt for our subjects. I first noticed this on a BLP. A teenage girl and her boyfriend made a sex tape. Later, when she was a minor local celebrity, the tape was posted on the net, without her permission. It's there now; Google her name and """"sex tape"""" and you got it. She's now won a TV competition, so is becoming better known.

The tape's existence has been mentioned a few times in the press, but not much, and usually the """"nudge, nudge, lucky bastard"""" type of comment, but it doesn't seem to have affected her career or even her private life. An RfC asked """"Should we mention the tape?"""" Policy-wise you can make a case for its inclusion, but it's borderline. What really disgusted me was the utter unconcern of many editors for the effect our inclusion of the factoid would have on the visibility of the tape, and the consequent effect this would have on the woman. I won't elaborate further; you either get it or you don't.

And it was concern for the subject of a BLP that brought Malleus and me together. He was arguing for the preservation of a borderline notable BLP that the subject said was distressing him. I argued that it should go, simply because it's borderline notable and the subject doesn't want it. 

Although Malleus asserted the wishes of the subject are irrelevant, an assertion he is incapable of justifying, and a position I find morally repugnant, he deemed it appropriate to also declare the subject's claim of distress is implausible. Unfortunately, Jimbo had already primed me with a similar judgment. Jimbo had ignored my response, so I thought I'd add a little emphasis when I explained my view to Malleus.

"""::::::::::Oh I do enjoy insulting people whose behaviour makes them fully deserving of insults. It was you that made the issue of Ethnologue being a RS a big affair (as scripta manent - even in WP - all a reader has is to go up a few comments and see arrogant statements such as """"Until you can produce a reliable linguistic source that has conducted more recent linguistic surveys in northern Greece, then Ethnologue is the most recent, most reliable source."""" when there was no census in 1986 to begin with! The gall of some people is astounding: they've all become """"specialists"""" when they can hardly follow the Greek literature - because if they did you would be (a) dismissing Ethnologue's 1986 crap outright and (b) quoting the V-PRC survey which is recent and despite an obvious flaw of assuming no pluri-lingual descent/ability is the most recent and extensive statistical country-wide survey of use/understanding of non-Greek languages and significant Greek dialects in Greece to-date. If you were a specialist you would know that the US SD's """"estimate"""" is not the result of a survey (do you seriously believe that any type of similar survey by a foreign power into such a matter would have gone unnoticed and not being reported in the Greek media causing a diplomatic episode?) but the estimate based on visits to some parts of Macedonia (in Greece) of a certain diplomat (later to become infamous through a very public resignation) called Brady Keisling that single-handedly raised the profile of the issue in the SD's HR reports. If you were a specialist - instead of trying to guess numbers you would be giving the number of villages in which the language was spoken by at least some inhabitants according to the 1996 Euromosaic study (which your pal FPS has apparently read - but still has been unable to digest enough to add Arvanites in Thrace in his """"map""""). Then again you could do worse - your other pal Jim62sch seriously believes that you could have a non-government sponsored census (mind you not survey) in Greece (actually I wonder in how many developed countries can anyone other than the government """"convince"""" people to stay home and open their doors for census takers to visit). Or that the results of such a private 1986 census would not become public until 2005! Maybe the evil Greek nationalists had a hand in that as well.

 Properly converting meters to feet 

Since I'm blocked from editing, could someone please fix the conversion templates used on the articles I edited? Your converter thinks 1 meter equals 3.3 feet. Thus, 27.3 m is converted into 90 feet.

"""I've included a passage of the bible on my user page. I want it to open the page, and will keep it here, because I feel it acentuates the writing that follows.

so, without any further ado, here is some biblical goodness.

THE BEST THINGS HAVE BEEN CULMINATED 
Zeal to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured 
by others, deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold entertainment in the world.  It is welcomed 
with suspicion instead of love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole left for cavil to enter, (and 
cavil, if it do not find a hole, will make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned.  This will easily 
be granted by as many as know story, or have any experience.  For, was there ever any-projected, that savoured any way of 
newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of gainsaying, or opposition?  A man would think that Civility, 
wholesome Laws, learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we speak of no more things of this kind) 
should be as safe as a Sanctuary, and out of shot, as they say, that no man would lift up the heel, no, nor dog move his 
tongue against the motioners of them. For by the first, we are distinguished from brute beasts lead with sensuality; By the 
second, we are bridled and restrained from outrageous behaviour, and from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by 
violence; By the third, we are enabled to inform and reform others, by the light and feeling that we have attained unto 
ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth being brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our differences than by 
writings which are endless; And lastly, that the Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and 
conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing 
fathers and mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon their breasts (and upon whose breasts 
again themselves do hang to receive the Spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and support fit for their estates. 
Thus it is apparent, that these things which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore, that none, either without 
absurdity can speak against them, or without note of wickedness can spurn against them. 
Yet for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [Anacharsis with others] have been brought to untimely death for 
none other fault, but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and discipline; and that in some Commonwealths 
[e.g. Locri] it was made a capital crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an old, though the 
same were most pernicious; And that certain [Cato the elder], which would be counted pillars of the State, and patterns of 
Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way to good Letters and refined speech, but bare 
themselves as averse from them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; And fourthly, that he was no babe, but a great clerk 
[Gregory the Divine], that gave forth (and in writing to remain to posterity) in passion peradventure, but yet he gave forth, 
that he had not seen any profit to come by any Synod, or meeting of the Clergy, but rather the contrary; And lastly, against 
Church-maintenance and allowance, in such sort, as the Ambassadors and messengers of the great King of Kings should be 
furnished, it is not unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better by the reporter himself [Nauclerus], 
though superstitious) was devised; Namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of Christianity in the Church of 
Rome, then a true Church, were liberally endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying:  Now is poison poured 
down into the Church, etc.  Thus not only as oft as we speak, as one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or 
consequence, we subject ourselves to everyone’s censure, and happy is he that is least tossed upon tongues; for utterly to 
escape the snatch of them it is impossible.  If any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of the meaner sort only, and 
that Princes are privileged by their high estate, he is deceived.  """"As the sword devoureth as well one as the other,"""" as it is in 
Samuel [2 Sam 11:25], nay as the great Commander charged his soldiers in a certain battle, to strike at no part of the enemy, 
but at the face; And as the King of Syria commanded his chief Captains to """"fight neither with small nor great, save only 
against the King of Israel:"""" [1 Kings 22:31] so it is too tru",0

"Side note
If I'm going to be indef blocked then User:Smsarmad (SMS), the guy who filed SPI without notifying me, should also be indef blocked. He has been abusing Indian and Afghan editors, creating and using multiple accounts since at least 2008, illegally uploading many images, using proxies, vandalizing Pashtun related, Afghan related and Indian related pages.  
This SPI investigation report from 2007 clearly establishes that he is a disruptive vandal  and lives in Islamabad, Pakistan , has used socks and open proxy located in Greece. 
 began calling me dark-skinned Indian followed by cursing everyone, and was edit-warring with everyone, and when BBBAAACCC got blocked, an IP (212.174.135.194) from Turkey (a country next to Greece) began revert-warring in order to keep BBBAAACCC's version of pages.
As noted by User:UzEE in the above 2007 report, (SMS) connects himself with Pakistan military. I've noticed that many banned socks have been behaving exactly like SMS and uploading copyrighted images (without permission) relating Pakistan's military, see . According to this recent revert by SMS, he exposed himself that he belongs to a special community within the Hindkowan group, they generally don't associate Pashtuns, and I notice this in SMS's actions. 
He often uses Islamabad IPs to edit, see , , and  and makes other edits by his other socks (User:TopGun  User:MHDH ) so nobody notices but I do because I get paid for doing this )
BBBAAACCC + SMS + TopGun + Ironboy11 + proxies + Islamabad IPs all relate to banned editor , this light-skinned Pakistani guy, the 'Grand Sockmaster' and mass copyright infringer. Clear Proof: 1 2, 3. He often appeared at Siddiqui article since December 2005, used to edit from USA but now from Islamabad.

Of course, of course, Pharos, I am familiar with Judaism (I edited to """"Feature Artice"""" the Names of God in Judaism)... The point I am making is that the concept of divinity is very diverse amongst religions. This article is entitled """"List of self-proclaimed deities"""". It is not called List of people that claim or claimed to be God.  My contention is that the article needs to narrow its scope to become useful. For example, in Sikhism, (and Andries is correct in regard of non-idolatry), their gurus are considered to be of divine providence (see the halos behind any Sikh guru portrait...).  For example if we call this article, """"List of people that claim or claimed to be the Creator"""", it will be an appropriate distinction. When we say """"deity"""", then the scope is too wide resulting in an article that does not provide any encyclopedic value IMO, and one that looks like better beloning in a tabloid...  """,0

Whilst I don't agree with your reasoning, I am happy to add my """"reference"""" to Further Reading rather than References.

Sadly, much of what passes for journalism today is just PR stuff, which begs the question of how seriously we should take a lot of references!

I've great respect for GwenGale. I don't, however, have any respect whatsoever for the preposterous, not to say idiotic, rules and policies of WP. That and that alone makes me unsuitable for editing any WP article whatsoever. I also think that it is those very rules and policies that gut any integrity a so called minority view article could ever have. The only thing the WP rules and policies have accomplished at the AS article is to prevent useful, important and thoroughly verified information to be included, at the same time irrelevant and factually false claims have been inflated and scattered all through the article. There is no integrity there, very little informative value and a high degree of distortion. If that is the WP idea of """"integrity"""", then that is an integrity not worth protecting. And isn't WP supposed to the free and public encyclopedia? If that is the case, why should we be bound by any dictates from Jimmy Wales? We are the editors, not him. He may have founded it, but we are the ones upholding it. By the logic employed by some editors here, the government should be allowed to have total control of the internet, because it was government that """"created"""" the internet. That is the principle WP seems to follow, and I reject that principle. I also submit that any rule and policy that is so demonstrably destructive as those employed in editing the AS article can and should be altered or abolished.   """,0

 Havana City vs. Havana City Province 

The source of that confusion is that Havana City Province includes Havana and other cities like Marianao, Santiago de las Vegas, San Miguel del Padron, Regla, Guanabacoa and so on, with their own city halls, institutions, history, etc. Now, it is true that the history, the economy and the social lives of those cities have a strong bond with Havana. For example, Santiago de las Vegas grew because of the importance of the tobacco plantations, Havana had (and still has) tobacco factories. Havana was the most important port of the Spanish Empire in America, and the cities around also enriched because of that fact. Havana's growth swallowed all those cities around, and nowadays they seem to be one and only city, but this is only apparent. Even nowadays, when someone who lives in Marianao borough or district crosses the Almendares River, which is the border, he/she always says """"I'm going to Havana to shop"""". Anyway, you can merge both articles, or write one article for Havana and do the same for the rest of the disctrics. By the way, the population of Havana City Province of 2.2 million people, are from the last census of 2002. In ten years, the population have grown, for sure.

I, personally, would dispute that sexuality is even a continuum. I would agree that heterosexuality, DEFINDED AS PROCREATION, has been the norm, DEFINED AS COMMON AND/OR TYPICAL, throughout history, even normative, DEFINED AS PRESCRIPTIVE. Since you also include marriage, I would need to be convinced and thus currently disagree on that point also.

However, we need to find sources before we make such assertions in articles, and I will oppose their addition until cited.

So you're the kind of sick bastard that would've condoned slavery just because everybody you knew did?

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

Yes, those are two reverts; however, the 1RR restriction on myself was only in regards to Canadian monarchy articles, and PoC's edits, not to other pages or other editors.

"Then the ban will probably have to be made permanent.  Your decision, admins. 

I had a sick feeling it would come to this.  It always seems to, in this day and age.

This will probably be declared my last wiki-edit by the administrators (and that's even if I'm allowed to put this on my Talk page), for I am compelled to believe that the administrators of Wikipedia will have to extend my ban permanently, not as a function of a Wikibreak, but as a function that I cannot exercise “good faith” in a consensus which does not care whether the information is accurate, verifiable, or even true.

In fact, given the current state of Wikipedia, it is no longer sufficient nor even necessary to act in “good faith” and provide verifiable information.  What is sufficient, and the only thing necessary, is to provide information the collective will accept as verified – note that I did not say “verifiable”.  If the garbage I have to put up with like on almost every meaningful edit I've made in the last eight weeks is true, the collective has already spoken and I have no place on Wikipedia whatsoever, especially because I believe that the consensus is not only wrong, but either flagrantly mis-informed or down-right stupid.

This stands in violation of basically all five pillars of Wikipedia.

First, Wikipedia is NOT an encyclopedia as long as the general public is allowed to edit it, but only in the form in which a collective will accept.

I will give a good example of this in the first real problem I ran in to about 6-8 weeks ago:

BCS National Championship Game.  I tried a number of edits to properly represent the BCS' nullification of the participation of USC in two illegal Championship Games, and removing their designation, since the games no longer are believed to have taken place.  http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=6632189   An edit war began on that subject, and the subject of Wikipedia's rules regarding “no damnatio memoriae came up.  I proposed, and repeatedly, that the concept of damnatio memoriae applied, since that was the exact penalty imposed by the BCS when they nullified the entire participation of USC in the 2005 Orange Bowl and 2006 Rose Bowl (pages (along with USC's entire 2005 season, nullified by the NCAA beforehand) I would've deleted eight weeks ago under encyclopedic verification, but we now have a conflict between damnatio memoriae and encyclopedic verification).

AND, since Wikipedia does not respect the BCS as a sanctioning body (trying to remain neutral – I'll get to that in a moment in part two!), Wikipedia accepts as valid USC's 14 vacated victories, including in a BCS National Championship Game which no longer logistically should exist.  Hence, Wikipedia  recognizes (in the form that they won the 2005 Orange Bowl) USC as the BCS National Champion – if Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and their participation in the 2006 Rose Bowl, which was also nullified by the BCS.

Ergo, we now have a non-encyclopedic, non-verifiable situation which is, in fact, false!  Only the sanctioning body can give sanction to the event, and only the sanctioning body can take it away.  (Remember this one for later, as well!)  I had respected the decision of “no damnatio memoriae, but can do so no longer, because of the fact that it creates an encyclopedic falsehood!

And because the collective accepts “no damnatio memoriae, even in cases where it applies, we now have to change one of the hardest and fastest rules on Wikipedia, on every editing page.

Encyclopedic content must only be considered verified by the collective.  That is all, and also that is the only acceptable basis for content on Wikipedia – actual encyclopedic verification is no longer sufficient nor necessary.  Anything short of that will be removed by the collective.

If I am reinstated, I am considering removal of all mentions of vacated participation in games.  That means the 2005 Orange and 2006 Rose Bowls go, as does their mentions in BCS National Championship Game, as well as USC's entire 2005 season page, replaced with notations of the nullifications.  Any other games where the participation of one or both schools are removed also go as well.  (As one example, the 2011 Sugar Bowl may also be deleted, if the NCAA or BCS nullifies specifically Ohio State's participation in the event.)

That dovetails nicely into debunking pillar number two:

If the collective is the sole basis for acceptability on Wikipedia, then Wikipedia cannot be neutral.  In fact, when the collective is mis-informed and prejudicial, on top of being inaccurate, this redoubles that, since the collective enforces the rules, Wikipedia is not at all neutral, but written with the biases of the collective in mind.

Iranian Villagers
Halstead et al. reported that some Iranian villagers with very little animal product intake (dairy once a week, meat once a month) had normal B12 levels. None had megaloblastic anemia. Their average B12 level was 411 pg/ml which was quite high considering their diet. The authors speculated this could be because their diets, which were very low in protein, allowed for B12-producing bacteria to ascend into the ileum where the B12 could be absorbed. They also speculated that because they lived among their farm animals and their living areas were littered with feces, they picked up enough B12 through contamination.

Halstead et al.'s 1960 report was in contrast to Wokes et al.'s 1955 report  in which numerous British vegans were found to have neurological symptoms of B12 deficiency.

Conclusion
B12 production by bacteria in the small intestine is possible. Some vegans can ward of overt vitamin B12 deficiency, and even mild B12 deficiency by remaining cautious. Now people like mihaiam may choose to doubt all these scientific findings hinging on their favourite anti-vegan blogs.

Note

I hope these information helps anybody who is interested.

In response to User:Viridae telling me that we were going to lots of trouble over something that would be deleted anyway, I said, Meh, let the guy feel happy.

I just want him to stop pinging me on IRC with his s. )—•(talk) 

Why I said """"all those things""""...taking them one at at time... 
First sentence: I don't mind doing a lot of work to help someone out, even if I think that it is towards something that will eventually be deleted. I feel that the simple act of responding to someone else's good faith request for help is inherently worthy of my time. 
Second sentence: You seemed to be concerned over people's ability to find your article and impatient about how nothing was being done about it. What I did was to add something that would enable people to find your article and address your apparent concern.
Third sentence: I was/am fairly certain that the AfD discussion I linked to earlier will result in deletion of the article and its associated articles, including the article that I linked to using , especially since the first time it was there it was a unanimous decision to delete. This is no reflection on you. It is merely that I don't think the article is sufficiently noteworthy for inclusion on Wikipedia given our standards. I don't think any harm is done by linking to it, but if your article is deleted we will need to remove the link to it.
Fourth sentence: Every time you use  it creates a new alert in the IRC channel I was trying to get you to join. It is quite annoying when people repeatedly use it. 
I hope that clarifies things. I thought that I had helped you in pointing you towards the AfD, explaining where to find things and the rationale behind their movement. The fact that I disagree with you about the inclusion of the article shouldn't invalidate all the help I gave, should it? That doesn't seem right to me. I am sorry if you felt that I was being egregiously unhelpful. I want you to know that I have argued on your behalf against blocking you, but if you continue to threaten disruptive behavior to make a point regarding your feelings of unjust deletion I will no longer be able to assume good faith.

From Parasaraprasna, Kapur Singh, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, Amritsar

 Thus those who see in the origin and contents of the Sikh
movement anything of this VaiSlJavism or the historical Bhakti
movement of the Middle ages, which was based on this VaiSDavism
or cognate propositions, show a complete lack of understanding ofthe
real nature of Sikhism. Beyond the fact that Sikhism is of historical
proximity to this Bhakti movement of the Middle ages, and that it
somewhat partakes of the atmosphere and temper of VaiSDavist
climate, it has not much in common with the latter. Among the
principal features of this climate are its anti-Brahmanical attitude, its
preference for vernaculars26 over Sanskrit, its total surrender theory,
such as Lokacarya's marjara27 doctrine, its stress on devotion through
image-worship rather than through knowledge, and its own peculiar
forms of ritualism, such as caste-marks.

It is easy to demonstrate that similarities of Sikhism with some of
these features are not so intimate or fundamental as to suggest any

Thanks on improving the NPOV of An Inconvenient Truth
Thanks for rebalancing the NPOV equilibrium of this article.  You have achieved by adding rebuttals within the science section in homeopathic doses what I could not by being I gather too straightforward.  I contributed a huge amount of research that was immediately taken out by MastCell.  I just gave up and placed a NPOV tag on this one-sided article at the time.  The tag lasted no more than 2 hours, as it was promptly removed by ILike2BeAnonymous (who is deemed by Wikipedia to be a saint as he apparently as protected many articles against vandalism).  But, ILike2BeAnonymous removed the NPOV tag without making a single contribution to rebalance the NPOV equilibrium.  I gather he thought my tag amounted to vandalism.  Finally, you courageously stepped in.  As you can see per the Discussion history you must be the third or fourth editor who is taking a rebutting balanced stand towards this article.  Of this group, I congratulate you for being so far the most successful.  

If I may, I would encourage you to do even just a bit more.  An Inconvenient Truth's main message is that because of anthropogenic CO2 emission temperatures will rise by the end of the century leading to a probable (entire) melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps leading to sea level rise of 20 to 40 feet submerging our seashore civilization as we know it.  The slides showing what such a sea level rise looks like (maps of cities, states, countries) are pretty dramatic.  But, they have absolutely no scientific bearing.  The IPCC forecasts a sea level rise ranges from several inches inches to just 3 feet in the worst case scenario.  I think this is a critical balancing point to insert within the science section of the article.  I have tried, and got censored immediately.

On the same subject, I am glad you came across the pretty impressive document """"A Skeptic's Guide to an Inconvenient Truth.""""  It is incredibly well researched and referenced.  By the end, there is hardly a page of the book or slide of the movie that is not effectively rebutted by data based scientific studies.  Keep up the good work. """,0

White House circumcision petition needs signers up to and on OCT 23 https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/petition/ban-non-therapeutic-routine-infant-circumcision/2tqgSZtG Routine infant circumcision is in direct violation of human rights. It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

 Information removed

Bono supposedly contributes vocals to the track """"Long Black Veil"""" but in a strange twist he is not credited in the album credits.  The information about his involvment comes from various news bits over the years, and mention of this album in discographies published by those who would know, like Niall Stokes.

The lead vocals are by Mick Jagger and The Chieftens.  Originally they were performed by Bono, but were not used.  These had been recorded at Windmill Lane.  Although Bono's vocals were not used, the instrumentals from that session were supposedly used, meaning it may be possible to hear Bono way back in the mix somewhere.

 Proposed change to lede 

The current lede states that """" Thermal expansion, which is well-quantified, is currently the primary contributor to sea level rise and is expected to be the primary contributor over the course of the next century.""""

However, while thermal expansion is expected to contribute more than half the increase in the coming century, it isn't the primary contributor currently.

From AR4 page 409, """"Thermal expansion is projected
to contribute more than half of the average rise,..."""" but """"During recent years (1993–2003), for which the observing system is much better, thermal expansion and melting of land ice each account for about half of the observed sea level rise,""""

I propose the following replacement sentence:
At the end of the 20th century, thermal expansion and melting of land ice contributed roughly equally to sea level rise, while thermal expansion is expected to contribute more than half the rise in the upcoming century.

I also intent to remove the subsequent sentence, """"Glacial contributions to sea-level rise are less important, and are more difficult to predict and quantify"""" as it is no longer needed. 

Current footnote 8 doesn't support the claim, or at least I couldn't find it as it is the AR4 chapter on Climate models, not the chapter on Sea Level. I will add the reference to the Sea Level chapter

     background: """"#000000"""",
     color: """"#00dd00"""",
     selBackground: """"#00dd00"""",
     selColor: """"#000000"""",
     borderColor: """"#00dd00""""
 }
You can for example wrap it in the following, or any other way that's okay in JavaScript. (The rationale behind this settings scheme is that I use various scripts, some of my own, some of which have settings, and some written by others, which may have settings as well, so I wanted to be sure settings for my scripts are in a seperate namespace, where they can't touch or clash with those of other scripts.)
 Gerbrant = {
     hidePane = ...
 }
I may need some time to iron out a little bug, but at least it works. As for the other problem, this is caused by the script's (i.e. my) assumption that either the interwiki list or the toolbox is the last menu. If this isn't true for some reason, things can go wrong. I'll try to fix this if I can find a good test script to work with. Also, if you have suggestions for better colour values or a good way to automagically detect common colour skins like green-on-black so I could select more appropriate defaults, I'd like to hear them.

Stone Censors
I don’t know that I’m wrong; in fact, I’m quite certain that you and AuburnPilot are in the wrong. You can censor me and block me all you want – you’ve got the power – but you can’t make me confess to wrongs of which I am innocent. Not yet, anyway. And you can’t make me say that you’re right, when you are as wrong as hell. It’s about time somebody talked back to you.

“If you were to discuss your edits, you won't [sic] be in this position right now.” (Since I had already discussed my edits, physicq’s statement above is a case of “a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.”)

That’s funny peculiar, because wikicensors with the correct politics somehow never have to “discuss” their “edits.” They just go and censor people with whom they disagree, and then demand that the censees justify the worth of the censored passages or links or footnotes. And guess what? The censees’ explanations, no matter how well-founded and eloquent, are never sufficient to make the censors change their minds. Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, """"commissars""""?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed. That the censors continue demanding such arguments is because they have a sadistic glee for wasting other people’s precious time and energy.

In case an open-minded (but perhaps less experienced) reader should suspect that I am just engaging in bluster, I had already made my argument in my previous entry on this page (which AuburnPilot has archived in a handsome tan box at the bottom of User_talk:AuburnPilot under the uncivil category, “spam”) for why the footnotes and links I inserted were legitimate, but physicq aka physicq210 derided those arguments as a “polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks,” and mocked my criticism of his abuse of authority as “whining.” In one case, I pointed out that the external link that AuburnPilot defamed as “spam” and censored, was a classic magazine article related to the  Racial Profiling Hoax.

(Speaking of which, Wikipedia's Racial profiling article is hopelessly POV through the censors’ deleting of links to articles debunking the hoax, and inserting of links to fraudulent “literature” such as thoroughly debunked work by the ACLU.)

In the case of a footnote that AuburnPilot also defamed as “spam” and censored, he cut the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the  Duke Rape Hoax, which was published by the most brilliant, reliable magazine on the Web, VDARE.

BTW, AuburnPilot asserts that the sources in question are not “reliable” or “verifiable,” and do not maintain “neutrality.” Aside from the fact that thousands of Wikipedia articles are transparent political propaganda, or no more than love or hate letters to certain public figures (particularly entertainers or athletes), AuburnPilot has misrepresented the Wikipedia rule on neutrality. There is no requirement that every source be neutral (as opposed to reliable and verifiable), only that every Wikipedia article be neutral.

WP:NPOV

“All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source. For guidance on how to make an article conform to the neutral point of view, see the NPOV tutorial.”

As for “verifiablilty,” the VDARE source has over 100 hyperlinks to supporting documentation from newspapers, magazines, TV and radio news organizations, and legal filings; if that isn’t “verifiable,” then nothing is.

Now, I ask you. If I have already made my best argument for including the aforementioned links and footnotes, and physicq aka physicq210 responds by misrepresenting what I said, claiming that I have made no attempt at supporting my position, and referring to my defense as “whining,” what possible reason could I have for continuing such a charade?

Plus, why should I be on the defensive? If I were dealing with fair, reasonable people, that might make sense. But fair, reasonable people would not do as AuburnPilot did, and first censor my edits, and then demand I justify their value on the talk pages. (And physicq would not have responded to an edit war by throwing in with AuburnPilot, immediately blocking me, and charging me with “disruptive edits.” That alone is proof of physicq’s unfitness as an administrator.) No, AuburnPilot would not have censored my work, but would have asked me on the talk page why I thought it belonged. No, strike that. He would have hit the links and read the articles in question.

Comment.  It's confusing enough that I am not sure what """"disagree"""" means in this conversation.  A quick run through my sources indicates that """"folk costume"""", """"folk dress"""", """"national dress"""", """"ethnic costume"""", """"traditonal dress"""" etc. are all used pretty much interchangeably.  I would support a move to """"folk costume"""" or """"folk dress"""" for the reasons cited above, but """"folk costume"""" should not be a subset of """"national dress"""" since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified (at least in Europe - as mentioned, some folk dress is still evolving).

[For what it's worth, I wouldn't characterize square dance clothes or bolo ties as folk dress - western wear is a modern retro concept based on romanticized notions of 19th century clothing, and bolo ties are a modern invention!  But bolo ties and cowboy shirts are certainly regional dress.]

By the way, the use of narrow use """"costume"""" to mean """"theatrical costume"""" is about as common as the use of """"dress"""" to mean """"a woman's garment with a skirt"""".  Both """"costume"""" and """"dress"""" have these narrow, non-specialist, everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of Wikipedia.  """"Clothing"""" is probably the most neutral and inclusive term, but we struggle in choosing """"Medieval clothing"""" vs. """"Medieval costume"""" vs. """"Medieval dress"""".  And """"folk clothing"""" is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb.  In the museum and art-historical worlds, """"costume"""" and """"dress"""" are both preferred terms.

OED definitions are pertinent here: 
COSTUME: The mode or fashion of personal attire and dress (including the way of wearing the hair, style of clothing and personal adornment) belonging to a particular nation, class, or period.
DRESS: Personal attire or apparel: orig. that proper to some special rank or order of person, or to some ceremony or function; but, in later use, often merely: Clothing, costume, garb, esp. that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering.

 is right, in that there isn't a simple solution; we're going to have a ton of redirects and alterate terms whichever way we go.  Gievn the OED definitions, I'd say """"Folk costume"""" is more accurate.  But I personally prefer """"Folk dress"""", and I'd choose that over """"National dress"""". -   """,0

I don't know the poet articles you speak of, so I don't know what might be different with them, but the rule as I understand it is that poetry should be quoted only as an integrated part of the article's discussion. For example, it is not sufficient to say """"Here is a poem by Bhupi Sherchan:"""", but it might be appropriate to say """"One of the characteristics of Bhupi Sherchan's style is [such-and-such], as can be seen in these verses from [poem]:"""".

There was also another consideration, which I didn't mention in my edit reason because I thought perhaps it was too obvious: This is the English-language Wikipedia, and there is an expectation that English-language readers can read any article without missing something because it's in another language. That doesn't necessarily mean you can't quote from another language at all, but if you do it should be accompanied by a suitable translation into English.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack!

"""Carl_Paladino&diff;=388097440&oldid;=388080941 October 1], and again on October 2. On Linda McMahon, you have a long history of editing and edit warring on the page, and probably would have been blocked if Malinaccier hadn't protected the page on September 17; your October 1 and October 2 edits are inadvisable due to your history on that page, but I'm not really concerned with those since the things you reverted are borderline vandalism. Therefore the main motivation for the current block was your final edit to Carl Paladino.    ♦ ♣ ♠ 
I'm not sure I buy two reverts in two days as disruptive edit warring. Moreover, the combination of low speed and non-explicit warnings are concerning. Certainly, the articles in question attract people writing for differing political agendas, but I'm not aware of any specific sanctions/enforcement which apply to these articles at the moment.   
Sir - my """"history of edit warring"""" was basically two years ago.  20 total edits on a page [Linda McMahon]] which another editor has over 800 edits does not seem to me to show anything near an edit war.  So I am surprised to see your rationale is the Carl Paladino page!   is a legitimate edit, and not actionable at all.  is also proper, and a day earlier.  I have a grand total of 28 edits on that page, or an average or just over an edit a day also removing clear vandalism as well).  But you blocked me without any indication of my crime, and were absent for quite a while - leaving me in limbo.  Frankly, 72 hours for a person who has no recent edit war problems seems extreme.   And for this use of block as punishment - I have doubts as to propriety thereof.  Did you block because Ohiostandard kept asserting that I was edit warring?  AFAICT, he never even posted a single diff for his charge. Thank you - now can I be unblocked so I can resume normal editing?  My radiation treatment limits my activities quite a bit.  Oh - look at this sort of """"editor"""" I have had to face at ,  and a favorite example to show the kind of edits I reverted on the article.    
This looks like a bad block, and even worse when I read the explaination from the admin. Is there any """"history/involvement"""" per say with the blocking admin?   
WRT asserting that Ohiostandard 'warned me"""" - he never edited on the Paladino article, nor mentioned it to me. Right now the block is clearly punitive, and I respectfully request it be removed with a note that it was not """"edit war"""" on my part. I do not see the point in having a clear record for nearly two years - and then being blocked for a 1RR because someone """"thinks"""" I must be watched! The only connection I have with Ohiostandard is that he did not like my post about Screwball23.   
Examples of current edits from others  .  And of course the current content of """" Content of the emails in question includes video of dancing African tribesmen under the title """"Obama Inauguration Rehearsal"""", a video titled """"Miss France 2008 Fucking"""", an altered image of President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama dressed as a pimp and a prostitute, an image of a cargo plane landing in an African desert behind a group of panicked men titled """"Run, Niggers, Run!"""" and a video portraying a woman engaged in copulation with a horse.

If a full post-termination hearing is available, the Loudermill pretermination hearing is minimal.

In such situations the employee would have an opportunity to respond in the pretermination hearing as long as she had available a post-termination hearing.

St. Louis is one of those diocese (Baltimore is the other that comes to mind) that sometimes has a Cardinal, but not always.  We have not had one as Abp. since Cardinal Carberry retired in the early 1980's (he died in about 1998).  I think as the church becomes less a European and North American church we will see fewer cardinals from small and mid-sized diocese like STL and more from Africa, Asia, and South America.

Hey Riana, I hope everything is good with you and that you're enjoying the weekend.

"I agree this article is not based on Sarah Palin. That is why I want the revert. Since those comments many edits have been made to the article, and it would be foolish to assume those edits were made solely with intent to improve the article. I think this talk page alone is enough evidence of that. Prior to comments made, the article hadn't been edited in weeks and most of the edits prior to that were minor edits, mostly a bunch of grammar and some reworking of sentences and sentence structure. I think the lack of editing of the article and the nature of previous edits shows that for such a longstanding article, there was a silent consensus that the article was good and needing very little. 

Now look at it. The section on the ride alone dominates the article, much of it relates to whether or not Revere was warning who or what when prior to June 5th such sections and commentary were neither present nor viewed as necessary to article.

Mangled Units of Transmission Speed
Can anyone explain what units CuteFTP uses for """"Speed"""" - I see """"kbs"""" and """"mbs"""" in the CuteFTP 8 """"Queue Window"""" for example, but these are not valid units.  """"kbs"""" suggests """"kilo-byte seconds"""" or """"kilo-bit seconds"""" ... but both are nonsense units (should be either kbps or kb/s).  Similarly, """"mbs"""" suggests """"milli-byte seconds"""" or """"milli-bit seconds"""" which is doubly nonsense - both because it is a nonsense unit and also because (even if they mean mbps or mb/s) it is a ridiculously small unit.  I realize that they probably mean """"Mega"""" rather than """"milli"""" - but then they should use capital """"M"""".

""""Baud"""" used to be used universally for data transmission rates, and that is, at least, unambiguous.

 A tag has been placed on Argaman requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Or does he have a problem with allowing newcomers to work on wikipedia as well and merely try to land them in trouble instead? I am not really sure why he is determined to complain about me no matter what edit I make, but his aggressive stance is clear, and if everyone were to behave this way towards newbies, I am sure wikipedia would become a very isolated place, which it is indeed not.

Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as sources. This is in part because we have no way of knowing who has written or posted them, and in part because there is no editorial oversight or third-party fact-checking. 

A self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It includes personal websites, and books published by vanity presses. Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field.

Tone and style of article

Just a passerby and not a wikipedia editor per se. However, I felt compelled to leavea comment regarding the tone and style of the article: it suffer from sounding very personal, and has a tone of what one would expect a non-scholar explaining something in emphatic language. (the overabundance of quotation marks is one symptom, but there are other, such as the """"for the benefit of Europeans"""", which takes away from the neutral tone an encyclopedic article.) I'm not an expert on the subject (in fact I know very little about it, which is why I came here), but even to me it would be better if the page instead sourced a number of published treatises/works on the subject instead of going into a quasi-emotional and ambiguous personal essay-style on the subject. It sounds to me like the article attempts to unite the various concepts and make it as culturally vague and generalized and """"acceptable"""" (as in, lacking cultural, ritual and mythical specifics that would make different versions more characterized) as possible - and this makes the article sounds a little - dare I say - """"New Agey"""". (for lack of a better term.) I think more people would appreciate more specific mythic instances and rituals that specifically dealt with the Great Spirit/Mystery (and also those that established important differences between various views on the subject, as one would expect from proper research) - if those are available - as opposed to the currently rather watered-out explanation. 

As this is a very interesting subject, I'm looking forward to seeing how the article develops. ) Best of luck.

A discussion for another day perhaps? ;) Take Care,  

 Indeed. And good luck, ok? Got your message - ✍ 

The fight continues! (As long as i am around to keep my CRASS vinyl spinnin' ;)  

Thank you for adding the info: What you've just done is more than they have accomplished in the last year for us oddly enough since this law passed. Now we have something to point to when we create all our lovely links ;) Total sweetness, thanks again  

Signed up for the group, got your message ) Thanks much! See you there!   

Thanks for the link update 8-) I didn't want to post it if people wouldn't like it. Some minor changes to our site i believe make it 'more appealing' to a broader audience as well (Just finished them...) Thanks again for the assist - We appreciate it greatly!  

I like the changes... Thanks for the assist with that! It was a nice surprise 8-)  

FYI, Insurance Discrimination was one of the top 3 things we won with HB 2661. I noticed the new page others created and was delighted. I did however make one addition and added insurance. This is a major issue for transgender persons especially everywhere; access to medical care free from discrimination ;)  

'Legislative History' and 'Fiscal Notes' external links added today to HB 2661 in regards to the historic legislature which passed here in WA State. This law includes a group of persons with unique needs and issues; Fiscal allocation/requests for support are relevant whereas civil rights law enforcement support is concerned.  

Just wanted to thank you for your continued efforts with HB 2661!  

Allie, i wanted to ask for your help with something. I uploaded an image and am not sure how to label it... please view my info page and you will see... I submitted a question to wiki but i know you are smart so i figured i'd ask you too ~   (ps. I love the new pic ;)
Fixed the problem! (and thanks ;) ) - ✍ 

I appreciate the assist with the image tag! I was admittedly stumped. Wiki is all about asking other people for help when you need it too ;) That is what in part, makes it so great to participate in!  
No problem at all ) Yep - WP is all about co-operation so just dig in and get editing! If you need any help on anything at all, just ask ) - ✍ 

 Hey 

Just wondering why you like Ireland so much. I live here and I hate it and I plan to emigr8 ASAP! 

 Hiyya. Dunno if you noticed but I emigrated last August (again!). This time, I've no plans on ever living in Ireland again - ✍ 
Oh Kul! So do u lyk it in California. Hey, do u know if u'd be able 2 rent an appartment in L.A. at the age of 16 there? Thanx  
You are welcome. I was looking at the pp page, and followed your link.  Nice pic. ;)  
Thank you! ) - ✍

 A """"hint of longing?"""", a """"HINT of longing?""""  It's more like an avalanche of teenage angst because your crush won't reciprocate! 

a melancholic song about unrequited love, especially because it’s all crescendo and no denouement: Listeners never find out if the main character actually gets her wish—much less if the person she’s confessing her love to actually feels the same way. “All I Want For Christmas Is You” is a one-sided confession of wants and desires, not a song describing or celebrating a consummated relationship. “Honestly, the lyrics, to me, come off as hopelessly sad,” Williems says.  “I’ve read the critical reception section of the song’s Wikipedia page, and I can’t help but think the critics weren’t really listening. One critic seems to claim there is a ‘hint of longing,’ which might be the understatement of the century.

If you wanted to get real bummed about it, I think the argument could be made that the song is denouncing the artificiality surrounding the spectacle of Christmas,” he continues. “Saying that you are so hung up on the negative of not being with one person on Christmas that you can’t embrace the joy of the holiday is really pretty sad, but also movingly honest for a pop Christmas song.

"Editing 

Edits on wiki improve by evolution: only the best survives. They become best by change after change after change. I find I make two kinds of edits. Ones which add content, and ones which improve language. I fancy I am quite good at writing smooth prose, but very often it is not possible to do this immediately. If I have a fact to insert or point to make, the primary thing is to make or insert it. Then someone else can smooth it along, or i may do so myself when I have more time, or after leaving the piece and re-reading it. It can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go, because you do not spot your mistakes. As to our last exchange in Severus Snape, yes I agree, I put in a clumsy statement, but I was trying to express a particular point. You improved the flow, but slightly altered my point.

"Musical Knowledge Altered 

Hi there,

Thanks for the message.
I have only altered music data which I'm 100% sure of, such as Roy Orbison pages, etc.  I've been collecting music data since July 1960, therefore have a high degree of knowledge where music is concerned.

Someone has mentioned to me a person with the sirname 'Derbyshire'.  I don't know anyone with the last name 'Derbyshire'.

I contributed to the Guiness Book of British Hit Singles and Albums for many years {you'll find my name - Russtti Gaynor - listed in many of the final copies, until Virgin took over in 2006.

Chatham County is one of the few school systems in the state to not offer a middle school football program.
One of the only cases of a rabid beaver ever attacking a human in the US occurred during a rabies outbreak at Jordan Lake in the mid 1990's.
A secret government facility termed by locals as the """"Big Hole"""" was operated north of Pittsboro till around 1996. It was said the site was a virtual concrete city built several stories into the ground. The facility was actually part of the Autovon system operated under government contract by AT&T.; The site has reportedly been closed due to the introduction of the Defense Switched Network.
The clock currently in the county courthouse was a recent addition added to the courthouse. It was reportedly in the original plans of the courthouse, but for some reason was left out during its original construction.
Even though Jordan Lake is held mostly in the county's borders, county residents get very little drinking water from the lake. Most of the water is currently being sold to Cary and areas of eastern Wake County. These contracts have forced the county to purchase water from neighboring counties to guarantee sufficient supply in the county water system.
Many people moving to the Research Triangle area choose to live in the county because of lower tax rates compared to neighboring counties.
The geographical center of North Carolina is said to be near the Gulf community south of Goldston. This is debated since it is also said the geographical center of the state is in Montgomery County.

 Gyroscopic Inertial Thrusters 

Interesting discussion. The greatest hindrance to discovery and invention is MENTAL INERTIA, and the treatment of science as though it is a dogmatic religion.
 
Can anyone cite an authority that made the ridiculous statement that angular accelerations and momentum can NOT be exchanged for linear accelerations and momentum?
 
Such claims were made by Edison, attempting to discredit Tesla's alternating current. Mass and momentum equations are remarkably similar to the math involving electronics.
 
Over 20 others repeated my experiments, converting angular accelerations into linear acceleration, passing pendulum, water, ice skid, and air table tests.
 
Conservation of energy is NOT violated, since energy is required to change the velocity or direction of the device.  While only small """"anomalous"""" amounts of thrust have been generated, the venemous nature of religion in the name of science has been VERY difficult to overcome.
 
""""Do NOT confuse me with facts and experiments that appear to violate a BASIC TENNANT of physics, it is IMPOSSIBLE, therefore I will disbelieve my lying eyes!"""" - is the too common reaction when any attempt is made to further this field of research.  This is inconvenient, and NOT helpful, especially when fanatics insist on erasing any facts that do not conform to their religious views of science.

 need update to 1st source, in lede: that src now says Multiregional took away RAO's formerly """"mainstream"""" status, in the book's 2012 edition.  Also: reasons to support a long ignored proposal to unlock the article. 

A new edition of The Essence of Anthropology (by McBride B, Haviland WE, Prins HEL, Walrath D) is available, dated 2012.  This article is still citing the 2009 edition of the same book.

Note that the new, 2012 edition says  on pg. 94:
""""Until 2010, the recent African origins hypothesis was the mainstream position. But when researchers from the Max Planck Institute released a study comparing the Neanderthal genome...the genetic evidence shifted to supporting the multiregional hypothesis.[19]""""

This article's statement of RAO being """"the most widely accepted model..."""" was relying on the outdated 2009 edition of this book having said, on pg. 90 of the 2009 edition, that RAO """"is"""" the """"mainstream"""" position; the sentence involving what is """"mainstream"""" was revised in the 2012 edition, to say that the evidence now """"supports"""" the multiregional hypothesis.

This article's first sentence should therefore read (edits are in italics): """"...dubbed the """"Out of Africa"""" theory, was the most widely accepted model describing the geographic origin and early migration of anatomically modern humans, until the Multiregional_origin_of_modern_humans gained favour.""""

-

Also, who has kept the article locked for years and what is their reason for why it is still locked? Are the sources for each of these competing hypotheses so dubious and disputed?

And did the pro-RAO vandal himself lock this article, and then quit WP, or has had his account suspended, or what?
Why else is there no response to complaints about this article being locked for such a long-term, but that the one who locked it has long ignored this article and cannot be trusted to lock articles (if he is even still a WP member)? Per the fact-based accusations that were raised in the above topics in this Talk page, it should be unlocked in order to add the discoveries (I'd say """"recent discoveries,"""" except that 2010 isn't recent, which again exhibits that nobody holding a WP account is responsible enough to be trusted with the locking of this article, especially not an anthropologist or even anthro student, because if this article had even one expert editor, he should recognise immediately that the above edit requests are from veracious sources and are the reasons for the requests are explained explicitly enough that anyone worth their salt should comprehend what's being requested).

Others posing this question about why this article is locked have been unanswered for roughly a year, so who locked this article, then ignored this badly neglected, scientifically outdated article, for so long? And ironically, the people who want it unlocked are desiring to update this article with recent facts, i.e. discoveries, that refute RAO, so obviously none of us are the pro-RAO vandal, but this article was locked for years (literally) even before that complaint of a list of edits by a pro-RAO vandal was raised on the Talk page, again raising my question: Did the pro-RAO vandal make his edits to corrupt the veracity of this article, and then skip town, so to speak? 209.97.203.60  """,0

My discussion went off on a tangent with Malik Shabazz when it really should have included you as well. The Jean Claude Baker book on Josephine Baker seems biased and unacceptable. For example, he states at the beginning that he """"hated her"""" and refers to himself eighteen times on the first page.

The blanket statement """"Baker was bisexual,"""" written as if it indisputable, really has to go, don't you think?

Tiamut on the other hand has one agenda, and one agenda only; to push a Palestinian POV. I'm sorry to say, but your trying to put her in a good light rings hollow. Please check out what many other editors have said about her and then tell me if you still think so. Sorry I cannot sit back and watch you trying to equate us. By equating us you are actually smearing my character and exonerating her which is really not fair. It seems to me that she cannot do any bad and I cannot do very much good; that's the impression I get from your comments.

Here are some things you say which I find incorrect or disturbing. The reason I am calm is because I have given up on her, given up on the mediators, and almost given up on Wikipedia. Only people who think that they can win or accomplish something are passionate in what they do. I'll talk straight and pull no punches. I made my comment on your page only to show you that Tiamut is lying, in the belief that maybe you’ll open your eyes. Tiamut hasn't gotten under my skin at all; I know what she is up to and want to stop it; but if you (not you necessarily) will try to stop me instead of her, then I'll bid all of you good bye and let you have what you deserve. I have no softer way of putting it, that I just can't take this crap that Tiamut thought it reasonable to add """"nation"""" to the opening paragraph. No, she knows exactly what she is doing and such comments are what lets her get away with it. While Tiamut has lost her temper many times; I haven't lost my temper even once; disappointed, yes; lost temper, no. You say that you're surprised that Tiamut didn't go to the talk page earlier; I wonder why you're surprised; don't you see that she first tries to get away with whatever she can, then she'll engage in talk with no intention of compromising but to get part of her pushing accepted and put off the rest for another round. You say that I started my conversation with a negative touch by its heading of POV pushing. My purpose is not anymore to set her straight, which I have already given up. My purpose is to point out her POV pushing to all of you. Actually I think that I'm treating her with kid gloves compared to how administrators would have dealt with her, if they only wanted to. Lastly I completely object to your equating us both as edit warring. When one side explains, but the other side says one thing on the talk page and does something else on the article; then the explainer shouldn't be labeled an edit warier simply to be able to play the equation game. Please get it straight; I am an honest editor and she is a POV pusher, and the twain doesn't meet. She needs to be admonished not mediated; you cannot mediate with someone who will only play the game of mediation with no intention of good faith editing.

Her response to you is a game which allows her to do what she wants while she is engages in dilly-dallying and in false placation. Tiamut has learned to play a game with all of you. She pretends to engage in discussion but in reality does what she wants and then has the audacity to reverse the sequence of events to make it look as if she thought she was doing the right thing. Now watch her threaten that she will report me; that's also part of her game, and if she succeeds then Wikipedia doesn’t deserve any better.   

It's time to call a spade a spade; because otherwise Wikipedia will lose its valuable editors and stay with the crap. I’m really fed up with Wikipedia, and ready to bid everyone farewell.

Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your """"seen in the above insulting comments"""" which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say """"where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". Why do you think that """"Einstein, Landau and Feynman"""" are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned """"world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture.

 If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier. 

 If I'm wrong (you don't believe that there is a God) then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis (actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we can't discuss it anymore). So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one. Advice to BB folks: state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you won't need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you. Otherwise you'll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein, Landau and Feynman since they don't understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have.

BI, you said you wanted to talk

At the bottom of the lead section you have written:

""""Its promoter speculated in 1994 that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator, but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts. In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed """"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials"""".""""

Regarding:  In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed """"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials""""

That statement appears to come from Ref [3] on page 10.  The full quote is

""""If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload,
then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly
feasible using presently available materials, although the application might become feasible in
the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher
operational temperatures.""""

It then goes on to say

""""As we shall see, presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL
tethers needed. The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is:
“We don't need magic materials like ‘Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes’ to make
the space tether facility for a HASTOL system. Existing materials will do.”""""

So it would appear that you misread your reference.  The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem.  Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with """"presently available commercial materials.""""

To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states

""""The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is
technically feasible. We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will
allow hypersonic air-breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting, spinning space
tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into
Earth orbit. For more than one HASTOL architecture concept, we have developed a design
solution using existing, or near-term technologies. We expect that a number of the other
HASTOL architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to
detailed design studies. The systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically
reducing the cost of Earth-to-orbit space access.""""

Regarding: """"but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts."""" and 

""""A 2000 Boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that """"In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts."""".""""

In another supposed The New York Times article that used the same hoax clipping image it was claimed that aXXo, aka John Burningham, was killed in a traffic accident on the Interstate 95. The sources of those hoaxes are unknown.

Veroncia interview

In another interview on August 4, 2008 in Dublin, Ireland, a person named """"Veronica"""", supposedly a reporter for a major but unspecified computing magazine, learns that aXXo consists of two male individuals, one from Wales, the other from Poland.ISO PDF
Removing other names
The above have been removed because of lack of eliable sources as per WP:RS.  Initially I had also removed them but I thought Dr-Victor-von-Doom made a valid point:

But I also see that getting this article legit, involves cutting away all this internet rumor.  Even though aXXo is just that internet rumor.    
 Yeah. It's a bit painful cutting back all that information, but if we can start from scratch with only reliable sources, then this article is better off.  (talk) """,0

"Blocked==
I have been blocked for responding to KimDabelsteinPetersen's ongoing assaults on Global Warming skeptic articles:

Exposing your arguments as being specious and hypocritical is entirely relevant to stopping the BLP violating assaults that you and Connolley and others in your cabal have carried out. If you're serious about the sourcing standards that you're arguing for, then please apply them equally to all articles in this topic instead of gunning for subjects that you disagree with. You behavior is entirely inappropriate and enormously damaging to Wikipedia. 

The issue was the repeated removal of large sections of sourced content, reverted by several editors. The deletion included removal a statement that Lawrence Solomon is a columnist for the National Post. 

I have no idea why Stephan Shulz, Dabelstein, and Will Connolley have been allowed to continue their POV pushing rampage and are free to continue their efforts to disparage those they disagree with by the smearing them in their biographies. I have no objection to the inclusion of properly sourced criticism, but their use of innuendo, and specious arguments for gutting content and coattracking smears is unacceptable. It is very ironic that at a time when a deletion rampage against unreferenced biographies is going on these editors and their admin allies are allowed to violate our core principles and continue to abuse wikipedia for propaganda purposes. 

I would also note that I was given no warning and no opportunity to amend my comment, if in fact there is soemthign objectionable in it. If someone felt it was inappropriate I would be happy to address that. But once again we have tool abuse by incompetent and dishonest admins who see themselves as being above the rules. It's grotesque.

However I believe that JamesJJames has launched a personal attack on myself.

"The Bogdanov affair is the whole affair and not one article!!!
You just try to found reasons to shut me up and abuse your status as admi to do so but ain't not better than YBM.
You are doing exactly the same as him.
Why do you remove my answer TO YOUR ARTICLE from the main frame and let the answer made by YBM and others for exemple?
This is clearly discrimination.
My answer is all too relevant to the affair discussed as are all my article as the last ones have to do with the crdibility of the people who have been the upmost against the Bogdanovs and have critisize their theory the most.
I do not think that a DEA in informatic make a person capable to critisize the work of professionals in theorethic Physic. To do so you will have to be Stephen W Hawking and the alike.
I have pointed how discusting the methods of YBM were and was able to come with tangibles prooves of it.
Thats why he hurried to deleet them.
But you came, afet 6 days he had done that and 6 days I tried to put it back, and...banished me!!!
then after 9 days in all, you wrote your first intervention in this site and gave a warning to YBM, but.. you failled to punish him as well, and you commited the grave mistake to accuse me of having perpetrated the same kind of crime as he did, and by doing so, bagatelize the incident as being a commun little fight between 2 stupid users deleting each others column.
But it isn't at all what happened.
My answer to your intervention, more than being an internal dispute, had as goal to put things back where they belong, and regarded all users.
They have to know that this YBM did deleeted my texts for a whole week, without any admin interventions, that you did bannished me but not him, and that you did bannished me again but not him, for personal reasons, and at the same time hinder the users to see the facts by removing them from where they belong and place them outside.
You don not have answered any of my questions, and for you to know Cereal Killer is the admi of the french site about the bogdanov affair and is therefor very relevant to this case.
As for your accusation of my pseudo crimes of having written in french, I wrote in french on heat after having read your answer, and translated it dtraight away in english, and the french version was no more than 10 to 15 minutes on line in the middle of the night, so do stop try to agress with lies, be more honnest with yourself, at least and say it as it is: you prefer the opinion of YBM, do not like the Bogdanov, thought you do not understand a thing about astrophysic, and you feel nothing but hatress and repulsion about me and what I stand for.
i do not think that an aristrocats fan is welcome in a place like wiki who require essentially people having a great sens of honnor, democratie, equality, common sens, and who value ethic.
That rules you out, as action speak louder than any words could ever do.

"User Kannambadi, please do not try to frighten and justify blocks on me.  Did the person who blocked me on two occasions (first of all I do know, it was you and your other friends who cannot tolerate a counter opinion, who prompted the irresponsible blocking on the previous occasions.... you are again giving a seemingly sage advice for first discussing before carrying out edits.... do you remember what you told the user (I forget his name, but he was from Maharashtra)?  You wrote: I borrow from Kamath, you go and get it from a good library. I have a good library near my home and town, where the book is available. Thus, you left it all on the person countering YOUR opinion to prove otherwise.... Why not do the same thing this time around?  

I have indeed borrowed from two books called Ancient India, one by K.A.N.Sastri and R.C.Roychowdhuri. These are two books of the same name by the above named two authors with Roychowdhuri borrowing extensively from Sastri.  I also think that the book by K.A.N.Sastri is dated 1959 while the one of Roychowdhury is either 1951 or 1961, probably it is 1961 edition.  Roychowdhuri's book is quite different from the edition of the same book available on the internet at books.google.com/.

Please also try preaching the same to the irresponsible user who blocked me in that he should also have practiced what you are preaching me.... that is first indulge in a discussion before taking action to block contributors like me. Did he do that? He simply barged into my page like a bull in the china shop and blindly commented that I have made personal commentary on the Chola page and hence he was blocking me.  This after I had painstakingly borrowed from noted epigraphist Huntzsh's summary of the rule of the Chola empire where he had sought to dispel the notions that they were devout Saivites by saying that during the rule of the second Chola king i.e. Aditya I itself, two temples i.e. the Siva Temple of Chidambaram and the one at Srirangam being a Vishnu temple and regarded the most important Siva and Vishnu temples, were both declared as Kuladhanam (family heritage sites) for the Chola kings (ordaining in a way that the kings of this dynasty one after another will look personally after the upkeep of traditions at both the temples and their well being). Indeed, I made the mistake of not quoting Prof. Huntzsh (again courtesy the site you love to deride calling it a POV website despite using it to support points on Chalukyas and Hoysalas) but on my very next visit on the same day, I found that the 'department of dirty tricks' had prompted Blinguen to block me for the second time. Does Blinguen have any knowledge at all of Indian history, most of all of the history of the Cholas, Hoysalas or Pandiyans and most of all of your beloved Chalukya Cholas?  Certainly I would have loved to engage him on a one to one debate on Indian history especially that of South India.  I also wrote to Taprobanus wanting to prosecute Blinguen and requested for his address.  

It is a shame that cowards contacted him it seems on the email or on phone to complain about me, but no one ever wrote about it in the open, no one contacted me and most of all no one ever wanted to discuss the matter. Rather, people who scarcely contributed to the Chola page like user Earth etc. started advocating this and that.  Mind you, user Earth himself was adviced by another admin when he complained about me that the contributions made by me were in good faith only, but it seems ultimately the dirty gang on wikipedia bent upon converting it into some sort of monkeypedia finally had their say.

What you basically always do is you want to write and not just that, you want whatever you write to be retained at all costs, but in the process, you forget counter opinions by other historians as well.  K.A.N.Sastri has written in his book (as opposed to what you wrote quoting Kamath that Satyasraya defeated crown prince Rajendra), that Rajendra Chola defeated Satyasraya (he wrote something like: next was the turn of Satyasraya who fled the battlefield near the fields of Hottur-??) and hid in the jungles of Kogali and Kadambalige.  I would say 'exactly' for you find among the limited number of inscriptions available of Satyasraya (courtesy: the site you always try to trash inscriptions.whatsindia.com/) which are indeed found at Kogali and Kadambalige and in fact in a couple of these inscriptions Satyasraya even is called as 'ruling from Kadambalige'. Kindly access this information in the same manner as I have done and exactly in the same manner as you expect others to do, i.e. access appropriate information from appropriate sources.   Even in this, I do not want to claim whatever I say is correct, indeed if Satyasraya is attributed by Kamath with victory over Rajendra then kindly also quote other sources where Rajendra claims victory over the Chalukyas including the most important Wo",0

 Template:Infobox WRC driver/sandbox 

dHi Pelmeen. I saw your message at WT:RALLY regarding an updated version of the WRC driver infobox template. I've taken a look and I have some suggestions:
 Instead of calling it """"Infobox WRC driver"""", we should call it """"Infobox Rally driver"""". Although not often, we are beginning to cover drivers from IRC, ERC and other notable rally drivers who aren't WRC drivers.
 There shouldn't be a reason for both of the name= and fullname= fields, one should suffice (This is a fault with the current template, also)
 Instead of calling the next section of the infobox """"World Rally Championship record"""", there should be an additional field that the editor can choose options of WRC, IRC, ERC, etc etc so that we can use this infobox on other rally drivers
 The co-driver= field should be made clear in the """"doc"""" page that this shouldn't be used just for the current co-driver, especially if the drivers' previous co-drivers are notable and have Wikipedia articles
 Same for teams=
 The races= field, which is generated in the Rallies line of the infobox  it's unclear what this is for perhaps change it to races-number= or even better, add an additional field rallies-number=, tell users in the doc that """"races"""" is depreciated and """"rallies"""" is preferred (because the output is """"Rallies"""")
 I'm not sure that the points= field is necessary. What importance is is that Sebastien Loeb, for example, has won 1133 in his career? We only care about the current season. There is no championship for total points, and because the length of each drivers' career is different, it's not really comparable between different drivers
 I'm interested in seeing the medaltemplates= field in use. What is this for?
Hope these comments help, I'll watch the sandbox with interest for additional updates.    Chat   """,0

His second arrest, with brother Buck Barrow, came soon after — this time for possession of stolen goods (turkeys).

:

 Sandstein apparently thinks that everything not being a compliment is ipso facto derogatory. There is also another possibility that hasn't crossed his mind: neutral. No English dictionary has (derogatory) or (offensive) label next to the definition of the word nationalist. However, in Sandstein's native language the word nationalist does have a derogatory undertone. Here is the link to the definition of Nationalismus in the most authoritative German dictionary (Duden), where it has a label (meist abwertend) which translates into English as """"mostly pejoratively"""". In German it's used as a pejorative, in English it isn't and it belongs to the neutral register. I suspect that Sandstein mixed two entirely different usage contexts for otherwise related words with the same meaning, in two different languages.
 It was not my intention to make any kind of personal attack. If you look at my edit history you can see that my behavior has been nothing short of exemplary. I have never heard anyone complaining about being offended by calling them nationalist. More often than not, it is I who is on the receiving end of abuse which sometimes provokes abrasive responses. If someone said that they are offended I would've stopped.
 Sandstein's condescending comment about me apparently failing to understand something (what?), justifying the """"educational"""" component of the block by such lack of understanding is borderline insulting. Perhaps Sandstain trains his dog by taking punitive measures when puppy does something wrong, but may I remind him that we're dealing with human actors here that are not Fachidioten with blinders that only respond to Pavlovian stimuli dispensed by the master with his block^Wstick. An administrator should not be making such comments when blocking other users. They shouldn't probably be thinking of editors as offenders that ought to be subject to corrective measures (blocks) for their infractions (policy violations), but at least they could keep it to themselves.
 OK, let's say I crossed the line with nationalist name-calling. I didn't mean to use derogatorily, but I can accept that it is not an appropriate conduct. But what does that have to do with ARBMAC and the excessively long block? As I far I can see the guidelines on the WP:PA require posting a message on user's talkpage and seeking mediation. None of that happened. PA is a community-approved policy which takes precedence over anything ArbCom decides, or any admin """"broadly interprets"""". A week is something that trolls and bad-faith editors get. Surely it's too excessive?
 This whole circus is a result of content dispute with the user who submitted the enforcement request. It was not made in good faith and his ulterior goal is to remove me from editing a set of low-importance articles that are currently not in a NPOV state. He also submitted a sockpuppet investigation against me with evidence such as last-year's sarcastic comment of mine on a sister project, as well as edits that I made years ago. With all that in mind, I must say that Wikipedia community has become very effective at giving partisan editors tools to target undesirable editors - a Byzantine collection of policies which admins overzealously enforce without a second thought, and without thinking of a big picture. Admins in fact are incentivized not to involve themselves, which basically gives the enforcement gun to POV-pushers which are intimately acquainted with all the glorious details of the relevant wikilese. I urge admins to think outside the policy-enforcing request-observing mode and think whether blocking me in any way helps to resolve the pending content disputes.   """,0

PCID apparently published the CTMU paper despite its clear affirmation of evolution because ISCID is tired of being accused of having a """"Creationist"""" agenda and therefore wishes to display open-mindedness. Presumably, this is also why Langan was invited to be a Fellow of that organization. Whether or not those who rule over ISCID have a Creationist agenda is not the issue here; all that matters is that (1) they say they don't, which means that Langan is not embracing Creationism by being an ISCID Fellow; and (2) that the CTMU in fact accommodates evolution, as Langan has repeatedly stated.

 WIKIPEDIA IS ! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

Likewise, we have Emperor Taishō and not """"Yoshihito of Japan"""", and similar for all of the 100+ other deceased emperors of Japan.

If wikipedia is to be a meaningful reference and encyclopedia, it should promote usage of the """"most correct"""" term over what some people may feel is """"most common"""".

WRT """"innocent""""  this is not a """"verified fact"""".  
 Does the Chinese government agree they are """"innocent""""?  No.
 The DoJ appealed Urbina's ruling on Razakah's habeas.  Did they think he is """"innocent""""?
 Urbina wasn't ruling on Razakah's """"innocence"""".  None of the habeas rulings were on whether the captives were """"innocent"""" of a crime.  None of the Uyghurs were charged with a crime.  All of the habeas rulings were on whether the """"preponderance of the evidence"""" supported the Executive Branch claim that it was justified to hold them because the were enemies of the USA, or had supported al Qaeda.

The first Uyghur to get a ruling was Huzaifa Parhat.  His 2008-06-20 ruling was in the only DTA appeal to run to conclusion.  The Executive Branch considered appealing that ruling.  The Executive Branch had a schedule of when it had to file factual returns in the Uyghurs' habeas cases.  The Uyghur's factual returns were due in October.  In those factual returns they would have been obliged to lay out valid evidence to justify the Uyghur's detention.  It is important to quote our sources accurately.  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were """"innocent"""".  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were not, after all, """"enemy combatants"""".  The DoJ simply said that they were changing their plans, and would not put forward arguments that the Uyghurs were """"enemy combatants"""".  Some commentators went on record as interpreting this change of plans not as an acknowledgment that the Uyghurs weren't enemies, but merely as a strategic decision that the value of establishing that the Uyghurs were enemy combatants was insufficient to justify making classified sources public.

Personally, I agree, that the Uyghurs were wrongfully imprisoned.  But I understand that personal opinions like that don't belong in article space.  The wikipedia is not supposed to be used for advocacy.  We shouldn't rewrite history to improperly imply the Uyghur's """"innocence"""" has been an established fact.
As I have explained to you before, if you find Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine quotes Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine, in summarizing Urbina's ruling, uses that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  attributed to the WP:RS, not to Urbina.
If you find Urbina's ruling, and he used a different phrase, like, """"...the USA has no legal justification to hold Razakah..."""", you are stuck using that phrase, even if other judges used the phrase """"wrongfully imprisoned"""" in other habeas rulings.

WRT where to find the DoJ's appeal...  A reference to the CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard was offered right in the paragraph where I added that the ruling in his habeas was appealed.  The CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard has a column for whether a habeas ruling was appealed.  That column in Razakah's entry says his ruling was appealed.  I urge you to double check references more carefully before claiming assertions were unreferenced.

WRT his """"innocence"""", you assert above: """"There is hardly anybody now who doubt this...""""  this is an argument based on common knowledge.  Further, your draft asserted that their innocence was established """"early"""".  We don't base our articles on common knowledge, or our personal opinions as to what is common knowledge, we base them on what we can verify from authoritative reliable sources.    """,0

"Hello James , it seems that the banned sock puppet account of that religious User from Pakistan is back  

Hello James , i have to contact you directly , because i don t want to start a war edit . I do believe that user Rahtujabi from Pakistan ( or he was called something like that because i do not remember the name exactly ) that you have banned multiple times operating multiple sock puppet accounts in order to promote a religious extremist agenda , is back again . I had contacted you some time ago( 3 months ago aproximately) when he was vandalizing the article about Albania , with 3 sock puppet accounts , and you banned him and all his sock puppet accounts . 

Please can you check the connection of users >  Mingling2 ,  رائد عزمي حموده  , 79.112.121.127 . 

These 3 users did the exact same edit to avoid the 3 reverts rule , they all seem to be preocupied with religious matters on global scale based on their contributions history . 

As demonstrated here > Revision as of 10:44, 18 February 2014 by رائد عزمي حموده , Revision as of 15:11, 20 February 2014 by 79.112.121.127 , Revision as of 15:59, 21 February 2014 by  Mingling2 . All these users are making the same revert in a timespan of 2 days . Their contributions history is also only about religion ... ! 

Second revert that now Mingling2 is trying to do , is remove a Sourced , very valuable image within its historical context that is located there ... ! Why would this be somehow connected to a religious matter ? The answer is because SKANDERBEG , the national hero of Albania , was a christian ( as the whole population of Albania before getting occupied by the muslim ottomans ) that fought the ottomans and won countless of times , until his death . After his death , the ottomans did occupy the whole albania , and made by force a part of its population muslim ... So thats where the connection is . By hiding one of the most important battles of Albania against the ottomans , he wants to hide this fact .

Revision as of 15:55, 23 February 2014 by Mingling2 . 

His ridiculous explanation of removing an established , very important , very relevant and sourced image , that has always been there as per consensus with previous users,  which is DIRECTLY connected with the ottoman period in Albania , is non Standing in any way shape or form . 

This guy is user Rasturhabji , i am betting my everything on that .

 Misleading reference to study? 

In the section on lead paint in art (which I largely wrote), someone added the following:

""""Lead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. This is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids, often from fingerprints. [2] As a result, many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.""""

As I found this surprising, I went and carefully read the study being cited. Their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper, although that wasn't absolutely clear. But lead paint is almost never used that way! Artists working in transparent watercolor (aquarelle) don't usually use white paint, or just occasionally a bit of """"Chinese White"""" (not lead) to make corrections. And opaque watercolors (gouache) and acrylic (polymer) artist's paints typically use titanium dioxide or (rarely) zinc white, but never lead. Normally """"flake white"""" is used only by oil painters, and there's no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. Cooperstown is a well-respected institution, but as of now I'm sticking with the classic (Ralph Mayer). Flake white may get *slightly* yellowish after centuries, but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above. If someone has more information on this, please mention it here; otherwise when I come back I'm going to delete that paragraph or water it down (no pun intended).""",0

 INCONSISTENCIES 

On the two narratives of the Creation Story (Gen. 1:1-2:4a and 2:4b-25), please notice the following inconsistencies:
a. In the first narrative, man was created on the sixth day where man the last of God's creation. On the second narrative, notice that man was first to be created.
b. In the first narrative, all other creatures (birds, fishes, animals, plants, etc.) created before the creation of man where man created at the same time; both Adam and Eve while in the second narrative, note that Adam was first to be created then followed by the garden in Eden and then by the animal creatures. When none proved to be the suitable partner for man, it was only then that Eve was created where Eve the last to be created.
c. In the second narrative, the LORD GOD used the possessive pronoun I (""""I will make a suitable partner for man"""") while in the first narrative, when GOD created man, GOD said """"Let US create man...""""
d. Note that in the first narrative, God created all things using His word (Let there be...) while in the second narrative, Lord God created all creatures including man """"out of the (clay of the) ground"""".
e. In the first narrative, everyday of creation was always concluded with the phrase """"God saw (his creation) that it was good"""" while on the second narrative, the Lord God said """"IT IS NOT GOOD for man to be alone"""" considering it is He himself who created the man that is alone. Believe it or not, it is was a mistake. It then brings us to inquiring whether or not the creation of EVE in the original plan when the narrative suggests that had God did not mistakenly created man to be lonely, Eve could not have been created. Note further that the first choice of the Lord God to be the partner of man was animals. Upon notice of man's loneliness, God created different animals (2:19)and the purpose of their creation is to present them to Adam for man to choose which of those animals he may like be his suitable partner. Eve was actually the second choice after Adam rejected animals. Hence the question again, does God know what he was doing? It seems the creation process a matter of TRIAL AND ERROR. And true enough, EVE is a product of ERROR.
e. Bible scholars are one in the agreement that the second narrative was written way ahead of the first narrative. Gen 2 (the second story of creation) is therefore the original creation story. But why was it written A POSTERIORI the first narrative. Please consider the same parallel confusion of sequence in the first two books of the New Testament. Mark is an older Gospel than Matthew but chronology seem to follow the same confusion between the two stories of creation in the book of Genesis. 

 IRREGULARITIES 
a. On the first day of creation, God created LIGHT. On the fourth day, God separated the light that guides the day from the light that guides the night and all other stars and heavenly bodies. Question is; when did God created the SUN? Was it on the first or the fourth day. If it's the latter, what light did He create on the first day?
b. It is not correct to call the garden Eden. The correct text states (2:8) """"LORD GOD planted a garden in Eden"""". Eden is the place where the garden was planted and not the garden itself. The narrative even mentioned the location of the garden being """"East of Eden"""".
c. Note that in the 2:5, it was stated """"the Lord God had not sent RAIN upon the earth"""". Question: when was rain created?
d. Please check the absurd narrative of Chapter 6 about the Nephilim. SONS OF GOD marrying daughters of man and producing sons who were the heroes of the past and the popular men?"""" Huhhh?
e. It seems disenchanting to consider God a SUPREME ALL POWERFUL BEING but possesses the human frailty of REGRET; (6:6) And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
f. NOTE: GEN 1, the creator was GOD. In GEN 2 and 3, it was the LORD GOD. In 4 to 50, its the LORD.

Signature
Hi, per WP:SIG, sigs with text larger than the default size are not reccomended [sic]. Please could you change your sig?  (contribs)  
After fruitlessly testing this with successively smaller font sizes, I removed the sup/sup markup for my talk link.  It was the talk link, superscripted as many  wikipedians also choose to place theirs (cf. 's on my Archive 1 subpage), which was making my signature appear to be significantly larger than default size.
I am treating your complaint as seriously as I would that of a registered user.  I do recommend that you register.
I don't, of course, include the talk link in my sig for messages on my talk page (this one).  
I can't help but notice your signature—you've set it in a very large type size.  I appreciate that many users like to spruce up their signatures to make them unique, but such modifications are usually limited to adding colour and symbols.  Using such a large font is very distracting, as it makes your signature seem much more important than the surrounding text, and also breaks up line spacing.  I hope you'll take this observation under advisement and consider changing your signature to something a little less outstanding. —

"Mysideae asked me to comment here in my volunteer capacity. I do not know anything about this topic, but looking at the Criticism section of the current article, it appears to all be reflective of specific time-periods and therefore belongs in the History section. A dedicated Criticism section is not a neutral title and draws undue attention to the criticisms. Though you could also look at it the other way, that they are buried at the bottom and belong near the top.

As for the draft, I see there are some nice plugs for Moodys, that are especially heavily cited and have substantial weight. Well... I wrote the article on History of public relations and it mentions some PR agencies that played a role in its history, so this is not unprecedented. However, I am concerned about the weight of this material and whether it is fair to other agencies. 

I think the draft is valuable enough as a starting point for it to be worth our attention, but I would suggest an editor do some light research independently, trim, copyedit and re-write it and mix it with the current Criticisms section into a more balanced History.  (Talk)",0

 Self Contradictory and Unsourced 

The fundamental premise of this article is self-contradictory.

To summarize the definition given here: 

A """"hate group"""" is a group of people with an ideology that expresses opposition to other people with a particular characteristic, practice or belief system.

People who define """"hate groups"""" as ethically bad and which should be opposed or suppressed, are themselves a """"hate group"""", since by their own definition they are opposed to groups of people with a certain ideology, and often advocate government suppression of hate groups via the criminal code.

The recent coining and popularization of the term """"hate group"""" is a propaganda device using """"highly charged words"""" used by one ideological group to demonize a group holding an opposite ideology.  

Note, for example the Anti Defamation League mentioned on this page.  ADL is a group dedicated to the defense of Jewish people and culture, and has often worked to pass laws to suppress anti-Jewish ideological groups.  Arab and Muslim groups, on the other hand, refer to the ADL as a """"hate group"""" while themselves advocating the abolition of the State of Israel, etc.

Additionally the definition of hate group used here is not sourced.

In the pursuit of NPOV, it would be better to write this article about the use of the term """"hate groups"""" as a propaganda device, rather than allow Wikipedia to become a conduit of such propaganda.69.19.14.35  """,0

Many thanks for checking and investigating. It is a shame there's nothing more recent. From p23 of Curatolo(2003), """"Diagnosic Criteria"""", I get:
The rate of occurrence of tuberous sclerosis at birth is unknown...(paragraph continues with stats trying to come up with a figure)... This indicates that the real incidence at birth may be as high as 1:6000 (Webb et al. 1993, Cardiac rhabdomyomas and their association with tuberous sclerosis, Arch Dis Child 68:367–70)

Earlier, when talking about Hunt and Lindenbaum's 1984 study, he says """"The scientists believed that the birth prevalence might be even higher than it is now considered to be."""" I don't have that paper so don't have more details.

An editorial by Fryer (Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 1991, 84:699) says """"... suggesting a birth incidence of 1:10000"""". I don't have the Osborne paper you mention. I've seen 1:5800 mentioned but don't know its source at present.

My sources seem to use incidence and prevalence interchangeably wrt to birth. I'm happy to change it if you think it may be less ambiguous.

The list of prevalence figures throughout the years comes from Curatolo (2003), Table 2.6, page 22. This in turn is based on an earlier table by Shepherd in his short chapter """"The Epidemiology of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex"""" in the book Gomez 1999.

I didn't write the sentence about the biblical references, I merely supplied them. I don't remember who  wrote the sentence.  However, a federal circuit court, wrote, (one of my deleted references):

The following was excerpted from Iannaccone v. Law, 142 F.3d 553 (2d Cir. 1998):

The right to proceed pro se in civil actions in federal courts is guaranteed by 28 U.S.C. § 1654, which provides: """"In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as, by the rules of such courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" Section 1654's guarantee derives directly from the Judiciary Act of 1789.

First introduced in the Senate on June 12, 1789 as part of Senate Bill [S-1], the right to self-representation appeared in section 31 of the Bill. But when the Bill became law, on September 24, 1789, the right was moved to section 35, which reads as follows: """"That in all the Courts of the United States the Parties may plead and manage their own causes personally or by the assistance of such Counsel or Attornies at law as by the rules of the said Courts respectively shall be permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" V Documentary History of the First Federal Congress of the United States of America 1789-1791 1150, 1165, 1193 (1986). As can be seen, the right to self-representation has remained constant for over 200 years.

The framers of our Constitution thought self-representation in civil suits was a basic right that belongs to a free people. Although the Supreme Court alluded to civil pro se representation in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 812-13 (1975), the Court there focused its discussion on the right to represent oneself as a defendant in a criminal case, id. at 813 et seq., which the Constitution's Bill of Rights guarantees.

In a criminal prosecution, a pro se party of course may only appear as a defendant. In a civil case, a person may appear pro se as either a plaintiff or defendant. And, as noted, the right of self-representation in one case is protected by the Constitution, and in the other, simply by statute. Further, in contrast to criminal defendants, civil litigants unable to afford counsel cannot ordinarily obtain appointment of counsel, except in circumstances when there is a risk of loss of liberty, as in mental commitment or juvenile delinquency proceedings. See H.B. Kim,Legal Education For the Pro Se Litigant: A Step Towards a Meaningful Right to Be Heard, 96 Yale L. J. 1641, 1646-47 (1987).

Moreover, the historical origins of self-representation in civil and criminal proceedings are different. In Faretta, the Court discussed the historic requirement of having counsel, going back to the infamous English Star Chamber that forced counsel upon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding, and the requirement's gradual reform. This reform was fervently embraced in colonial America for those accused of crime. See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 821-26.

Passing from the criminal to the civil context, we . . . observ[e] that a person appearing pro se in federal court can be a mixed blessing because persons appearing pro se lack legal training and may, on occasion, burden the court by filing illogical or incomprehensible pleadings, affidavits and briefs. And sometimes a pro se litigant appears simply for the purpose of using the courtroom to advance a political or social agenda, or to pursue a matter that is legally unredressable. See E.J.R. Nichols, Preserving Pro Se Representation in an Age of Rule 11 Sanctions, 67 Tex. L. Rev. 351, 351 nn.2 & 3 (1988). Yet, even given those potential burdens, there still remains a citizen's right of access to the courts, a strongly held notion stretching back to the beginnings of our Republic. The origins of the right to appear for oneself in civil proceedings derive from a number of sources, all deeply rooted in our history and culture. We undertake to discuss briefly five of those sources, though doubtless there are others:

First, history. Under the English common law with its complicated forms of action and veritable maze of writs and confusing procedures, the right to retain counsel in civil proceedings became a necessity. By the middle of the thirteenth century, lawyers so monopolized the courts in London that the King was forced to decree that, except for a few special causes, litigants were entitled to plead their own cases without lawyers. See The Right to Counsel in Civil Litigation, 66 Colum. L. Rev. 1322, 1325 (1966).

Second, mistrust of lawyers made appearance in court without benefit of counsel the preferred course. See A.L. Downey, Note, Fools and Their Ethics: The Professional Responsibility of Pro Se Attorneys, 34 B.C. L. Rev. 529, 533 (1993). Lawyers had no position of honor or place in society in early colonial days. The pioneers who cleared th",0

How this article can shine

A big problem here is the lack of references.   Even stuff that is true needs a reference, cause how is the rest of the world going to know whether someone just made it up?

Here are ways to combat this:

 Use information from the school's website.   Yes, the school's website sucks, but there is some info there.
 Use information from the local newspapers, the Trib, Chron, and other local publications.
 Use information from the school newspaper, yearbook, and literary journal.   The great thing about this is students can get things in here that otherwise would go underreported.   These all have editorial oversight so they are """"reliable"""" as far as wikipedia cares.   (unlike a student's blog)

 The only """"fights"""" I have with you are on talkpage discussions on which you persistently push pro-Croatian POV, disregarding and belittling important Serbian sources. Of course I'm going to pick those fights with you - if I don't do it nobody will. It's a topic of minor importance - not like Ustashi or Croatian language which have high exposure - so normal editors don't care and nationalists can numerically overwhelm and push their POV into those little articles.
 Yes it's either inability or disregard. In any case blocking someone for a week for calling someone a nationalist, and doing it by invoking a policy (ARBMAC) that doesn't even deal with personal conduct is a joke. If blocking admin doesn't understand that then he shouldn't be an admin. ARBMAC also seems fundamentally broken - created by a decree to give godlike powers to admins in arbitrary topics, and arbitrarily expanded in """"maintenance motions"""" (as one ArbCom member described it). It should be repelled because it's being abused by nationalist gangs who eagerly collect """"evidence"""" to block rare NPOV editors such as me or   """,0

 The McIntosh et al. 2013 study on rotational acceleration and bicycle helmets 

I have restored the reference to this study in the """"Rotational Injury"""" section of the article - someone had removed it and substituted a reference to a another study by McIntosh et al. which deals only with motorcycle helmets. Unfortunately, it seems the publisher has made a mistake and the McIntosh et al. paper and one other paper are missing from the online journal contents (you can see the gap in the page numbers for that issue). The corresponding author is endeavouring to have that corrected, but the paper does exist, I have seen a copy of it. It isn't indexed in PubMed yet either.  In the meantime, I will post of a copy of the abstract from the paper here:
ANDREW S. MCINTOSH, ADRIAN LAI and EDGAR SCHILTER. Bicycle Helmets: Head Impact Dynamics in Helmeted and Unhelmeted Oblique Impact Tests. Traffic Injury Prevention (2013) 14, 501–508. online DOI: 10.1080/15389588.2012.727217. 
Objective: To assess the factors, including helmet use, that contribute to head linear and angular acceleration in bicycle crash simulation tests.
Method: A series of laboratory tests was undertaken using an oblique impact rig. The impact rig included a drop assembly with a Hybrid III head and neck. The head struck a horizontally moving striker plate. Head linear and angular acceleration and striker plate force were measured. The Head Injury Criterion was derived. The following test parameters were varied: drop height to a maximum of 1.5 m, horizontal speed to a maximum of 25 km/h, helmet/no helmet, impact orientation/location, and restraint adjustment. Additional radial impacts were conducted on the same helmet models for comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics were derived and multiple regression was applied to examine the role of each parameter. 
Results: Helmet use was the most significant factor in reducing the magnitude of all outcome variables. Linear acceleration and the Head Injury Criterion were influenced by the drop height, whereas angular acceleration tended to be influenced by the horizontal speed and impact orientation/location. The restraint adjustment influenced the outcome variables, with lower coefficients of variation observed with the tight restraint. 
Conclusions: The study reinforces the benefits of wearing a bicycle helmet in a crash. The study also demonstrates that helmets do not increase angular head acceleration. The study assists in establishing the need for an agreed-upon international oblique helmet test as well as the boundary conditions for oblique helmet testing.

Edit 25 Nov 07
The anonymous editor immediately before me believed that they had """"deleted weasel words, tried to bring it back to a neutral perspective"""". The edit was a basic misunderstanding of the Secret History; I wouldn't be surprised if they hadn't read the work. The SH does indeed """"claim to"""" report, rather than """"report"""" scandals in Justinian's reign: the work remains completely uncorroborated by any other contemporary witness, and some of the purported scandals are so outrageous, the causes given by Procopius so bizarre and unknowable (viz., that Justinian was a devil and had the gift of invisibility), that much of it does not so much report anything as give vent to the bile of the author: that's why I let stand the deletion of """"apparently"""" (""""The Secret History apparently reveals an author who had become deeply disillusioned""""), since that particular word is a """"weasel word"""" on the part of some Wikipedia editor. But the so-called 'revelations' are indeed """"titillating (and doubtful)"""" rather than """"revealing"""" (and """"revealing revelations"""" is very bad copy editing, too). Similarly again, given that there is no doubt that the same author wrote both the SH and the Buildings, the panegyric of Justinian is undeniably insincere; since the Buildings bears the mark of official patronage in other respects, the panegyric can indeed be viewed as written at Justinian's behest, or something like it: stet. All of this is ground well traveled by the various editors of the work over the centuries, and represents the clear consensus of modern scholars.   """,0

 I  define ignosticism as the notion that as His attributes are incoherent and contradict each other, He is meaningless, conrary to my friend David Ramsay Steele who finds Him understandable. What I mean is that whilst one can fathom the  definitions of His attributes and Him, their incoherence really means that He means nothing.
 David states that had scientists resorted to verification, they'd have overlooked atoms and now- superstrngs,  but right before that he states in principle. Indeed, those two matters in principle were knowable whilst God defends on theologian's it must be's and guesses [ John Hick really guesses in dealing with the problem of evil1]. 
 I find as arguments for Him beg the question, such notions as First Cause are meaningless such that theistic arguments themselves affirm ignosticism or in this case, kake it igtheism.

Additionally the victimisation and probable threat on his life if his name is revealed also makes another case why his name shouldn't be there whether the name the sources gave might be wrong or true.

Image Tagging Image:Sangesar(A H)1.jpg

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Sangesar(A H)1.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

 true cooperation will likely never happen 

cooperation is asked for but is true cooperation asked for?

I don't have any problem with the NPOV rule.  I just see censorship over and over. Wikipedia is clear:

""""None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views. There is no size limit to Wikipedia. But even on such pages, though a view is spelled out possibly in great detail, we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth."""" 

Now I have wanted to have cooperation and have good faith efforts on both sides.  I have listened to the other side and taken feedback. I made some changes although admittedly not a lot.  

However, Cooperation may never happen.  Why?

Here is why:

1.  Does some person keep changing the theological conservative Christianity  internal link in the Biblical scientific foreknowledge (BSF) article so it goes to the Christian right (Falwell, etc).  Would a person who wants to act in good faith do that? 

2. Would people who act in good faith send harrassing messages (""""fundie"""" etc).  

I think the people calling for cooperation yet saying absolutely nothing publically about the bad behavior of certain  anti-BSF parties are not seeking true cooperation.  What they are asking for is the minority view be trampled despite the Wikipedia policy. 

 kdbuffalo

addendum
The Bible says the heart is deceitfully wicked above all things.  The above devious tactics are not a great surprise.   Now you can pretend that someone is not changing the conservative Christianity link to Christian right.   You can pretend MickWest is not harrassing me with messages to my userpage I said I did not want but that doesn't make it so.  You can choose not to view duncharris's userpage.  That is your choice but don't ask me to endorse it.  I am not going to.  I am not going to exist in LaLa land and pretend MickWest and Duncharris are reasonable.  They have shown they are not and it is likely not going to change.  I can adjust to this and recognize this matter.  I suggest you do the same. 

Now you say BSF is minority.  Does the Bible say the universe had a beginning?  Do scientist increasinng recognize this matter?  Do major medical historians recognize where the Bible was ahead of its time? Yes they do.   Now I cannot help people's ignorance regarding these matters but I am not going to let it decide for me my position.""",0

Rankings
At the beginning of October, substantial material was added which is mostly critical of the University's recent performance and advertising. With a few tweaks, this material has mostly been accepted on Wikipedia. However, the section on rankings has since then been subject to a slow edit war between the original anon and another. I reproduce the fuller version of the section below for discussion:
In 2010 QS World University Rankings ranked the University of Canterbury 189th overall in the world, making it the third highest ranked university in New Zealand. Its individual global subject rankings were: 212th in Arts & Humanities, 110th in Engineering & IT, 242nd in Natural Sciences, and 152nd in Social Sciences. In 2011 the University of Canterbury slipped from 189th to 212th in these rankings.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5569146/NZ-universities-lose-ground University loses ground. As the 2011 results were released, the University of Canterbury launched an advertising campaign in which the VIce Chancellor Dr Rod Carr claims that it ranks among the top 2% of universities in the world but without elaborating on what basis this was assessed.http://www.bsec.canterbury.ac.nz/ Uni in top 2%. Further, the University has promoted itself as being the first university in New Zealand to have been granted five stars by QS Stars, a global university rating system.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5708043/Canterbury-University-gets-top-marks Canterbury University gets top marks. Unlike the QS World University rankings, QS Stars ratings are only given to universities that pay a fee; the programme is designed to give """"...those institutions that are not highly ranked or do not appear in the rankings an opportunity to reach out to their prospect students, to stand out and to be recognised for their excellence.http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/qs-stars/ QS Stars.""""
The second anon wishes to truncate the paragraph after the second sentence, ie from """"In 2011"""" onwards. No reason has been given for this. I have suggested that this third sentence remain, since it is purely factual and referenced, but I am less willing to defend the rest of the paragraph which appears to be combining a number of sources to make an argument or inference not directly supported by the sources directly. My proposal is clearly not satisfactory to either of the anons. I welcome their explanations here, and input from other parties.-gadfium """,0

First, I think it was SatuSuro who made the version about the Faith that is now on the page, and would like to thank him for his research and work. Both of the quotes I have added are verifiable, I can post the references again if necessary; they are not original research; they are also impartial in presenting the Faith's teachings because they do not attempt to sway a person one way or another about what to believe about them but rather present them directly because they ARE the teaching. Anyone elses summary of them could only be inaccurate. There are no major disputes as far as I am aware about the Baha'i teachings about the life of the soul after death. This summary of the Wikipedia article about a neutral point of view I believe is exactly what applies here:

When we discuss an opinion, we attribute the opinion to someone and discuss the fact that they have this opinion. For instance, rather than asserting that """"The Beatles were the greatest band ever"""", locate a source such as Rolling Stone magazine and say: """"Rolling Stone said that the Beatles were the greatest band ever"""", and include a reference to the issue in which that statement was made. Likewise, the statement """"Most people from Liverpool believe that the Beatles were the greatest band ever"""" can be made if it can be supported by references to a particular survey; a claim such as """"The Beatles had many songs that made the UK Singles Chart"""" can also be made, because it is verifiable as fact. The first statement asserts a personal opinion; the second asserts the fact that an opinion exists and attributes it to reliable sources.

Also, the Baha'i Faith has been consistently among the top three fastest growing religions in the world for about the last fifty years. There is sufficient public interest in it for it to be given due consideration on the basis of some other factor, and size and general public knowledge about the Faith are the only two factors remaining that I am aware of. As the Faith is growing faster than public knowledge can keep up with it it should not be considered solely from the point of view of the academic community, so the only impartial test for how much consideration it should be given compared to other religions would be its size, which is estimated at seven to ten million followers worldwide based on the most recent statistics and statements from the Baha'i World Center. Judaism has approximately fourteen million followers world-wide.""",0

 Where do these concepts come from? 

The article was recently revised to say that Old Town is """"in Williamson County, near Franklin"""" (no longer """"in"""" Franklin) and that the mound complex """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""" (no longer simply """"on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""").

I'm puzzled by these changes, which aren't sourced. My investigations (call them """"original research"""") using online maps do indicate that Old Town is in northwestern Williamson County, near Franklin, but not inside the current city limits or even in the urban growth boundary. Thus, I think the geographic location is OK, even though sources have placed it """"in"""" Franklin. 

Let me get this straight.  You want to use insulting language about the edits, but then agree that they are factually correct.  Where is the OR?  I disagree that it is OR to state that the location is in Williamson County.  Whether or not it is currently in the current city limits is a factual matter that I am not actually sure about, but in the historic sweep it is correct to say that the location is near Franklin (think of Franklin having been a small town at one time).  It is """"near"""" Franklin, meaning it is not in modern downtown Franklin.  I see no OR.  

However, I can't agree with """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""". First off, what is later than """"is""""? It appears to me that the mound complex """"is"""" alongside the Harpeth River and """"is"""" on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace. I surmise that the intent was to say that the site was not on a branch of the Natchez Trace when the mound complex was built, but I don't buy that. First off, the previous version of the article never said that the mound complex was built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace; it merely said that it's there now. Secondly, I'm not aware of any source indicating that the mound complex was not built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace. Notwithstanding whatever the current version of the [[Natchez Trace[[ article, it's my understanding (based on diverse sources) that the Trace (which is an interconnected collection of trails, not a single trail) existed for centuries before white people laid eyes on Tennessee, and that archaeologists who have investigated Old Town assume that it was located where it is because of the river, the Trace, and the crossing of Brown's Creek. If the intent was to say that the Trace did not exist when the mound complex was built, I see that as a piece of WP:OR that's inconsistent with many sources.   

Those amendments to the article were in 2 edits, the main one with edit summary """"revise about assertion of location, avoiding unnecessary disclosure and avoiding synthesis (e.g. about 2 creeks being the same, not in a source AFAIK). Drop dup cat."""".  Funny you should be making accusations of original research.  I think the wp:OR accusation should apply more strongly to the previous language, which included wp:OR in the form of synthesis (wp:SYNTH?) about which creek is what (and the synthesis ends up disclosing more about location than is necessary).  I think that """"the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" refers pretty clearly to that branch of the 1800's Natchez Trace, which served as path/roadway for return upstream of persons who had brought rafts or barges down the Mississippi to New Orleans.  The other branch is known as the Ridge Route or something like that and is covered in a different NRHP listing.  These two distinct branches are known in history and described in historical documents, including being described in Williamson County MRA and other documents that Orlady has read.  To refer to the prehistoric mounds having been built along the 1800s-era historic """"Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" is wp:OR, wp:SYNTH, ahistorical, sloppy, generally bad, in poor taste, and whatever else sounds negative, more so than the language which replaced the original language.

OR is bad.  OR was removed by the edits.  OR was not introduced by the edits.  Yay!  Glad we are all agreed.  I am sure there are improvements to the language which can be made, but I would prefer not to argue small wording changes until the bigger article structure questions being discussed above are settled.  Or until Orlady agrees to allowing a third party to judge on wording, and replies about participating in mediation to address the long pattern of conflict. ncram """,0

 A couple of maintainability suggestions for the table 

Currently the table is sortable using {{HS|}} for all columns.  
If we used {{dts|22 October 1949}} for the dates we do not have to put the dates in twice in the column and we can enter the date in any format we like.

Currently there is a {{HS|}} and a {{age in years and days|}} for the length of service for a manager.  Isn't the {{age in years and days|}} on it's own enough?

This is the result of making the changes

It would be nice to have a single page to discuss changes relating to all the Unicode chart templates.

The question is which capitalization is best.

However, I don't see any reason not to capitalize """"reserved"""", """"control"""" and """"not a character"""" to """"Reserved"""", """"Control"""" and """"Not a character"""" on Wikipedia when used as titles.  You could also make a case for capitalizing character names rather than using all upper case (e.g. """"Latin Capital Letter A"""" or """"Latin capital letter A"""" instead of """"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A"""", but in very many cases it would be problematic to decide which words to capitalize and which not, so I would prefer to stick with all upper case character names.

Vandalism warning
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

There’s a well collaborated (London based) group of GREEK Wikipedia sysops/users that  has been spotted to  work systematically in full daily basis propagandazing ultra natioanalistic Greek POV, and distorting related articles. They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.

Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π.

They are also multiple sockpuppets and impersonators of their group members. They are all schizophrenics web vandals unacceptible to wikipedian community.

The US had put them in the list of terrorist-organizations for a brief while before they removed the ETIM.

As to whether it is an occupied nation like Tibet and Inner-Mongolia or not is besides the point. But these articles being passed off as references have NOTHING to do with the ETIM. They do not in anyway convey that the ETIM is being opposed by the countries that are being claimed there. Please take a look at this.

 Good job 

Excellent work on forming those citations. They really improve the article don't they? If you're up to it, you might try the third point in my comment on the article's talk page about adding the Infobox writer template. (I consider the first two points as already covered now). You don't have to do this as it is an elective but if you should decide that it would be an improvement then I would encourage you to give it a try. Try looking at the author's infobox on the right side in this article as an example.

If you decide that you want the infobox but have trouble implementing it then let me know and I'll help you. I'm also going to leave you a welcome below with a collection of links to help you navigate Wikipedia.

"""

First, you are misreading what your first source is. The document you reference is a UN interum report on Resolution 425. 425 dates back to 1978. That document (the report) does not reflect any agreement between the UN and Israel. 425 calls for many things, but there had been no public pledge from Israel on dismantling the SLA. In fact, Israel in public had been saying the opposite. They were not planning to leave until early July. The report being issued on the 22nd isn't very meaningful. Its coincidence. There was a whole series of meetings between the SLA (see later material) and UN/various countries that was a whole lot more damaging than the interium erport on 425.

Second, I think its better to deal with Charbel Barakat's fuller and more accurate version of what happened in May from his congressional testimony in June 2000:

""""During the month of May 2000 our people remitted a memorandum to the office of the United Nations in Nakura in south Lebanon offering suggestions to avoid bloodshed and exodus. During the same month delegations representing our community met with diplomats of the US, UK, and French embassies in Israel and at the United Nations. And on May 18, our representatives met with the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York ... Instead of taking our demands for protection on our land seriously, the United Nations declined to assist us ... The United States, UK and France dismissed our fears and insisted on guarantees which were allegedly granted by the Beirut regime ... The State of Israel only prepared for our potential exodus, ruling out our determination to remain on our land and defend ourselves.""""

""""Despite the abandonment by the international community and against all odds, our people decided to remain and fight for their land and rights while calling endlessly on the UN to deploy its units around our villages. 
On May 22, 2000, and as Israeli units were implementing their own withdrawal and the commander of the SLA was absent in France, the mostly Shiite sector of the security zone collapsed. It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave before the borders closed. Even after the invasion of Hizbollah of this area, the mostly Christian-Druse eastern enclave and the Christian western enclave, decided to defend themselves and protect their citizens after Israel’s withdrawal.
On May 23, 2000, at 8 PM, SLA officers in the western sector received orders from the Israelis to leave their posts as Hizbollah was advancing towards their villages. Thus the SLA was imploded from the inside and was dismantled without any battle. The main reason why the SLA did not remain and fight was the fact that the border was closed behind its back. Without access to medical and logistical supplies, our people was condemned either to surrender to its enemy or flee across the border."""" (from [www.10452lccc.com/special%20studies/barakatjune2000.htm])

The SLA did collapse. What Charbel Barakat is talking about in the MEF comments is that the remainder of the SLA (Christian) in the west did not collapse and was dismanted by Israel. But it was only dismanted after most of the SLA had collapsed. Charbel Barakat and other dead-enders may have wanted (in theory anyway) to fight on in the west, but Israel wasn't going to make any commitment to keep a miniture version of the SLA going in a tiny pocket on the west end of the border. The caution I would give about Barakat and a couple others from the SLA is that sometimes they think of their Christian portion of the SLA as if it were the entire SLA. And from that point of view, the SLA did not collapse and was dismantled by Israel.

The biggest claim made by Barakat is in weasel-words: """"It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave"""". 'It appeared that"""" means he is guessing. Nobody on either side of the border has outright claimed that the Shites were told to leave and that is why they collapsed on the 22nd. Even Barakat is unwilling to make that claim.

Now lots of other things may have happened that the public doesn't know about with regard to the SLA collapse. But the only people who would know the truth are a handful of people at the top of the Israeli government and army. Nobody in the SLA knows much of anything because if Israel was going to collapse them, they would hardly tell them their plan. People (including me) can make lots of hunches and theories about what might have happened, but there are no facts to back any of those theories up.  """,0

It especially aids the reader in articles such as this one, which are replete with numbers, in that numerals are easier to scan.

thanks, Ingrid, for your question, there is nothing wrong if you can see both Azerbaycan manati and manat, that is Azerbaijani language is an agglutinative language, all processes in our language goes by adding suffixes to the words, thus when you say Manat of Azerbaijan, you say Azerbaycan Manati that is that ı is a suffix, which indicates that Manat in this case means that it belongs to the word Azerbaijan. but the name of currency is Manat, as the same you can say Turkmenistan Manati in oreder to indicate that the word manat in this case refers to Turkmensitan
it is a more complex, I'll try to explain it by example:
my manat - mənim manatım
your manat(sing) - sənin manatın
her/his manat - onun manatı
our manat- bizim manatımız
your manat(pl) - sizin manatınız
their manat - onların manatları
that is you can meet many forms of manat with various suffexes, but they do not change its meaning, just relate that word with other words. also you can see manata, manatda, manatdan and etc. hope not bored you",0

TAB
According to former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, in his book By Way of Deception, the Mossad """"was deeply involved with several other warring Lebanese families, paying for information, passing it between groups, even paying the gangs and some Palestinians in the refugee camps for intelligence and services. Besides Gemayel, both the Jumblatt and Berri families were on the Mossad payroll. Source: Ostrovsky, Victor (1990). By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer, p. 316
TAB
Berri is involved in corruption allegations regarding a 1996 coastal motorway in southern Lebanon. The contract for the motorway was won by a firm run by Berri's wife, Randa Assi, and was said to be overpriced by over three hundred million US dollars. Sources: Johnson, Michael (2001). All Honorable Men: The Social Origins Of War In Lebanon , p.236; Schwerna, Tobias (2010). Lebanon: A Model of Consociational Conflict , p.128. 

In 2004, Berri was mentioned in several of the diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks. One cable said that Amal is """"near universally derided as corrupt to the core"""", and that Berri was described by a relative of Musa al-Sadr as having provided social services in the south only through """"wheeling, dealing, and stealing"""". Also according to the cables, Berri receives USD 400,000 a month from Iran, using a fourth of the sum to shore up his support and pocketing the rest. Sources: Gloria Center, Wikileaks cables. 

According to one source, Berri was considered by Rafik Hariri to be """"irredeemably corrupt and unreliable"""", as well as an opportunist, and is thought to maintain his support base through access to state funds. Source:  Blanford, Nicholas (2006). Killing Mr. Lebanon: The Assasination of Rafik Hariri and Its Impact on the Middle East , p. 118

According to leaked diplomatic cables, during the 2006 Lebanon war, Berri, publicly an ally of Hezbollah, described Israel's attacks on Hezbollah to US Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman as being """"like honey"""", and hoped that Israel would complete its mission against Hezbollah quickly. He suggested that the IDF """"markedly improve its targeting intelligence to make air strikes more effective. Either that, or they would have to wipe Hizballah out of the south with a ground offensive."""" He also suggested that """"if Israel succeeds in weakening Hizballah militarily, then he will be more willing to weaken them politically"""". Sources: Wikileaks cables, NOW Media, Aspen Institute, Middle East Online. 

Berri's sister-in-law and close business associate Samira Assi, is said to have made a fortune by getting a contract from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to print one million copies of Gaddafi's """"Green Book"""". Assi's deals are seen as highly controversial, since the founder of the Amal Movement, Musa al-Sadr, is known to have been disappeared on the orders of Gaddafi himself. Sources: Middle East Intelligence Bulletin report, written by the current news director of Congress-funded Al Hurra.

King Air article
Bill, sorry for not responding sooner to your question about the military versions of the 90, and the general length of the article. I've been mulling it over, and I'm still not sure what would be best, but I'm wondering about splitting the article into one about the 90/100 series and another about the 200/300 series. That, to me, is where the logical split is, in a number of ways. The 200/300 (including 350), went by """"Super King Air"""", and while there's a lot of commonality between the 90 and 100, there's much less so between the 100 and 200 (the exception would be the 90F which borrowed the 200's tail, but I wouldn't worry about that). Plus, the PT-6A engine comes in two """"families"""", the large PT6A and the small PT6A (# of PT wheels being a big factor). The 90/100 KAs use small PT6s, the 200/300 use large PT6s, so there's a natural split there. If we split the article there, each would have a fairly decent length, and could possibly be split further down the road if they continued to grow. Just some thoughts....  """,0

We go nowhere like that
Comment. I don't feel ready to back the one or the other position here. For the time being I feel a bit closer to Dhan's position but from a different point of view. I just want to point out two things:
According to a Greek historian, Paparregopoulos, some hellenized Phanariotes families, like Ghikas' family, had lost their Greek identity in the 19th century. This fact seems to justify the use of """"predominantly"""", since in indicates one thing: In the 19th century not 100% of the Phanariotes families had a Greek indentity. Maybe they were 99% but even this 1% justifies the use of """"predominantly"""". I can live without this word (I can also live with the word!), but, if Dhan wants to add it, I cannot prevent him (at least, according to my logic).
If we accept that 99% and not 100% of the Phanariotes were Greeks, this does not affect at all the traits of the Greek War of Independence, as Miskin has said. Ok! Not 100% but maybe 99% of Phanariotes played a role in this war? What does it change? Nothing! A big fuss for nothing! 
I'd like Dahn to further substantiate and back with additional sources his arguments. What about some Googlebooking?! Everybody could do that, in order to reinforce one's arguments.
In any case, I don't think that we can solve this dispute on ourselves. The problem is much deeper. There are two extreme positions and no intention for a compromise. Therefore, I think about inviting an objective third party in this discussion: I speak about  """,0

I doubt it that the Wikipedia introductory sentence warning about damaging a living person refers solely to:
go ahead, say what you want as long as you cannot be caught from the legal view point you can write everything you wish. 

I think Wikipedia refers to some honor and honesty in talking about a living person who can be damaged in his/her reputation and can suffer financial damage as well in his business .
So, it is a question of honor and good editorial behavior in keeping with the truth.

You are pointing out the fact that the Wikipedia article on Ruggero Santilli talks about fringe. The difference between  what that article says and what the Oxyhydrogen  article says is the difference between being fair and being recklessly mean and damaging.
This is my example:

Steve is a photographer and some of his work is considered unprofessional , childish and """"fringe"""" 
(physicist Ruggero Santilli  who is proponent of ideas some of which have been considered fringe theories) as it is in the article about Ruggero Santilli

Steve is an unprofessional photographer and he is an unprofessional """"fringe"""" photographer
( fringe physicist Ruggero Santilli) as in the Oxyhydrogen article

You are saying that Santilli is clueless about electrolysis and therefore all his work is 'fringe"""" ......
how about his books in other subjects published by Plenum, Springer Verlag, Nuovo Cimento?Did you read the? 
You say that you want sources, peer -reviewed article and yet you do not like the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy and cite Calo as having negative comments...how about the positive comments on Santilli's work by Cloonan and Trell in the same Journal? They are University professors .... you also do not like their universities? Do they have a poor reputation in your view? How about Santilli's article in the American Institute of Physics ? AIP also has a poor reputation? 

I added  verbatim to the Oxyhydrogen article only what Wikipedia has in the other article about Santilli. You are confusing people who sell stuff on TV and defraud customers, from the work of reputable scientist who publish and work and are seeking the truth as much as you do and because of this you call  """"fraud, bogus, fringe, nut job. Bunching these two categories (the TV fraud and the researchers)  together is not """"seeking the truth"""" but being reckless and damaging, especially when it was pointed out to you without calling you bogus, nut, fringe ( which could  be justified by par condicio) but I am not doing it for respect toward the readers and especially myself.
Please do not go back to ethics.

Ernie: Well, I'm not surprised at all.  Of course I'll support the templates. They provide a super purpose in linking films.  To be honmest, that's one of the reasons I started editing Argentine films.  I saw the cohesiveness of the section.  The template is very important.

The problem is ego and the """"psychology"""" of some wikipedians.  Some may feel they should have control in the section they work in.  People begin to take """"quasi"""" proprietary thoughts about not only their area of expertise on wiki, but in the edits they make in that area.

There are others who may take the same approach to other areas of the cinema world but place ego very much into it (I've never found you that way).  They subconsciously took it as an affront that you did not talk to them first.

With all due respect, the criticism section as it stands is a total mess. Setting aside the fact that it reads as if the year is 2001, an inordinate amount of text is devoted to a recitation of the Bovard article, which is A) a clear partisan attack piece (it begins with a snide and largely irrelevant attack on then-president Clinton's character), B) a shoddy piece of opinion journalism overwrought with loaded assumptions (witness the dismissive tone about """"politically correct noncompetitive recreation""""), and C) dated. Did nobody else notice this thing is almost a decade old? Yet it is being used as the backbone for the longest subsection on an organization that is evolving, growing, and changing to this very day. Bovard *does* bring facts to the table but as it stands now they are sitting in a void of time and space. His article does not make it clear how statistically representative the examples of """"corruption"""" were to Americorps as it functioned circa 1993-1999, let alone Americorps as it functions today.

I am not an expert by any means on Wikipedia's guidelines, I have never added or edited an article and it would not be appropriate for me to start here. But given this article's immediate onslaught of criticism, I would have expected an ongoing narrative about whether any stuck (especially with the imminent arrival of a conservative presidency) and how (and why) Americorps changed throughout the Bush years, leading into its present growth. Instead what we are left with is the cluttered product of a single user's anti-government tirade. I am not against noting that libertarians have a death wish for Americorps, but take, for instance, the section about Bovard's """"unofficial source,"""" who dismisses the reading program. From the beginning it was a rather questionable inclusion, but it is flatly contradicted by the study cited thereafter. Again, I'm no Wikipedia expert, but it seems to me an empirical measurement of reality should trump the anonymously-sourced attack from a pundit with a clear agenda. Why, then, is this whole exchange even necessary?

Equally embarrassing is the sentence about GED students, who now apparently need to be stigmatized for no reason. The short """"Articles suggest..."""" paragraph is only a little less disastrous; it presupposes that helping people get welfare is a bad thing, a judgment call which I think ought to be left to the reader. And even setting all that aside, why, from a journalistic point of view, does the above paragraph re-introduce the Bovard article? It disrupts the readability of this page, making it all the clearer that the criticism section comes from someone who is more concerned with piling one slanted attack after another than with writing an informative, cogent article. Narrative context is jettisoned in yet another paragraph (""""There have been a number of criticisms..."""") which goes on to raise vague, weaselly arguments sourced by an article that returns a 404. The user above me has a raised a critique that I think is also fair about the last paragraph's apparent opposition to the concept of self-esteem.

If I could make a suggestion (and given my lack of Wiki experience I freely welcome its rejection) this whole section, as well as the one above it, needs to be wiped clean. There is nothing wrong with noting that Americorps had some issues in the '90s, so long as this article leaves one able to discern that we are no longer living in the '90s. As it stands, the specific citations strike me as largely irrelevant cases of excess scrutinizing. The $20k+ cost to the taxpayer per volunteer is a valuable piece of information and should not be omitted from this article. It should also not be mentioned without reference to the benefits that Americorps volunteers provide. Contrary to the what the criticism section implies, it does not seem likely that tens of thousands of volunteers per year are being paid only to paint murals and put on puppet shows. If this means that Wiki editors have to conduct more contemporary research (the last 3-4 years seeming most appropriate) in order to determine just what services Americorps volunteers provide and who they affect, so be it. No doubt it would be even more difficult to assess how Americorps changes the lives and attitudes of its volunteers (and perhaps I am biased supposing from the onset that it creates more generous public services) but this, too, would be a benefit. Cite the cost, describe the benefits as neutrally as possible, and let the reader determine for himself whether the end result is """"efficient."""" And move on. 173.52.83.2  M32""",0

 Relation to gaming modules

I was actively playing AD&D; at the time that Dragonlance was released, I did not play the DL modules but borrowed and read the novels off a friend. My recollection was the books and novels were developed together, though it does seem reasonable that the plots of the novels were based somewhat on the original playtesting of these modules.

 Airbag Fatalities 

I removed this:

""""In Europe the number of people not wearing their seatbelts is very small when compared to the US, and Europeans are less likely to be obese. As a direct result of these two points, European airbags are less powerful than their American counterparts and are therefore less likely to cause loss of life than those fitted to American cars.""""

Give me a break.  If you want to reintroduce this, please provide citations for every claim made in the paragraph.  

Agreed.  I've heard the exact opposite regarding airbag deployment strength, in factthat American-market cars have less forceful airbags because the occupants are more likely not to be wearing their seat belt, whereas in Europe the airbags can deploy faster (more forcefully) because it's assume you're wearing a seatbelt.   KeplerNiko

With exception to the """"Europeans being less obese"""" bit, I'd probably agree with that first statement - sounds about right to me.  

 Dates of Deployment

I take strong issue with the discussion of the dates of airbags first being used in vehicles, especially since it seems to me that it violates Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.  It seems to me that this article is American-car biased, a country whose automobile manufacturers are most assuredly not first when I think of those who were first-adopters of new safety technology.

Particularly, the line about Chrysler making airbags """"standard equipment across its entire line in 1990"""" makes it sound like Chrysler was the first manufacturer to standardize airbag installation.  The next paragraph indicates, however, that US cars produced after 1 April 1989 must have either airbags or automatic seat belts (latter is news to me)it seems to me that the vast majority of manufacturers opted to install airbags over seat belt systems.  However, the way the article is written, it seems like Chrysler's actions were unique and, most of all, done out of its own initiative, rather than being federally mandated.

Quite simply, Chrysler was neither the only company to take this step, nor did it have a choice in the matter. I think the line implying Chrysler did something innovative should be stricken.   KeplerNiko

1970's Implication
The US experiment in the early 1970's ended pretty quickly as I recall. Does the article mean to imply that this was ongoing?   

Maine.gov Link
Regarding link Maine.gov  How do air bags work:
Link has gone bad. Found replacement link at  but
there is little useful information there. As the link adds nothing to the article, I removed the
link entirely.  

...airbags only reduce fatalities in those wearing seatbelts by 8% 
Following up on an old point by Tekfiler, the government does not want you to know this number, since that would be clear indication of a collossal waste in terms of cost benefit analysis. So - the stat is never called out. The [[NHTSA}} page has some interesting data on how U.S. highway deaths have been declining at a slower rate than in other industrialised nations. If airbags were really all they are cracked up to be, seems that would not be true.  

It is also advised that you dont sit too close to the steering wheel because when the airbag inflates it will crush you back in your seat, stopping you from inhaling cause your crest can't go out, therefore stopping you from breathing.

Wikipedia Regrets The Errors

[Suggested Text]:

From June to September of 2007, several false and misleading critical statements appeared at the National Civilian Community Corps (also known as AmeriCorps NCCC) page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Civilian_Community_Corps), in violation of Wikipedia standards.  This is the false text as it appeared:

National Civilian Community Corps

""""...Criticisms
The NCCC program has met with sharp criticisms from some fiscal conservatives who accused it of being a """"boondoggle"""".[4] Most notably, Libertarian pundit and commentator James Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud""""[5], in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years."""" Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it """"a fraud"""".
^ http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188385,00.html ^ http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm""""

Wikipedia relies on its readers and volunteer contributors to avoid or challenge and correct misleading or false information.

The following has been called to our attention:

1.  The statement that read """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud,"""" cited as its source an article at this address by Bovard: http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm  Nowhere in that article does Bovard make that statement.  No mention of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor of the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" appears in that article, nor is AmeriCorps NCCC called a 'waste and fraud.""""  We regret the error.

2. The same sentence went on to state the following:  """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud"""", in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain ...""""

Upon investigation, this statement turns out to be untrue.  Bovard's book (published in hardcover by St. Martin's press) does not contain a chapter of criticisms of AmeriCorps NCCC in the book """"Feeling Your Pain.  In fact, neither """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor the """"National Civilian Community Corps are mentioned at all in the text of that book nor in the book index.  (The chapter in question concerns the umbrella program, AmeriCorps, but does not mention the program known as """"AmeriCorps NCCC'"""" or the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""".

(The only mention to NCCC is in the footnotes, referring to a speech by then-president Clinton, praising, not criticizing, the NCCC.)

In sum, the book """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not dedicate """"an entire chapter of criticisms"""" of AmeriCorps NCCC, contrary to the information posted at the Wikipedia website.  We regret the error.

3.  Also untrue was the sentence """"Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it [i.e., AmeriCorps NCCC] """"a fraud"""".  This sentence was misleading and false.  It was placed at the National Civilian Community Corps page and referred to the antecedent in the previous sentence, the AmeriCorps NCCC.

The claim relied on the article by Bovard at http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm.  No mention of either the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" nor of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" appears in that article.  No evidence has been put forward to support the statement that Mr. Sweet ever labeled AmeriCorps NCCC a """"fraud.""""  We regret the error.

Wikipedia deeply regrets that this misleading text appeared at our National Civilian Community Corps website and that it persisted for as long as it did.

The editor responsible for its appearance and continued re-emergence will no longer have access to the National Civilian Community Corps Wikipedia entry.

Signed: _____

Calls to move forward on the National Civilian Community Corps page, to be a team player, etc., would be better received by this editor if Wikipedia posted a note something like the above at the NCCC site  - not to mention, it might restore some of Wikipedia's credibility on this subject.   Given the nature of the NCCC - a substantial and serious component of U.S. disaster relief and mitigation capacity - and its recent near-demise following misleading claims like those posted at Wikipedia, the statement above is not written as amusement.

 RfC: Should the lead include the owner's description - without giving undue weight to other reliable sources? 

As per the RfC above, 6 people opposed entirely to including the owner's description, and 5 (4 + me) support the idea of including it, but making the sentence neutral so that it does not give undue weight to what other sources say.

Hi Rob, my guess would be editors who sympathize with the British position.  Collins is something of a hero to the British and the Protestant right wingers in Ireland (and are remnants of the former Protestant ruling class) since he signed the treaty to end the Irish War of Independence that created the Irish Free State.  Sinn Fein and the IRA, the left wingers and Catholic, were against it and viewed Collins as a traitor.  The Civil War resulted.  The IRA assassinated him.  The treaty allowed the British to still subjugate the Irish.  Lloyd George and Winston Churchill were ecstatic.  Eamon de Valera and Sinn Fein were not.  They wanted a Republic and to be rid of the British entirely.  The British and the Irish Protestants are still big Collins' fans.

Do not remove this message. If you do, I will replace it and assume that you do not wish the public to see what is really true about you.

Cyde, I cannot believe that I have once respected you as an admin. After looking back at how you offended me (maybe not directly), I feel like a complete asshole. You should not be an administrator. You should be a normal user like me and I should not be writing this to you. You talk so much about policy, yet do you really understand it? I am referring to the blocking policy, which you so blatantly vandalized so many times.

First of all, I wish to ask you about your block of , not because he is my friend, but because I believe the blocking policy was violated. Your block claimed that the """"User has left Wikipedia."""" However, if you blocked him because of this, why was I unable to be blocked on request even though I had asked? And how did you know he had left Wikipedia? Did he specifically tell you to block him?

Second, why is it that you and  always have a part in the leaving of my friends (with the exception of User:GangstaEB)? You know what I mean.

Also, I do not believe that nominating ~25 userboxes for deletion in a single day is within deletion policies. You know when that was. Speaking of userboxes, let's not forget CAUBXD, where you purposely frustrated us by adding your name to the list, and as you know very well, caused it to get deleted.

 The article is incomplete 

Well written and interesting. Good.

I think the article would benefit from identifying the former bands of the members. What I find frustrating is that the article seems to assume knowledge of UK indie music. Why is it a supergroup? Who is Damon Albarn? Paul Simonon? Tony Allen? Simon Tong? I knew Damon, but I had to click 3 more links to find out the others. As an international wiki, anyone outside the UK will have no idea who these people are. The article should explain to anyone assuming no prior knowledge. Mention and link to the Clash, the Verve, Blur etc as well. 

After all, this is meant to be an encyclopaedia. It's not an article in NME, and space isn't an issue. Identifying the history of the members and explaining why it was considered a """"supergroup"""" is surely relevant to the article.

On another note - I only noticed who produced the album was here when I returned to it and looked at the top right side panel. I was expecting to find this at the bottom under the list of personnel. On my first visit I had to click other links to be certain that Danger Mouse had done it.

""""In Europe"""" states Pandora's Box is from 1928, """"Filmography"""" states it's from 1929. Which one is correct?

 The authoritative Louise Brooks Society lists it as 1929.  The movie was still be filmed when Brooks turned 22; there's a picture of cast & crew celebrating it on the London attic set.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.192.5.55   

 Philosophy 
I remember reading in one news article about this individual, it was brief and cryptic, concerning pessimistic aesthetics philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.
There seems an unnerving concentration on the film persona (particularly with the one from """"Box"""", which I do not think is the best image to dwell on, given that it is one of dehumanization and objectification for varyous fetishistic obsessive types). I have a strong intuition that there was infact ALLOT more to this person then what is being focused on by what appears to be a majority of her fans. Is there any further detail in any of the Seven Seals concerning her philosophy, ideology, and maybe even politics (and at best, religion)? Given her scholarly nature, I strongly doubt any real resemblance to the character of that film. Seek the Forms  

 Tone? 
Hi all, glad to read this article, & I think Louise Brooks is way cool, but I have a quibble:  Here & there, it tends to read like a fansite (i.e., a bit gushy) instead of an encyclopedia article.  Does anyone else have this impression?  I think a few word changes might help.  I can take a shot at it.  

 Oh yeh I have. That and the fact that there is a marked lack of any of her philosophies. I see her, first and foremost, a scholar, who wrote film reviews and seven esseys (their subject is not given in this artical), or even any philisophical works (though, they may have been very, very diluted, given that Shopenhauer was a major influence on her, he held a nihilistic perversion of Neo-Platonism that would lead to social anarchy, followed by dictatorship by the Nietzscheans). I have bumped into this recently and was somewhat impressed, though, not satisfied with a lack of insight into her potentially more important contributions (if any). The secret here is, I suspect most of these people are just obsessed perverts (fans, like you said). Thanks

I know W. Lloyd-Thomas and Clifford L.B. Hubbard did some of the older research on the corgi breeds (1930s).  W. Lloyd-Thomas mentioned the Teckel connection (he called it """"Tekal"""") and dated the breed's orgin to around 1200 BC in papers he wrote (some of which I've read).  As is typical in writings of that era, his history is flowery and wordy and doesn't give specifics about the research.  He does say that mid-Cardiganshire is """"particularly wealthy in the remains of early Celtic fortifications (source: """"What the Modern Corgi Owes to its Cardigan Ancestors,"""" AKC Gazette, October 1935),"""" and I can only guess that it's from these remains that the corgi has been dated.  Incidently, it might be better to call the early corgi a """"livestock dog"""" rather than a """"herding dog,"""" as it was more of a guard...not unlike the Rottweiler.  I'm curious what the reason for the doubt is, though...does the corgi just seem recent?  I see no particular reason for skepticism...Celts have been around for a long time.  """,0

Hello, and thank you for your suggestions, User:AdiJapan.

I suppose you're right about """"Bască"""" (though the word """"[Basque]"""" has no connection with Latin, it is more likely a later addition to the Romanian language  I can't imagine a pilleati wearing one p ) and you might be right about """"gîdel"""" also. 

For the other two though, """"adămană"""" and """"dezgauc"""", I heard them used with the indicated meanings (the latter as a verb, as matter of fact). Of course, that doesn't necessary mean that those were the original meanings.

Indeed, we do need a language specialist here (I'm no such creature, unfortunately) but until then, I decided that nowadays meaning is better than no meaning for those words.. and I stand corrected.

FYI
Here is the content of the Monoplane article from Britannica.  It's not an initial.
Monoplane,  type of aircraft with a single pair of wings. The monoplane design has been nearly universally adopted over multiplane configurations because airflow interference between adjacent wings reduces efficiency. The first monoplane was constructed by the Romanian inventor Trajan Vuia, who made a flight of 12 m (40 feet) on March 18, 1906. Louis Blériot of France built a monoplane in 1907 and flew it across the English Channel two years later. Monoplane design proved itself conclusively during World War II, and since then the craft has completely supplanted the biplane except for special purposes. Compare biplane  Best regards.   (☎) """,0

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

Another key one here, Risker notes above, is that we only include information that has been noted by other, reliable, independent sources.

Speedy deletion of Uxi
 A tag has been placed on Uxi, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read our the guidelines on spam as well as the Wikipedia:Business' FAQ for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 p values and the 0.05 standard 

Hi, I'm curious about the origins of the 0.05 p -value standard and didn't want to continue the discussion on the homeopathy talk page, so I hope you don't mind a question here.  I admittedly oversimplified my statement about 0.05 being arbitrary, mainly in an effort to save space and not overexert myself in addressing another editor.  Clearly, """"arbitrary"""" was not the best word, but what I'm curious about is the origins of two standard deviations being established as the cut off for significance.  Is there any inherent reason why two SDs are significant, or is it simply a convenient attribute of any distribution which can be used to define outlying data points?

Well, opposing viewpoints frequently meet in wikis.  """"Neutral"""" POV and """"common sense"""" are highly subjective and the only solutions are to either favour one viewpoint as a matter of site policy or to let people battle it out.  If you choose the former approach, admins need to monitor contributions very carefully.  If the number of contributors is large, you have to police the site through very """"blunt"""" use of editing restrictions (massive IP range blocks, night editing restrictions etc) which slows the development of the wiki considerably.  If you choose the latter, editors are allowed to run free and the project grows quickly.  However, you can end up with long, protracted debates between editors about seemingly trivial points.

Wikipedia was founded on the principle of allowing very open editing with minimal intervention by admins, and I doubt that will ever change.  You can console yourself with the fact that all of the millions of articles here can be copied freely (under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license) to other wiki projects and edited to suit the viewpoint of the site!

I don’t really think he would do that because you can go to prison for five years for misuse of government computer systems especially in a criminal way.  I also think a commissioned officer would have better things to do than to get involoved in any of this, but that’s just me.  But, you see CNFK probably now won’t touch this article with a ten foot pole.

 Hansard not a reliable secondary source 

Over on the David Kelly talk page it says Hansard isn't a reliable Wikipedian source. I am quite frankly puzzled by the reasons given. eg. An editor removed the Hansard quotes as the MP was confused and his (the MPs) opinions don't count, even if he (the MP) is Father of the House - A clear case of opinionating if there ever were one.

It is reasonable to assume that two different editors would agree and make similar edits. Unfortunately, there is a star chamber quality, meaning a huge lack of transparency involved, to how these judgements are issued, and they will not feel an obligation to explain themselves, and no admin can demand a  better rational for how the block was decided.

Had they made even a cursory investigation they would have found ample evidence of her malicious and deranged behaviour.

This is an encyclopedia, not a Roman Catholic mouthpiece. I don't adhere to Christianity or any religion for that matter, but I find this assertion absurd. Assuming for a moment, that there is actually a figure called """"god"""" and there was a personage named """"Mary/Maria,"""" and the """"Bible"""" is the ultimate authority, """"if Mary was not Mother of God, then Jesus was in fact not God"""" is an theologically anachronistic statement. If """"in the beginning, god created the heaven and earth,"""" and Mary came a long time afterwards, then we have a big problem, because if Mary is THEE mother of god, then god couldn't have been around to create Adam, Even and all the people leading up to Mary.

Both of those sites have a local buzz to them.  The crime blog has be exposed many times as an ingenius idea.  It was started to showcase how many repeat violent offenders are given slaps on the wrist.   Very useful to someone wanting info about Charlotte

The realtor site is a company that has been featured on the news for helping fraud victims.   They were recognized by NC State represenative Deborah Ross.    Considering most real estate companies are crooks, its good to highlight one that is not.

Everything that was there, expanded on important details not covered by the article.

That city-data forum is one of the best places to get accurate data from locals.  It's a very strict forum.. there are no advertisements.

Carolina Nightlife is hands down the best Charlotte nightlife resource guide out there.  There is nothing relevant discussing anything about nightlife.  You can't expect to believe that your NARROW VIEW of what you believe is appropriate applies to everyone.  It doesn't!

You are a scumbag!   You ban me prematurely, and then tell me to discuss it.  How am I supposed to do that when I am banned??   I'm glad you clowns love the little power trip you get.   You don't know Charlotte, your selective enforcement policies are BULLSHIT, and you don't follow rules you are entrusted to enforce.",1

"Turkey is in Europe or not? 

I want this topic to be clearly discussed under this topic. I find it silly to put Turkey in the list of Asian countries. Anatolian side of Turkey is geographically in Asia and the Thrace side is in Europe. So, we have to see political and historical relationships of Turkey. I want ask how many of you have seen Turkey playing in Asian football cup? Why is Turkey accepted to be a candidate for European Union if it doesnt belong to Europe? If the deal is cultural history then i advise you to see Turkish constructions in Greece, Bulgaria, Bosnia, Macedonia, Serbia or visit a Museum in Wien to learn if Turks have ever been there. If a religious seperation is the reason, i have nothing to say...

"""Pseudoscience Category ==

I feel strongly that this article should be moved away from the pseudoscience category, as it does fulfill any of WIkipedia's requirements of pseudoscience. Wikipedia states:

Other things usually should not be called pseudoscience on Wikipedia:

Alternative theoretical formulations: Alternative theoretical formulations from within the scientific community, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics as opposed to dark matter, are not pseudoscience, but part of the scientific process. Such theoretical formulations may fail to explain some aspect of reality, but, should they succeed in doing so, will usually be rapidly accepted. For instance, the theory of continental drift had quite a lot of evidence, but was heavily criticised because there was no known mechanism for continents to move, and thus such evidence was dismissed. When such a mechanism was discovered, it became mainstream as plate tectonics.

To determine whether something falls into the category of pseudoscience or merely an alternative theoretical formulation, consider this: Alternative theoretical formulations generally tweak things on the frontiers of science, or deal with strong, puzzling evidence which it is difficult to explain away, in an effort to create a model that better explains reality. Pseudoscience generally proposes changes in basic scientific laws or reality in order to allow some phenomenon which the supporters want to believe occurs, but lack the strong scientific evidence that would justify such major changes. Pseudoscience usually relies mainly on weak evidence, such as anecdotal evidence or weak statistical evidence at just above the level of detection, though it may have a few papers with positive results, for example: parapsychology and homeopathy.

""""AIDS denialists"""" are not proposing a new form of science based on non-scientific methods, they are merely disputing that the claims that other scientists make, and these disputes arise ENTIRELY from science. In fact, """"AIDS denialists"""" claim that MAINSTREAM scientists are not using science correctly. In fact, all they are doing is asking for scientific proof of what the mainstream scientific community insists exists but can't verify.

An added remark in my article that will please Makemi a lot
To prove  that I do not have any interest in praising this new CEUS computer piano, I add the following remark in my article:
""""Bösendorfer has a reputation of excellence at piano making. Moreover, German-speaking countries such as Austria have a tradition of excellence at anything related to solving complex engineering tasks. And lastly, Austria is in Europe and the way products are advertised in Europe is much more honest than the way they are advertised in the USA (features of products mentioned by European companies are nearly always true contrary to what happens in the USA!). Consequently, there is no reason to doubt that the features that Bösendorfer mentions on their web site concerning this new CEUS Computer Grand Piano will prove to be true when they will be assessed by independent parties.""""

So, here is the new, latest version of my article; it should pleased even the worst complainers and prove that I am with no agenda at all!!
The New (2006) Bösendorfer Reproducing Grand Piano: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano
During the past recent decades, a reproducing piano (also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano) has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces. The touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano. However, a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it. Usually, it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard, at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others, and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard (many digital sounds are available: piano, harpsichord, organ, strings, etc.). It also has a MIDI interface that allows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular MIDI format. The capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard. However, the MIDI format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of 127 scales (or 127 steps if you prefer). The problem is that most of the pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed, making these 127 scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers. Consequently, a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the MIDI format. In summary, a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old (an acoustic piano) with the new (a MIDI format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano) at the same time. It allows the pianist to play the numerous MIDI piano pieces available but, more importantly, to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the MIDI format.

The quality of the Bösendorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making.

Bösendorfer also kept in touch with modernity. They took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their SE 290 computer piano that was made in collaboration with Wayne Stahnke. It was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time.
At the beginning of 2006, Bösendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano.

Previously to the Bösendorfer CEUS Computer Grand Piano, several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be. These studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos (including the SE 290 computer piano) were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should have been (see in particular """"Measurement and reproduction accuracy of computer-controlled grand pianos"""" by Werner Goebl, et al., August 6-9, 2003).

Taking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the accuracy of its reproducing piano (the SE 290 computer piano), Bösendorfer set themselves to create an even more accurate reproducing piano that would accomplish THE VERY CHALLENGING GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO RECORD AND P",0

"ARTPOP Consensus 

  There has been a long discussion on the ARTPOP talk page about what the critical reception page and I'm attempting to bring in outside opinions as the discussion has gotten stagnant. Just to make sure you understand the situation fully, here are the nine sources I've listed that explicitly state that the album received generally positive reviews: DigitalSpy,  Metacritic's weighted consensus of generally favorable, The Huffington Post, Entertainmentwise, YahooMusic, The Southern Digest, Pride Publishing Group, Off the Shelf, Street Insider. I'm arguing for the page to state that Artpop received general positive reviews with a disclaimer afterwards that states that the reception has been more ambivalent than her past works. STATic has been engaged in this debate for months and has admitted twice that he dislikes Lady Gaga and even made fun of her and her fans, which obviously constitutes WP:Bias. Homeostasis has previously been blocked from editing due to his unprofessional behavior on Gaga pages and has recently admitted that he's been accused numerous times of bias against the artist in question. This has been a ridiculous process that had no business lasting as long as it did, but as you can see, the consensus is obviously generally positive, although the response was more ambivalent than her previous work.",0

I would assume more good faith upon the part of admins like CHL.  His editing history does not suggest any kind of preoccupation with this topic, unlike that of some other editors here, and he was completely open about the POV of the sources he put forth and the reason he cited them.  The sourcing you cite (Yassky, Crooker, and Silveira v. Lockyer) on the OED issue all has a definite anti-gun slant, and unlike CHL you did not disclose that fact.  So do you question your own ability to separate your personal opinion from your editorial duties?

Both of you make good points about the OED: it's not OR, but it probably should be cited to a reliable source for the analysis, like the Yassky article.  I think the WP:NAME point is a good one, too  maybe this article should be moved back to its old name.

I notice that one of the first articles you created appears to be an article about yourself.

Your user page, however, is a great place to write about yourself. Just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in, and edit it normally.

The page you created about yourself has been or will shortly be speedily deleted from Wikipedia, but if you want to use the content from it, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

 Comment intended for Schlafly page 
I received a 7-day block for my previous comments, and now an indefinite block. Here
is a comment that I intended for the Schlafly talk page.

I believe that the Phyllis Schlafly article falsely maligns Schlafly by misinterpreting a NY Times book review.

 The article implies that Schlafly opposed Nixon over """"segregation and discrimination"""",
while the source only says that she was with conservatives who were going to oppose whatever Rockefeller proposed.
 The article relies on a Jewish NY Times columnist raising a Jewish issue,
without mentioning that the columnist is a Jew who writes about Jewish issues, and that no one else raises this Jewish issue.
 The article implies that Schlafly used Jewish code words, while the source
does not explicitly say so. All the source really says is that her opinion is that
the biography should have commented on the matter further.

The WP BLP policy requires that these false allegations be removed.   """,0

Archont Petar and Petar Gojniković are two different people. Archont Petar was born in ca. 930. Petar Gojniković was born much earlier.

 Reliability of U2gigs.com

Can you get any more absurd? Was """"biologists"""" in references to CREATIONIST BIOLOGISTS? OF COURSE NOT, and yet in keeping with a weasel, you would have it so that people think """"biologists"""" are only those who support MACRO-EVOLUTION. Second, what does it matter even if it were an """"invented term"""", is that a sin? Is that forbidden in Wikipedia? Third, IT'S A PHRASE pointing out to what type of biologists are being referred to, and there is no law in Wikipedia and it is no sin, to clarify. Fourth, I already stated why I was removing, as I said in the notes, certain references which were not relevant. Fifth: what does the fact that the mainstream (and it was also left out the """"scientific community"""" mentioned was the MAINSTREAM one (again with the weasel-wording and bigotry) have to do with CRITICISMS of macro-evolution? NOTHING, it's distracting propaganda used to distract any reader from focusing on the criticisms and to instead focus on THE ALLEGED CONSENSUS, and as administrators in Wikipedia love to point out only when it is convenient: """"the truth is not determined by consensus"""". Can you answer my points?

""":::::::::""""Systematically killed"""" is POV. The armies in Tunisia and Egypt weren't attacked, yet they still shot protesters, Egypt shot more within the first month than were killed in Syria the first month, only after the opposition took up arms did the body count rise dramatically. Of course the clashes weren't sectarian in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, since they're overwhelmingly Sunni. That didn't keep Christian Egyptians from being attacked by Salafists though. If the Shia of Bahrain took up arms as the Sunnis in Syria do, they'll be """"massacred"""" too, no doubt about it. And the West wouldn't do a damn thing. Libya was more of a tribe-thing, though secularism versus Islamism also played a role. Secular Liberals in all countries were just the spice that ignited the unrest, they've had zero influence since, unlike what Western media tries to portray.

"MATIA, I have told you a hundred times that articles on dialects do NOT have the word language in the title. Witness Brigish English, Mandarin (linguistics), Flemish (linguistics), Ashkenazi Hebrew, Cantonese (linguistics), American English, Sephardi Hebrew, etc etc... Arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by Wikipedia policy, therefore Arvanitic language or Arvanitika language are out of the question. I don't want to use Arvanitika Albanian as it will be too controversial (so i don't want Albanian in the title). Therefore, the only options are Arvanitic or Arvanitika. They can and should be used. Arvanitic has the majority vote, and therefore that shall be used. What is wrong with it? It is neutral. It does not prescribe that Arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out, the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. Wikipedia should not take sides and especially Wikipedia should not say that UNESCO, Britannica etc aree wrong. Macedonian and Luxembourgish etc CAN be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are (while the same sources say that Arvanitic is a dialect). If Britannica or UNESCO etc said that they were dialects, then they could be treated as such. No neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. Why should they be treated as such. Every neutral source says that Arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. We can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text, but NOT in the title. Arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. Possibilities of Arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article, NOT in the title as that would be a violation of Wikipedia's policies. What UNESCO, Britannica etc say is assumed correct according to WP:V and WP:NOR. I am not labeling Arvanites Albanians against their will. Are we labeling the Irish English against their will by calling their language (Hiberno English) a dialect of English? No! So stop that straw man argument. Arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone AND has majority support here and will be used according to policy. The world is not made to please you, neither is Wikipedia. We have policies that must be observed, so if you want to use Wikipedia, you will just have to accept them. Regards   (PS does peace mean having to violate WP policies?

"Ah, look, another sock-buddy of TheOldJacobtrite crawls out the woodwork to support his opinionated and personal-editing prejudice. And still they hypocritically defy admin.
Mark Arsten was the Admin who made the decision when TheOldJacobite tried to refer me for vandalism... Electric Wombat made his own views known.
Yes, the BBC appear to have archived off their radio interview and feature broadcast since the original edit. It looks like they do this after 14 days. However, the newspaper articles are still online, as is the download pages that prove that this was a properly released single with a full marketing and promotional plan behind it...(I suppose that you'll next be saying that Amazon and Apple are not credible reference points to confirm the song!!!). The charity's official website also contains a suitable reference that conforms to Wiki policy.  Their website is registered with the UK Government's Charity Commission as their official registered website, or are you intending to argue that the Charities Commission of the United Kingdom also fails to meet credibility policy?  (it would not surprise me if you did, even though that organization also has it's own Wiki entry and is referenced thousands of times in other articles - editors like you and TheOldjacobite like to pick and choose which reference points based on personal opinion, and not the fact of the matter.  That is shown in your logs. Having looked at WP:SONGCOVER for the twentieth time, this entry clearly meets all the criteria, so please stop quoting policy enforcement when the policy is met, otherwise you risk making yourself look more and more stupid every time you delete it or incorrectly quote a policy to which the entry conforms.
TheOldJacobite and his other sock-puppets, or buddy puppets, have referred the entry to admin, for both an (unfounded) allegation of vandalism, and whether the entry met policy criteria. He also asked for the page to be locked, and me blocked, on the basis of the entry - see the referrals for vandalism and page locking request pages...etc.  The entry was reviewed and found to be suitable and referenced correctly, even if the BBC programme has since been archived - that is, however, the whole point of the archival retrieval date noted within the reference tag.
The Admin do not feel that the page warrants locking, nor me to be blocked, as I am simply conforming to Wikipedia policies; policies that are so liberally quoted at me by those who then hypocritically contradict the very policy they like to crow about.
Is it any wonder that thousands of people are wholly unsatisfied with the general atmosphere within Wikipedia when a few (almost trolling) editors like to arbitrarily remove information simply based on personal views rather than verifiable links. TheOldJacobite, Sjo and now you, have simply shown that if you are proven wrong, had the policies correctly pointed out to you (later backed up by admin) you STILL will not accept the edit, preferring instead to continue playing childish games in repetitive removal of something to which you have some sort of weird personal issue with.
Your own deletion of this edit, following admin's clear acceptance of the entry is - like TheOldJacobite's and Sjo's behavior - now clearly in breach of Wiki policy and now suitable for requesting a temporary edit block to be placed on your account for, basically, ignoring admin's earlier decision on this matter.",0

I do not feel, nor ever said any conspiracies were involved, I merely question the length of life and time after the shooting. I feel bad for Mr. Gunby and his families loss. As to Lavergne, read here what he says about where Whitman would be at the time Lavergne wrote this (last sentence) []. Now look up glioblastoma muti-forme grade IV brain tumor, and look at the prognosis - how could Whitman be alive as of 2006 (my best guess for when Lavergne wrote the """"Why"""" article), and/or survived a lengthy trial? No, I do not have his book, but I read enough of it in Austin when it first came out, to know there was something was wrong, because he and I had access to the all of the FBI, APD and Whitman's diaries. I have all of the files and lot of the photos (I don't know if Lavergne does), plus audio interviews with Whitman's victims, professors and friends. A few of the photos in the Whitman article are mine. I represented Houston McCoy and Jeannie Speed, the widow of slain officer Billy Speed. But I realize that makes me have a WP:COI (except for the photos that others say should stay). So I have given you enough to consider, and I will return to my self-imposed ban. You forced me out, with your allegations and characterizations. You have Lavergne's book, I'm sure he will autograph it for you. Best of luck to you.2001:558:6007:27:7992:7DA3:D702:EE6A  """,0

I know there are fewer usable sources now but that doesn't mean the median should be leveled off with irrelevant sources. The other sources are relatively outdated so adding them in would not be representative of the November browser usage share. Also 2 out 3 of the sources were Europe only and 1 of those was excluded already for that reason. If more sources are to be considered they need to be global and reliably update at least monthly otherwise the medians would be heavily skewed in scope and/or time which would be a worse situation than not having them at all which is as it currently stands.,0
"Requested move 23 May 2014

:Ramona Lisa →  – The current name, Ramona Lisa, is Carolina Polachek's musical alias and not her true birth name. The overall page about Caroline Polachek's musical career should be aptly titled with her real name, Caroline Polachek. A Caroline Polachek Wikipedia page does exist; however, it automatically reroutes to be the Ramona Lisa page when it should be the other way around. Ramona Lisa information should definitely be within Caroline Polachek's page but as a section or subsection rather than the title of the entire page.

My apologies if my actions have been disruptive and thank you for informing me.

The categories the articles are in are all in the spirituality category themselves. Most of the articles were the lead articles to categories that themselves appear directly under the spirituality domain (eg spiritualism article is in spiritualism category which is an immediate subcategory of spirituality.

"Hank Zipzer- Barfing in the Back Seat
Hank Zipzer is a fifth grader who consistently gets in trouble and has learning difficulties. In this book, Hank’s dad, Stanley Zipzer, raced into the room where the Zipzer family was sitting. Excited he exclaimed, “Road trip!” He was so happy that he knocked over the Raisin Bran Hank was eating. Fortunately, Cheerio, their dog, consumed the spilled cereal; the Zipzer family never needed to clean up anything since they got Cheerio. Hank asked if they had to come as well with Stan and Randi Zipzer, Hank’s parents. Emily, who always liked to answer people’s questions explained that they would never let them stay home with the TV remote and microwave dinners. The only reason dad wanted to go on a road trip was because there was a crossword puzzle tournament; Hank’s dad loved crossword puzzles and when he saw one, he never took his eyes of it. The only things Hank could say were wow, oh wow and wowee wow wow wow. Mum promises that they would go to a theme park, called Colossus Coaster Kingdom. They were also allowed to bring one special guest of their choice along with them. Emily chooses Katherine, her iguana, and Hank chooses Frankie Townsend. 
Ms Adolf gives Hank a homework packet which has nine-hundred pages and Hank cannot go on any of the rides until he finishes all of his homework. They are all allowed to choose a place to stop at. Dad picked a library. Emily and Katherine choose the science museum. Frankie Townsend picks a basketball court. Mum chooses a honey farm and Hank chooses the theme park. Dad looked at the library, Emily studied the museum, mum looked the farm and they went to a hotel where Hank loses his homework; Frankie had to give up twenty pounds and his trip to the court just to save Hank. Hank doesn’t finish his homework on time and cannot go on any of the rides; he had to watch his dad complete all his crossword puzzles. Mr Zipzer becomes one of the top five people who participated. Everyone didn’t complete the puzzle in the time that was given. First place was Martina Stone from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Second place was HANK’S DAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Since Hank didn’t complete the homework packet, he had no idea what words will come out of Ms Adolf’s mouth this time. Anyway, Hank didn’t care about not completing his homework because always getting detention was usual for him.",0

"I'd just like to chime in that I experienced these things on several occasions in Tokyo, and I'd like to voice my vehement opposition to them. They're not annoying, they're debilitating. Everything mentioned in The Mosquito#Health effects should be taken seriously; it's not simply a “noise”, it’s a pulsing. Something like this: |>-|>-|>-|>-|>-|>-|>-|>-|>-. Bang loud, quickly fades out, and then repeats, probably 2-3 times per second. When I came across them, it went straight to my inner ear and made me disoriented within seconds and physically nauseous within a minute of exposure. The fact that it emits at up to 94 decibels, to me, should make it highly controversial. At 85 dB, OSHA requires hearing protection in a factory. 94 decibels is louder than a lawnmower, and these speakers are usually stuck run above your head on sidewalks. To some of the previous comments in this article, to me, The Mosquito less of an anti-loitering machine and more of a military sound-weapon.

All three titles

 Voyage to Faremido 
 Voyaĝo al Faremido 
are the literal transformation of each other.

Capillaria is a distinct novel, with a different topic. Science, nature etc are not discussed (or mentioned only slightly), the novels main topic is the coexistence of men and women. The title has no meaning in Hungarian (and I suppose, neither in English or in Esperanto). In Hungarian, the most similar word it may associate with is “capillar”, but I do not know why: I have not found yet anything related to capillars in the novel.

In some editions, these two novels were published in one book (sometimes under supertitle “Gulliver's new travels”). But their topic is not related. Only a formal relatedness exists: Voyage to Faremido is presented as the fifth, Capillaria as the sixth travel of Gulliver.

"""==Bulls/Blackhawks/Rangers==

There's only one reason why I've been inserting this into the Chicago Bulls article. I do mention that the Blackhawks and Bulls were in their respective league's finals in 1992. The only reason I mention the New York Rangers and the Knicks in 1994 is because Mike Keenan was coach of the Blackhawks in 1992 and was coach of the Rangers in 1994. During 1994, he was able to draw many parallels between the two dramas, having had experiences in seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective league's finals in the same year.  , (talk), 

There's only one reason why I mention Mike Keenan about the Bulls in 1992: In 1994, when he coached the Rangers to the Stanley Cup, the Knicks were in their finals. Then, he was able to draw from his many experiences seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective league's finals in the same year. Phil Jackson was right about the Rangers Stanley Cup being a great part of a great chapter in New York sports history. He knew that Keenan was experiencing what he experienced in Chicago two years before.  , (talk), 

The main source I'm citing is """"Spring of '94,"""" which aired in MSG Network, as well as my own thoughts for all of this. I followed both dramas in which both NBA and NHL teams from one city were in their respective league's finals in the same year. (Chicago in 1992, New York in 1994) During the drama in New York when the Knicks and the Rangers made it to their respective league's finals, Keenan drew from all his experiences seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective league's finals in the same year that it was going to be a great chapter in a city's sports history. He knew from his experiences in Chicago that the Rangers' first Stanley Cup win in 54 years would be that. You have to keep in mind that he was coach of the Blackhawks in 1992 and the Rangers in 1994.  , (talk), 

The only reason why I mention the Blackhawks in the article on Phil Jackson and the 1992 Blackhawks in every article associated with the 1992 Bulls is because the coach of the Blackhawks in 1992, Mike Keenan, was able to draw from all his experiences from the Bulls/Blackhawks drama during the 1994 drama in New York when the Knicks and the Rangers were in their respective league's finals that year. Phil Jackson said the same thing.  , (talk),

There's only one reason why I mention the New York Rangers 3-2 win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals in Houston Rockets articles. I want to make clear that their win in Game 7 of the NBA Finals denied New York from having both NBA and NHL titles in the same year, as the Rockets defeated the Knicks.

At the start of the conflict, Hamas declared that the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit had been wounded by Israeli fire, later announcing that his condition was no longer of interest to them. Throughout the conflict, Hamas repeatedly released messages that they had killed or captured Israeli soldiers, even though no Israeli soldiers were actually captured during the fighting.

 Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse 
Report to a Chair:

Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records  

The issue stems from, as you'll see in the article's history section, my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for Dan Howitt, with the press article references.

Hu12's post:
After going through the """"google results"""" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. Appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. It has been removed. I'd suggest that Dan Howitt  read the following, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world and Law Of Unintended ConsequencesHu12

My reply:
Please remove Hu12's Libel and Vandalism above and please report this user's abuse to Wikipedia administration. Also, Hu12 of the """"google results"""" you searched most are in support of Dan Howitt, with tons of his official summit photos on Rainier, Adams, Hood, Shasta, and listings of his timing officials. You strangely give weight to the abusive chat-site gossip and unsupported libel, and your own post above is of that nature. Chat-sites with this sort of conduct are sad. I'm reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki administration.Saffron1x (talk) 

Note Hu12 cites a link above as support for his allegations of Dan Howitt.  In reading the chat-site thread, and note it's a mere chat-site and has a lot of personal attacks, gossip, unfounded content, libel, etc, you will, nevertheless, find considerable support for Howitt including climbing record photos, timing officials names, etc.  Hu12 emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases, and this is gossip and unsupported.""",0

I think the doubt comes over the next part of the sentence, """"...to know more about these scientists' views..."""". I agree with that, but we have an RFC going on above partly to determine exactly what is the purpose of this list.

"On balance, the analysis of the path of Katrina shows that, in the final few hours, the hurricane veered away from downtown New Orleans, heading actually slightly northeast toward Mississippi where most people had evacuated or had trees to climb.  The storm tide in Mississippi was typically 20-32 feet (10-m) high after 4 hours, gutting 3rd-floor rooms, while in New Orleans, the tide was less than 7 feet (2 m) from being on the weak (west) side of the eye-path.  The levee system, raised to 23-feet high, would have been swamped 8 feet under by the Mississippi tide that flooded 12 miles inland.

Also, just before landfall, Katrina's eyewall replacement cycle miraculously reduced wind-speed from a Hurricane-Camille force down to only 125 mph (200 km/h), which might have shattered most windows in the French Quarter, but the wind subsided.  The 50,000 left in New Orleans could have faced a gushing sea of broken glass, but instead, saw slowly rising water for days, and had time to leave or wait for evacuation help from FEMA.

Although Katrina's reduced winds might seem like a made-for-NOLA miracle, many hurricanes have undergone a similar eyewall replacement cycle as winds slow suddenly when a hurricane approaches a wide land mass.",0

This includes the material concerns, robotics, energy transfer to power the climbers, etc.  Even more notable is that all the talk on this topic mostly concerns ascension, ie placing satellites into orbit.  Very little is concerned about or researched on the topic of descension with a space elevator.  Mind I call it a space elevator because this is the recognized term used to describe it within technical circuits, including NASA and other research institutions.  I agree that the idea is a possibility within 200 years for a powered descent without heat shielding,  but as of now, there is simply no research, talk or even speculation on any project to even look into it.  Thus, a mention at best within the article.

 Russians in Georgia 

First, here's some statistics (all the Soviet censuses) for Georgia proper, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It's in Russian but you shouldn't have any difficulties with these tables (Russians are """"русские"""" in Russian, just find appropriate columns).

Georgia

Ethnic Russians appeared in Georgia in significant numbers after Georgia became part of the Russian Empire in 1803 (Kartli and Kakheti) - 1878 (Ajara). There were 79082 and 19273 people who indicated Russian as their mother language in Tiflis Governorate  and Kutais Governorate  respectively. Dukhobors have to be mentioned as well.

As you can see from the census data the Russian population had risen from 83 to the maximum of 319 thousand between 1926 and 1959 and then began to decline slowly to 266 thousand in 1989. Migration and lower birth rates were the main reasons of this decline.

Obviously, many Russians left Georgia during the 1990s due to economic hardships (mainly, imho) and other reasons.

All other criteria are more or less satisfied - PLO-EC is SoP provisional government in exile, SoP has established diplomatic relations with many other states, SoP has diplomatic recognition by many other states, SoP accepts the membership obligations and has submitted membership application. The rest of the criteria depend on the judgment of UNSC and UNGA - whether SoP is """"peace loving"""", whether SoP is """"able and willing"""" to carry out the membership obligations. Even if it's deemed """"peace loving and willing to carry out the obligations"""" the """"problem"""" criteria is whether it's """"really a state"""" (because it doesn't have control over populated territory) and the related whether it's """"able to carry out the obligations"""" (because a state needs control over populated territory, otherwise it functions only in the diplomatic realm as a government-in-exile and doesn't have the ability to do anything on the ground). Of course, if the majority of all UNSC permanent members and 2/3rds of the UN members want - for political reasons - they can grant membership to a GiE (turn a blind eye to the lack of territorial control or resort to some reasoning that it's able to comply and only the foreign occupation prevents it, but that occupation is declared illegal by this and that UNSC and ICJ acts, so they won't take it into account, etc.)
Do you insist on adding such OR/SYN unsourced analysis? Unfortunately we don't have the UNSC 2011 report that maybe deals with those issues.   """,0

Spamming: Posting an excessive number of messages to individual users, or to users with no significant connection to the topic at hand.
Campaigning: Posting a notification of discussion that presents the topic in a non-neutral manner.
Vote-stacking: Posting messages to users selected based on their known opinions (which may be made known by a userbox, user category, or prior statement). Vote-banking involves recruiting editors perceived as having a common viewpoint for a group, similar to a political party, in the expectation that notifying the group of any discussion related to that viewpoint will result in a numerical advantage, much as a form of prearranged vote stacking.
Stealth canvassing: Contacting users off-wiki (by e-mail, for example) to persuade them to join in discussions (unless there is a specific reason not to use talk pages)
Soliciting support other than by posting direct messages, such as using a custom signature with a message promoting a specific position on any issue being discussed.

"JON R. CAVAIANI
SERGEANT MAJOR (RETIRED)
Jon R. Cavaiani was born in Murphys, Ireland and sent to England in 1943.
He came to the United States in 1947 and in 1953 moved to the small farming community of Ballico, California to be with his stepfather, Ugo Cavaiani. In 1961 Ugo formally adopted Jon and in 1968 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

Jon Cavaiani joined the U.S. Army in 1969. He volunteered for Special Forces where he spent the next 17 years. Cavaiani was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions while a platoon leader on an isolated radio relay site deep in enemy territory. Jon was serving with the studies and observations group (SOG), an elite reconnaissance unit when he was written up for the Medal of Honor for his actions on 4 and 5 June, 1971, in Vietnam. Eleven days after this action, wounded and still trying to evade the enemy, Jon was captured and spent the next 23 months as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.

His other assignments included tours in the Middle East, South America, Europe and Southeast Asia. Jon spent three years in Berlin, Germany as the Senior Operations Sergeant Major for British, French and U.S. Forces. He was selected and assigned to the United States’ most elite Counter-Terrorist Force.

Upon retiring, Jon has made time available to serve as the 6th region director of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Cavaiani recently graduated with honors from the culinary arts program in Columbia, Ca., where he and his wife Barbara live. Jon has three grandsons and two granddaughters.

Among his numerous awards and decorations are the nation’s highest award for valor, the Army Medal of Honor; the Legion of Valor, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal (Valor), Purple Heart with oak leaf clusters. Jon was a freefell and static line jumpmaster and has over 5,000 jumps all over the world.",0

"Depends what you consider nu metal bands.  Please make a list.   

 I thought there already was one?

On the List of Nu metal musical groups, only Korn and Kittie overlap (and I didn't even add Kittie to the Alternative metal list; someone else did).  All others that overlap are filed under Instigators/Progenators (which means they aren't nu metal artists).   

 Pretty much all of them on the list are correct. However, the 'insigators' were simply some of the first Nu Metal bands. Ive listed them below:

 Deftones
 Fear Factory
 Godsmack
 Korn
 Rage Against the Machine
 System of a Down

 They are all Nu Metal bands. If there is a Alternative Metal genre, it needs defining as exactly what it is. Gothic metal's and symphonic metal's 'Sound, Constructs and Lyrics' sections make for good templates for writing down what a genre consists of. 

 I dont want to delete this article if it can be kept, as a lot of editers have put good work into this. But if its essentially Nu Metal, it needs to be merged. If needs be, it can be mentioned on the Nu Metal article in the same way Gothic-Doom is mentioned in the gothic metal article.",0

[quote]Sociologist and anthropologist Robert Stuckert examined census and fertility data to estimate how many blacks in America had passed as white, and how many whites had African ancestry as a result. His statistical tables showed that during the 1940s, 15,550 light-skinned blacks per year crossed over to live as whites, for a total of about 155,500 for the decade. Based on these figures, he determined that by 1950, some 21% of whites (about 28 million people then) had black ancestry within the last four generations, and he predicted that this number would only grow in the decades to come.[/quote]

Although the focus of that article is on the various explanations that have been proposed for this IQ difference, the IQ difference itself is considered central enough to the article that it’s represented visually in this chart.  This image used to be part of the article also—it was eventually removed because editors decided that it was original research, but nobody there had a problem with the idea of this data being depicted with an image.

The original research claim obviously doesn’t apply to an image from the DOJ website, and I think all of the same principles that apply to race and intelligence apply here also.

"""
Can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty.  I'm certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as """"problematic"""".  Five weeks ago I was getting involved in wikipedia and I was feeling enthusiastic, so I posted something to some user groups (reaching 10,000+ members), encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia.  I thought, at the time, that long-time wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people, and that wikipedians would be happy that I encouraged others to participate.  I was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute.  The groups I posted to were user groups, not employee groups.  But yes, I guess that some employees belong to these groups as well.  And my comment about Hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal POV is that he found a good way for someone with COI to contribute. 

I feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. It is un-welcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors.  I see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world, trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding.  I think that even if I only have time to make a small number of contributions, I feel I am helping, and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia.  So seeing your criticism that I am not making enough edits to non-commercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.
I hate feeling that I have to defend my reputation here, and I don't agree with you that editing non-commercial pages should improve anyone's appearance of trustworthiness.  However, your claim that I am only editing the wikipedia entries of """"these commercial products"""" is also just incorrect.  I don't know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others, but if there is, you would see that I've been making edits to many non-commercial pages, including CRISP-DM, Data mining, the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Predictive analytics, Statistics, Customer retention, Predictive Model Markup Language, Anomaly detection, SEMMA, Machine learning, Jacques Cousteau, SIGKDD, Decision tree learning.  Sometimes I'm making simple formatting edits, and sometimes I'm spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the CRISP-DM page.  Yes, my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining, because that is where I have the greatest interest and knowledge.  Similarly, when I guest lecture at local universities, I lecture to these types of classes, not due to any collusion, but because that's what I know.

Thanks for listening to my mini-rant.  I know I'm taking this more personally than you probably meant it.  But it bothers me when someone questions that I am not working hard enough or they question my ethics, and that's what your comments feel like.  All I'm asking is that long-established wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging, and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions (however small).  New people grow and adjust - but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community.  Please be patient and encouraging to new people.

One thing that is needful to attain NPOV is to avoid stereotypes. You've just created one (above) though I doubt that you did it intentionally, as some other editors regularly do. This is the portrayal of the opposition as judgemental, hellfire and brimstone types. This would be characteristic only of the most extreme fundamentalists (like Fred Phelps). It is not characteristic of the majority of conservative Christians; even a lot of fundamentalists would not agree, and are in opposition to those like Fred Phelps.
There are actually these extreme judgemental fundamentalists on both sides of the issue; only the guys in the white hats trade with the ones in the black hats. Witness the pro-homosexuals who use judgemental epithets (even on these talk pages) like bigot and homophobe. To get the page into NPOV we have to get past the stereotypes and the epithets.
A more typical conservative Christian view, and a more fair characterization, would be to think in terms of an owner's manual. If you drive your car disregarding the manufacturer's intructions; i.e. you abuse the car in various ways and don't perform the maintainence on the schedule that manufacturer gives, your car will suffer from it. It's not politically correct to mention, but it's simple and plain truth that homosexuals have shorter life expectancy; in fact promiscuity of whatever flavor will shorten a person's lifespan. You can develop the rest of this line of thought as well as I can. -And that is just physical health.

"I think you're getting ahead of yourself.  That list is flawed regardless of additional citation.  The editor who added them is not addressing her or himself to the article at hand.

A better statement of policy is to enforce the actual definition of the term male chauvinism and not to let it be used interchangably with the term sexism.  The works as described do not address the theme of male chauvinism but that of sexism.  In none of the descriptions is any character credited with holding an unreasoned belief in male superiority.  Instead the male characters are treating women badly for reasons unknown or for reasons far more complicated (psycho-sexually in at least three of these instances, involving extremely complex paraphelias such as sadism and latent pedophilia) than a simple ideological and unreasoned belief.

The difference between male chauvinism, sexism directed toward women and misogyny are very real and the issue needs to be clarified in this article.  Being chauvinistic implies a belief system, sexism implies a pattern of behavior, misogyny implies an emotional reaction.  Simply put a male chauvinist or even a misogynist can think or feel whatever he or she (yes a women can be a misoginist and no, she can't be a male chauvinist) want, but if they do not act upon those thoughts or feelings then they are not appropriately described as sexist.

This time I'm trying to add back citations (and including extra ones) that show the use of Adesc Aut in Ladin.  Ok, there is disagreement if it is proper usage or not, what is new?  Noclador says he knows Ladin scholars who are adamant against its use.  Ok, get them to publish something and we can cite their opinions and add it to the article.  I do not care.  He has become utterly obsessed that I am part of some conspiracy.   It was originally a user from the Netherlands who added the Adesc Aut ,because there are a few Ladin websites that use the term.  i added the an official trilingual document from Ortisei using that term.  Are they wrong?  Maybe, maybe not, whatever, we simply cite references, we don't cite what someone told us down at the local coffee shop.  But, I dare edit any page in Noclador/Gun Powder Ma's domain, and I must therefore be attacked.  If I'm banned for a week, those two should be banned for a month for their constant bashing of anyone who edits the pages against the way they feel things should be.

Thank you for the useful reference, Domer48.

""""==NPOV - Murder vs killing ==
There seems to be a bizarre NPOV inconsistency being raised over articles relating to people killed in Ireland. There are (1) victims of IRA / PIRA such as 86 year old Sir Norman Stronge, 8th Baronet and James Stronge; (2) victims of Loyalists such as Pat Finucane (solicitor), (3) “victims” of the British army such as Kieran Fleming; and (4) suicides such as Bobby Sands. There is a vocal and persistent lobby which is pro Irish Republican, many of whom belong to Wikipedia:WikiProject_Irish_Republicanism, which argues (I think) that a death is a killing until somebody is found guilty of murder even when that killing is generally defined and established as murder by law and in the international press.""""...(kiwiexile at DMOZ)  • """,0

I have not placed any cites as I did not write the section originally. What I think we can do is, go from here, place in the relevent cite requests, and attempt to clean up this section. NOTES- (1)I left in the last sentence of the first paragraph. While it might be seen as """"original research"""" it is a fact, I'd prefer to let it go with a cite request to at least give someone else a chance to make it better. (2)I left in the last three paragraphs which you think don't deserve attention, however it is true, and this behavior definitely deserves attention in a """"comments and criticisms"""" section. I think the problem here is that it is not a clean section. The current wording certainly is of an axe grinding nature, but can be cleaned up and sourced to become good information. Here is the original section I've pulled from-
Personally, I prefer this info to be integrated into the article more seamlessly, but I have accepted """"comments/criticism"""" sections as a necessary part of these types of articles as there tends to be no other way to share this information without damaging the integrity of the article. Insertion of information regarding Hitler's abuse of drugs after his assasination attempt, or Exxon's treatment of the Valdez incident, and subsequent hand wringing over the suit, to all be examples of pertinent info regarding individuals and companies that can easily be perverted to a non-objective position, but are still highly valuable when done correctly.
So this done, let's all take it easy. Those who think it is a poor section please leave it and place in your cite requests. Those who think it deserves to stay can work to find those cites and clean it up. This can and will become a good section if we let it be and allow for the open source machine to work it's magic.

Ultimately, there is one fact that is not disputed - Captain Asseline flew the aircraft into a stall. This is a very bad thing for a pilot to do at any time, and a cardinal sin when done 30 ft above the ground. The evidence is clear – the plane was at alphamax (high angle of attack), at very low airspeed, and with engine set to idle. Asseline has nobody else to blame for putting the plane into such a dangerous configuration, he was in command. All the other distracting issues, eg. precise altitude, wearing a headset, engine lag in responding to throttle-up command, etc etc, are little more than red herrings because none of them excuse the fact that the plane stalled due to pilot error.
There is a lot of evidence in the official report (I haven’t been able to find a version translated into  English), it’s pretty clear what actually happened.

Norman,

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site started as a non-commercial site and contains a great deal of island history as well as many, many island pictures. It's one of the most popular sites in the Lake Erie Islands.

Please take a look at """"Site Map Page 1"""" and """"Site Map Page 2"""" before removing the link again. Saying that the hundreds of pages listed there have only commercial value is idiotic.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

So what is your real rationale for deleting it again and again and again???

 Lying comes too easily to you Mr.Kannambadi 

Mr.Kannambadi, 

Do you know that your attitude is also an equal put off to those who wish to contribute genuinely to wikipedia, engage in healthy discussions and arguments?  It is obvious that trusting you to be sincere in your approach and thinking you to be respectful of fellow contributors, I come up with explanation, sometimes or many a times in detail about historical events. Mind you the expression detailed in victory and silent about defeats was the one given not by me but by you to Nishkid. 

Also, do not resort to blatant lying on these pages (which you are clearly doing, first by saying that I have no sources - be realized that others can also read and write - and second, you are deliberately with malafide intentions creating a misimpression in wikipedia that I was banned for abusing and lack of sources. Be informed that it was neither of those reasons, because the first time I was blocked by Blinguen, it was completely and absolutely without any reason and the second time Blinguen came into my page, he did not express any objections to my contributions or changes to the Chola page, but first he commented that he is blocking me for he thought my contributions were my personal opinions and because he blocked me, he first of all did not engage in any discussions with me or try to explain as to how to make postings in the right manner (though I had indeed sourced the material properly but had not referenced the same) with the result that I got blocked before getting to discuss or even adding the necessary references or citations.  But it is good, this way you are only exposing yourself displaying your lack of spirit of accommodation.

I think I have put it as succinctly as one can, but what can you do, you will go on yapping I am writing detailed messages and creating confusion and what not?  Do you remember the manner in which you so very contemptuously retorted upon my providing even the weblinks like visitchitradurga.com, unnecessarily resorting to instructing about keeping one’s patriotism under control…. That is the problem with people like you, when people give reasons you come up with such unhealthy excuses, when people want to discuss history instead of talking about sources and citations, you tell them to keep their patriotism under control or start alleging that what we try to contribute are devoid of sources or are straightaway our personal opinions. How wrong can you be?  Well, that’s how some people like you are in this world!!!

So your way is pretty clear; either avoid any discussion, remove postings and contributions or cry and complain behind the back, get people blocked and start blaming them by speaking and spreading all sorts of lies.

The next time you want to speak about somone abusing, pl. recall with all vigour in what manner you retorted to Mahawiki - you told him first not to """"soil"""" your talk page (what language and choice of words!!! and then you told him to go get the book by S.Kamat from a good library because you said such a library exists near your home..... if those are not insults, abusive manner of speaking, then what is.... but poor you, when I asked you to go and read Ancient India by either Roychowdhury or Sastri, you start looking out of the balcony!!!!!!

 Who is a vandal, Mr.Dinesh Kannambadi 

Do not accuse others of being vandals.  Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.

Now whom should the question be asked: whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas, when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 1160/65 and finally demised in 1189/1192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD?. This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were mainly consumed by their local rivals.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas in the page of the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them?  

Can we also be enlightened under what rules of Wikipedia not understood by vandals, is this kind of editing and then awarding an article such as this riddled with holes is permissible?

"agrippa pentagram man 

Hello Mr. Nixdorf.

I have seen your scan of the pentagram man on wikipedia.  I am writing a book and would like a bigger image (300 dpi at say, 5 by 5 inches.  I wonder if you have such a scan, and if you would give it to me or charge a fee and how much.  

The reason I am interested in the pentagram man is because I am writing about dynamic symmetry and how the pentagram and human body manifest dynamic symmetry.  I compare the pentagram man to the Resurrection of Christ by Piero della Francesca.  The book will be published by Seapoint Books (Smith Kerr Associates) in May.  

Please tell me if you can help me with a higher resolution scan.  Thank you

"They are all cunts 

It's not worth editing articles here concerning any serious issue. All sides consist of either people employed to edit or people with very strong opinions that will never, ever change. They advocate their stance as something that is interesting to them instead of using the encyclopedia as a book of knowledge and contributing what they are sure to know.  Soon with the centralization of the net into larger and larger sites, independent information in general will be extinguished. Wikipedia, a project that started by nerds and professionals within their set fields will become the altar of knowledge where depth and true insight is sacrificed for becoming the sound magnifier of yellow press and popular science. The new tool that is intended to auto translate articles from one Wikipedia to an other will extinguish the few national wikipedias that through their niche provide those of multilingual capacity an ability to cross-check facts through other perspectives.

"Glosbe does translate ezman as “heaven” (******) or “sky” (*****) and it back-translates “heaven” as ezman.

 Some definitions from Merriam-Webster Unabridged:

 Heaven. 1. a. … especially, the expanse [of space] that seems to be over the earth like a great … dome — usually used in plural. 2. a. … the place … of the blessed dead.
 Earth. 1. a.  … soil, ground. 2. the sphere of mortal life comprising the world with its lands and seas as distinguished from spheres of spirit life — compare heaven, hell.
 Sky. 1. b. the expanse [of space] appearing as a great vault … over the earth. 2. heaven (def. 2) — often used in plural.
 Tremble. 1. to shake involuntarily (as with fear, cold, excitement, fatigue).

 These two expressions are good idiomatic English:
 “If his wrath is aroused, the skies will tremble [in fear].”
 “If his wrath is aroused, the heavens will tremble [in fear].”
 Here the singular “sky” and “heaven” would not be used in good spoken English, only in mediocre written English.

 So we have a choice of eight ‘very good’ literal translations:
 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] skies tremble.”
 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] heavens tremble.”

 If you try speaking them aloud, you may find that this one sounds best:
 A. “YPG goes walking, and the earth and heavens tremble.” Something about the meter (the cadence) just makes it sound liks a military motto.

 The present-progressive clause “YPG is walking” would naturally correlate with the present-progressive clause “the earth and skies are trembling.” But we want to use simple present tense in the second clause.  (See above.)

 To do so, a native English speaker would begin with “YPG goes walking …”, because it combines both tenses: simple present and present progressive.

 But see whether you can come up with a better-sounding combination!",0

"Update of the Article, Chris Ojigbani
Thank you very much for helping me out in my article on Chris Ojigbani. It was my very first article here and I learnt from your help. After I read your message that I should put more references, I put them. Later I noticed that one of the refrences I put may not be permitted because immediately a warning tag came on the article, saying I should use secondary references. That made me to suspect that the reference I picked from the website of Pastor Chris Ojigbani may be the cause of the tag. I put a reference from the ABOUT US of Ojigbani in the space where the article says that he considers his ministry is not a church. So I put that reference because in the ABOUT US, it stated his ministry is not a church. But when I saw the tag, I removed the reference and was able to see an article from a newspaper that states Ojigbani's ministry is not a church. But after changing it, the tag is still on the article. I don't know how to remove it. Kindly help check the article and help remove the tags, if okay.

 was Canada's most important industry until the 19th century]]
Traditionally, Canada's Aboriginal peoples hold that they have resided on their lands since the beginning of time, while archaeological studies support a human presence in the northern Yukon from 26,500 years ago, and in southern Ontario from 9,500 years ago. The first Europeans to arrive were the Vikings, who settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows around 1000 AD, after which there was no further trans-Atlantic contact until John Cabot explored Canada's east coast for England in 1497, followed by French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1534. In the early 17th century, Samuel de Champlain founded the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal and Quebec City, from which the French colonists extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and the present-day Maritimes, while French fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana. Concurrently, the English established fishing outposts on Newfoundland and established the Thirteen Colonies to the south.
'' on the Plains of Abraham at Quebec in 1759, part of the Seven Years' War.]]

Due to the close proximity of these two European powers, a series of wars over both territory and the fur trade errupted between 1689 and 1763, such as the French and Iroquois Wars, the four Intercolonial Wars, and the Seven Years' War. Via the peace treaties that concluded these conflicts, Acadia and most of New France was ceeded to Britain, which then, through the 1763 Royal Proclamation, carved the Province of Quebec out of New France, annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia, and placed all the former French territories under common law; six years later, St. John's Island became a separate colony. By 1774, the Quebec Act reestablished civil law in Quebec and reaffirmed the right of its population to practice their Catholic faith, as well as expanding the province's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, all of which helped to fuel the American Revolution. From that conflict, some 50,000 persons loyal to the Crown fled to Canada, where new regions were created to accomodate them: New Brunswick was split from Nova Scotia, and Quebec was divided into Upper an",0

I think it's unfair that you would say that 'you doubt' that I am correct. All you have to do is to look at the pages that I've been talking about, you will see that EVERYTHING I havbe said is true. 
Why would you sit on your hands 'doubting' when the TRUTH is a few click away? Are you BLINDLY on his side or are you a fair person? Why not have a look? The truth has NO HOLES EVER!!

Ryulong HAS been bullying and tried very hard to keep a false QUOTE on the JEREMY CLARKSON page. Using sock puppets I was able to force him through the aid of other editors, to acquire the ACTUAL quote and SOURCE it... what a criminal I am huh?!

Ryulong on the other hand, repeatedly deleted my DISCUSSION TOPIC in his attempt to place the FALSE INCEST statement on the page.

If you are going to quote someone claiming that they've made jokes about INCEST, then you should back it up with a source.

Isn't WIKIPEDIA about accuracy and integrity?

It's all there in black and white.

Also - I did not email tons of users... I left messages on approx 4 pages. I thought I was messaging people that had problems with the guy too. AFTER I did that, I discovered that the guy had been nominated for ADMIN... this was really bad news.

This all started with a group of Anti-American editors that PROTECT the Jeremy Clarkson page. Both incidents have since been corrected as I was relying on fact not ambigous anti-American information.

I am not a BULLY. I am not politically motivated. I am not a vandal. My issues have been about FACTUALISING the political works of crooked admin who abuse the 3rr rule and cite PERSONAL ATTACK REACTION as personal attack.

I hope you will actually look into this. You seem to have taken a great interest in it, why not be wholesome and fair and look into my claim?

Thanks for reading.

YourCousin  

I'm honestly not here for a fight or debate, I just ask that you please look into what I've talked about (the bullying and dicscussion topic deleting) and let me know what you think. 

I have a proper USERNAME with nearly 2,000 edits. If I use that to communicate with you or edit the Jeremy Clarkson page, the ADMIN and editors there follow you around undoing your work and getting their ADMIN buddies to block you. So I have special IDs for such pages. Sorry. They made it that way. I DO NOT VANDALISE.

Today, I tried to tell my VALID story on Ryulong's admin nomination page and his #3 supporter, MR LEFTY was there within 120 seconds to delete and censor my story. This is unfair. The whole vote is now unfair because of such censure. 

If you are not crooked, then please at least tell me, """"YES, IT LOOKS LIKE HE DID THWART YOUR DISCUSSION AND TRY TO KEEP THE WRONG QUOTE IN THE PAGE""""... that's all. That's how it all got started. I am 38 years old, I don't find INCEST as funny as Ryulong.

Please respond. I would appreciate it.

Ha ha... I've just noticed that you're from TEXAS... I AM FROM MIDLAND TEXAS!!!(but living in the UK for now) 750 miles from Houston I think, but damn man!! don't you see who these Anti-USA guys are? Don't you recognize the Don't Mess With Texas attitude from me? LOOK AT THE REVERTS!

This all started because the page said that YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PASSPORT to buy a drink in USA and that machine guns are legal. This pissed me off because Anti American people in Britain thrive on this mis-information.  
My revert war with Ryulong was down to him wanting to keep a statement that said that ALL AMERICANS HAVE INCEST.. the quote was false, but he went al great lengths to keep it, stating that it didnt need a source. 
I think that if you say that someone else said that an entire COUNTRY(THE USA) has incest, that you should have to back it up. Isn't Wikipedia about FACT and ITEGRITY?

The page now has the real quote which is not much better but at least it does not say it about ALL AMERICANS and at least it's a real quote with a real source!

My comments were directed to the deliberate removal of all my references to primary source documents, and to the perception that Pearson and Nelson's books are reliable sources.  In some respects they are, but both books also contain egregious factual errors, and they cannot be cited without checking the 'facts' cited in them against the primary source documents.  Your comment that the transcripts and translations on my site are 'not considered a reliable source for information' puzzles me.  If you can demonstrate to me that anything in any one of my transcripts does not accurately reflect the content of the document in question, I'll be happy to change it.  I've striven to make the summaries as accurate as possible, and I think they are accurate.  Moreover my transcripts have the advantage of being in modern spelling, and are thus accessible to everyone, which the original documents certainly are not, being in Latin, and in various Elizabethan scripts.  As for what you term the 'glosses' and which I term 'summaries', their purpose is to summarize the sometimes very obscure content of the documents for readers, and to refer readers to other related documents on the same topic which they might not otherwise be aware of.  The 'glosses' (summaries) are thus a very valuable resource for readers.  But again, if you can find any instance in which one of my summaries misrepresents the content of a document, please let me know and I'll change it.  Re the Brinknell incident.

Notability of Your New Heart
 A tag has been placed on Your New Heart requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Hi.  The original """"Land Of Confusion"""" song/video were in existence for 2 decades before Disturbed decided to cover it.  Adding such an overwhelming amount of info on Disturbed's cover version distorted readers' analysis of the original song/video. (For what it's worth, I personally don't even care for Genesis at all, nor do I have any special fondness for this song/ video, though the video's puppetry was fairly innovative in its day.)  But I & others felt the article was being pillaged by Disturbed fans, and thus Wikipedia was being compromised in the process.  The article is much more fairly balanced now, and gives appropriate coverage to Disturbed's version.  So I have no regrets about how I edited it, nor do I have a problem with what you added back, since I think you added back a judicious amount... though the huge Infobox is pushing things a bit. (I only made that one edit to the article & had forgotten all about it until just now.) As user Robotman1974 posted back on Jan. 16th, """"Right now the word counts of the main parts of the Genesis version vs the Disturbed version are 775 to 996 respectively.""""  So you see, the word count (showing clear bias in favor of Disturbed's version over the original version) is what motivated my pruning.  I do welcome your further thoughts on this, though, since I realize Disturbed probably spent a lot of time and money on making that video, & they are a bit more highbrow than most """"nu-metal"""" bands of today. And I agree with you that their cover version is more notable than most, since theirs did very well on the charts (though I never even knew theirs existed until I stumbled onto this article).  The only recourse that would make both sides happy is to make an entire new article devoted to Disturbed's version. I would be in favor of that; this would allow you to add back all the info I deleted initially.

Best, and good luck in the governor's race,

Threat is a noun, and defined as:

1. An expression of an intention to inflict pain, 
   injury, evil, or punishment.
2. An indication of impending danger or harm.
3. One that is regarded as a possible danger; a menace.

As is rabidly apparent, none of these definitions apply in even the remotest of extrapolations.
My statements were and remain pure and simple defense against very blatant slander.

punish or inflict pain?)  Twist the context to suit whatever dreamworld you inhabit, D.G.,

 Sushi red snapper. 

I'm trying to figure out how to handle various fishes known as red snapper and mostly wanted to leave this link here for myself for future reference. There's a real mess with the species used in sushi; Japanese snapper claims that species is used, while Pagrus major says it is the species the Japanese common name """"madai"""" is applied to. Meanwhile, izumidai redirects to northern red snapper, but is apparently a term for sushi-grade tilapia which is what most often appears as """"red snapper"""" in Japanese restaurants in the US. 

The broader issue is that red snapper refers to many fishes throughout the world. Lutjanus campechanus is the red snapper of the southeastern US, and the only species which the US FDA allows to be marketed as """"red snapper"""" (but enforcement is non-existent). A couple species are known as red snapper on the Pacific Coast of North America, and it appears that snapper is exclusive to a single species in Hawaii and New Zealand.

A proposed deletion template has been added to the article Supercoach, suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process. All contributions are appreciated, but this article may not satisfy Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and the deletion notice should explain why (see also """"What Wikipedia is not"""" and Wikipedia's deletion policy).  You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the  notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on its talk page. Also, please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the proposed deletion process, the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the speedy deletion criteria or it can be sent to Articles for Deletion, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached.

"Thanks for the suggestion. I slept it over and hope that you are feeling more up to answering my questions about the edit in question. Specificaly: 

has the community not gotten smaller? 
was it not caused by the automobile? 
have I not sourced the statement as asked? 
is it not a fact? 
is it not information? 
does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? 
is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? 
is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not?

All that I'm asking is for you to explain why it is better to not have the statement than to have it. As far as I knew wikipedia is intended to contain the sum of all human knowledge. As someone who lives near Foresters Falls I find that this information answers a pertinant question left open by the article (Why is foresters falls so small if it once had lumber mills and such?) I know that you said you don't want to continue this dialogue but I hope that you can understand that my frustration comes from the fact that you have, so far, not explained yourself. from my point of view it seems that you made the edit on a whim and refuse to acknowledge the possibility that it may have been a bit unwarranted. I found the information in a book on local history, I have listed the book as a source as asked. What additional criteria need to be met? please tell me. If I were to refrase the sentance? Would that be better? In fact if you could tell me what criteria was used to determine that it should be removed that would be fine. Because I'm sure that this sentance is no worse (certainly not because it doesn't detract from the page in the first place) than any other statement on any other page. Why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement? Just because? Please answer this letter. Please do not throw another stock statement at me. Please do not respond to one statement I made in this letter and ignore any points you don't care to address. I would like you to meet me point for point and justify your actions. Please don't block me for daring to question administrators.

It's common for authors of reference books, particularly professors, to add footnotes after all and I find this to be a more plausible view. In my view, the way he is working over an entire article to achieve this is further evidence that, while it violates NPOV, he is not doing it maliciously as other self promoters do. His willingness to discuss puts him well above the bar of the usual self promoter. and he's not pushing his only publications as viable sources nor is he unwilling to seek consensus.

Yeah i thought there was a mistake when i saw that it said he was from 'Bermuda' but it turns out 'Paget' is a small parish of Bermuda where he must have been born however he must have welsh connections in his family, hence why he is a welsh international footballer.

"In an effort to avoid any future edit war, I wanted to discuss why I feel that the lead should be changed. As I've noted previously, the citations given for rap metal repeat links sourced later in the article. The reason that punk rock had been given as a genre was because it was the most commonly used term given in articles about the band, rather than rap rock, a term that is not used by the band. While it has been argued that Rolling Stone is a stronger source than some of the others, it should be noted that these reviews were written, as previously noted, during the period in which the band was signed to a major label, when the band received more coverage than it has while recording and releasing albums independently, and sources agree that the majority of the band's works (its debut EP, debut album, and all independent releases) reflect a punk influence, rather than a metal influence, and most certainly the band's most recent work is considered to be punk-influenced. Thus, taking into consideration that the majority and most recent of the band's works is considered to be punk rock, I feel that this is the genre that should  be given in the lead. (  )",0

[changes]

I am a USPS employee. I am not much of an author, nor am I a WP expert (so this is probably in the wrong place and horridly formatted, feel free to fix it), but there have been a lot of changes since the 'sorting mail' section was written. For one, the MLOCR's have almost been entirely phased out and their function is now done by DIOSS machines, which are similar to DBCS machines but have the ability to perform OCR function, as well as take images and spray ID tags on the back of pieces (for mail with addresses that cannot be read by the OCR software), as well as spray barcodes on the front. Also, the article seems to give no mention of DPS, which is a set of sort programs that take local mail (letters only, although the PO is evaluating machines that will do this with flats) and put it in walking (or driving) order for carriers to deliver. There are also lots of other changes, as well as machinery and equipment about which there probably isnt much public information, including the LCTS, APPS, RCS, FSM-100, and FSM-100-AI. There is also the entire PARS system, which is is quite interesting:
http://lunewsviews.com/automation/pars.htm
 —Preceding unsigned comment added by 216.46.197.119   

 Sorry not to be of more help, but... 
There's a contradiction between the first section which says the USPS is the third-largest employer and the employment section which claims it's the second-largest.  I don't know which it is, but someone should fix that.

Should be the third largest - behind The Dept of Defense and Walmart.  I have changed that three times - I will NOT do it again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.3.50.168   

Removal of 'Monopoly' section
While I removed the 'Monopoly' section prior to reading the discussion pages I firmly stand behind its erasure. The word monopoly is not an appropriate word to describe a quasi-government enterprise.  While describing the USPS as a monopoly may be true in the strictest of terms, the context of its usage is clearly biased.  Historically, the term has been used to describe private entities whose capital power has eliminated all useful and healthy competition. Furthermore, the word is charged with political and economic implications inappropriate for an objective article. By extension of the posters logic, the police, fire, military, the ‘Fed’, PBS, NPR, and others are violators of anti-trust laws as well.  While the USPS does not receive funds from public monies, it’s also not – as far as I know – legislated to make a profit.  Making the USPS the first ‘monopoly’ in the history of capitalist economics to ignore profits and losses altogether.
Your understanding of capitalist economics is somewhat incomplete.  Please review anarcho-capitalism, in which the state is viewed as having a monopoly on social services.  

There are no sources that deny that the USPS is a monopoly and numerous sources that say it is. Of course it is. Any good or service that has no competition is by definition a monopoly. The government forbids competition in letter mail by law. Being a monopoly doesn't require that you're violating anti-trust laws. The USPS is what's called a legal monopoly. I'm going to put the section back in.  01:25, 4 Septem",0

Hi Micky, 

Hey, not sure if my last message went out or not. My system sort of froze up for a bit and I could not log back on for a bit.

The gist of what I typed folows:

Not intending to be a smart aleck but the seal, as opposed to the coat of arms doesn't appear in color officially. I think Deb Markowitz, secreatary of stae for Vermont would back up that it is a single color device. I really do like the seal, it was deisgned by Ira Allen, and is refreshingly differnet from most others. Perhaps a trifle naïve in design but a nice device. It was designed to have dies cut for embossing so it is high contrast line art not showing shafiding or multiple colors.  

If you take a look at the staes of Maine, California, Michigan, you note more of a full color with shading and dpeth sort of treatment. these though labled """"seals"""" are all heraldically like a coat of arms. If we look at nations, like the Netherlands, UK, Canda, we see coats of arms. American civic heraldry is different. Vermont like many of our older east coast states has a coat of arms that is described by a statute, what can be called a blazon. Because vermont's coat of arms is so great I would love to see it used somewhere. Maybe as an illustration on the Vermont page, and as its own entry. If the word """"Seal"""" in the sidebar is boiler plate and can not be changed to coat of arms, could we use a solis dark green or medium gray without the color? And, possibly use the more colorful coat of arms, for the state links at botom of page. 

It's a thought. I grew up in Vermont. I see you are from Enlgand. What part? I am doing a signage and branding project in Sevenoaks, Kent at present.

Best,

Jim""",0

The major problem I see in doing this is that using only secondary sources, which I assume is desired, will result in an attackee timeline, for events during the attack, that's composed largely of McGonagle's recall of the attack (i.e., COI findings about events during the attack, and their sequence, are almost exclusively based on McGonagle's testimony; and the NSA History Report used the COI findings as a reference source).  So, for the attackee, the timeline may represent the """"official view,"""" as reported in NSA's History Report; but its base information source, McGonagle testimony, can be easily shown as being fraught with errors.

:Rock Band (video game) → Rock Band — There is no page at Rock Band or Rock band, as they're just redirects, hence no reason for the (video game) at the end. — (talk | contributions) 
Actually, there was an article at Rock band until somebody decided to merge it a couple of weeks ago (and that wasn't even a clear consensus). If anything, both should redirect to Rock music (which Rock band was merged with). So I don't think this is uncontroversial.  Spyke 
You beat me to the punch.  Clearly the term rock band is well used in the wiki and this needs to be discussed.  I think moving as proposed would be too confusing since the distinction is Rock Band v rock band.    
Dab That's what {{for}} is for. Simply put {{for|the genre of music|Rock music}} or somesuch. Either way, Rock Band should not redirect to Rock Band (video game). -·T·C·M 
Noting that a couple of thousand pages link to Rock band, and most of them refer to a group of people playing rock music, and not to a video game, I think we can't have Rock band redirecting to Rock Band (video game), as it now does. On the other hand, Far fewer pages link to Rock Band, and a higher proportion of them refer to the video game. Thus, as far as internal linking is concerned, it makes sense to have Rock band as a redirect to Rock music, and to move Rock Band (video game) to Rock Band, placing hatnotes on both articles. The alternative would be to have Rock band and Rock Band redirect to Rock music, and leave Rock Band (video game) where it is, with a hatnote at Rock music. The only reason to go with the second option would be if we think people are likely to type """"Rock Band"""" into the search box when they're thinking of bands playing rock music.  One other thing - why are we discussing this here, instead of at the article talk page? - 

I've just copied the above from WP:RM, where it was listed in the """"incomplete proposals"""" section. Consulting this talk page, a few sections up, it's clear that this page was just moved from Rock Band a little while ago, so before anybody decides to move it back, I thought I'd try to bring all the discussion to the same page. I would also direct the attention of anyone interested to Talk:Rock band, where I've left a comment about why that page really needs to say redirected to Rock music, unless someone does something about the 2300 broken links first. - """,0

Bass and Heneiken, for example, refer both to product and company.

"That's a very fair question. The answer is that there have been several court cases in which this very dispute has been at issue – besides George Harrison's 19th-century case, the main recent test case is that of Tim Saunders (around 1980ish? – I've got the date somewhere or other), who argued he didn't have to pay the poll tax because the Stannary Parliament had vetoed it in Cornwall. His case was thrown out, so the dispute remains unsettled. Besides the revived Stannators themselves, I'd actually suggest the people of Cornwall as a whole are party to the debate – and I don't just say this as a Cornish nationalist, Britain's a democracy, so its constitutional questions are a concern of the people.
There's also a sense in which it doesn't matter whether Cornwall is an ordinary county or not, and that is the question of whether we should think of Cornwall as part of England in any kind of non-legal sense. Think about the status of Merionethshire in the 1880s. Legally it was just an ordinary county of England-and-Wales; yet it clearly belonged to a specific 'country', if you like, namely Wales. Conceivably, then, Cornwall could be (legally) an ordinary county of England-and-Cornwall, but a 'country' of its own in a different way.
I know what you mean, in a sense – it doesn't seem like much of a dispute if Cornwall County Council isn't taking part.

3) Is designed to bring in profits to the vaccine manufacturers. (follow the money)
4) Was funded by eugenics groups to kill people. (the vaccination is far more deadlier than the flu)
5) Is a total scam and at BEST should be merged under the 'flu' article as a subnote (it's just another flu with eugenicist and capitalist overtones, maybe noteworthy as the most blatant attack towards the people of the earth in modern times by a governing body)

Like the CFers, I don’t think voting defines this issue, particularly when critical information has been withheld from the voters.  Let's look at tat briefly...

From the Wiki page on pseudoscience we find:

“As it is taught in certain introductory science classes, pseudoscience is any subject that appears superficially to be scientific or whose proponents state is scientific but nevertheless contravenes the testability requirement, or substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.[3]”

From the Wiki page on the scientific method, we find:

“Among other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.”

From my comments in the “Bias on both sides” section on this page we find:

The assertion that published studies on He in ‘cold fusion’ experiments came from air leaks, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

and:

The assertion that heavy metals found in cold fusion experiments comes from a) contaminants or b) improper analysis of data, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

And from my other comments on calorimetry (incl. edits to the CF  Wiki page), we find:

The assertion that apparent excess heat arises from an analytical method problem, that the CFers exclude these concerns based on a dislike of a proposed speculative physical/chemical mechanism that might or might not be a source of a calibration constant shift problem, while ignoring the mathematical fact that a 1-3% change in cal. constants can account for the large majority of such heat claims.  One fundamental aspect of the scientific method is the concept that if two alternative explanations exist for a given set of observations, then the situation is undefined and more new work must be done designed to test each alternative and distinguish between the two, because two distinct, conflicting explanations for a phenomenon can’t both be correct.  Failure to do that substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.  Failure to incorporate a viable alternative into experimental protocols produces a biased interpretation of the results.

Seems to me we need a new vote…     18:48, 22",0

 Might interest you.. 

In one of my linguistics courses, we studied the usage of the proper /ing/ ([ŋ]) pronunciation on present participles (ex- running, hopping etc) versus the substandard /In/ pronunciation (runnin', hoppin') among various social classes in the US. It was found that in working class families that the /In/ was much more common, even in formal interviews, with it being less often used when reading a text or passage. In middle class and even lower middle class families, the /ing/ was used much more frequently. I guess the point is, who's right?

 So in fact there had been no authentic """"dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article"""".

The article follows Wikipedia policy of WP:NPOV, as the article does not claim that the Omega Point Theory is true, but instead is written in the neutral point of view: it describes the Omega Point Theory, but it does not claim that it is correct. The article uses neutral-point-of-view language, such as """"According to Tipler from a 2005 paper in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics, he outlines the following reasons why he maintains ...""""

 In the edit summary of your first edit of this article, you state """"Obvious really, who the hell is repeatedly removing this categorisation?"""", referring to the """"Category:Pseudoscience"""" edit added by said person or persons engaged in vandalism, nonsense edits and disruptive edits. Your edit summary falsely makes it seem as if this edit has long been in the article, and that it has just recently been removed, which is incorrect. Your edit here also violates Wikipedia policy, such as WP:Truth and WP:NPOV. Prof. Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world's leading physics journals, and so under WP:Reliable Sources does not qualify as """"pseudoscience"""". Your phraseology of """"who the hell"""" also violates WP:Civility.

 You claim WP:Undue Weight for the latest factually-incorrect edits, yet almost the entirety of the peer-reviewed paers in science journals are in support of the Omega Point Theory. There has only been one refereed paper in a physics journal that was critical of Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory, but the authors of that paper unwittingly gave an argument that unless the Omega Point comes about then the laws of physics are violated, and so thereby actually gave a powerful argument for the Omega Point Theory's correctness. Tipler cites this article in support of his Omega Point Theory in his 2005 Reports on Progress in Physics article.

 Regarding critical reviews of Tipler's books, none of them have been refereed in science journals. They are book reviews that have not undergone the referee process that is required of actual papers.

 Prof. Tipler and his Omega Point Theory have been in the news recently. This has drawn the attention of ideologically-motivated people who upon hearing of it take an extreme visceral dislike to it. Because of this, this article and its associated talk page have recently been subject to vandalism and other disruptive behavior.

 Therefore, due to the foregoing reasons, you are here requested not to further engage in such factually-incorrect and Wikipedia-policy-violating edits.

 I will start a """"Criticisms"""" section which details the above information, but do not add factually-incorrect and Wikipedia-policy-violating tags to this article.

 Greetings 
I do not believe our paths have crossed previously, but it is obvious we edit some of the same articles.  As that is the case, I ask you: What are we going to do about this  character? -''''''The'FortyFive' 

I've already informed him that he violated wikipolicy by using a talk page as a rant page. Should he continue I'm thinking about a stronger warning, and then if it continues after that to simply report him. His rants indicate that he's unwilling to have some mediation. -   
I see no basis for mediation.  """"The article doesn't say what I want it to"""" and """"People won't let me rant on the talk page"""" are not valid arguments to take to an administrator or mediator.  I am not concerned, to be honest.  If he continues on his current course, he will end up blocked.  Cheers! -''''''The'FortyFive' 

I just thought that I would mention that he is back, and back to his old tricks.  Vigilance, comrade! -''''''The'FortyFive' 

Yes, I've been checking every couple days to see if he's come back. He's just not learning that this isn't MyFaceSpaceBook. -   
Ha ha ha!!  That is a great way to put it.  He does not seem to be interested in making useful contributions.  Mostly what he does is pursue his vendettas.  If he would be more cooperative, and not have such a combative attitude, he'd have a much easier time.  Oh well. -''''''The'FortyFive' 
Interesting.  I just took a look at his edit count, and 85.18% of his edits are to talk pages.  He's here to talk, according to the evidence, not to contribute to articles. -''''''The'FortyFive' 

 Wikiquette alert 

Hello, .  This message is being sent to inform you that there currently is a discussion at Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts regarding an issue with which you may have been involved.     Thank you. -''''''The'FortyFive' 
This matter has now been dealt with.  Cheers! -''''''The'FortyFive' """,0

 vandalism and prejudicial reverts by TheOldJacobite and others 
Well, it seems my concerns were justifiably founded then. It seem that this isn't the first time that TheOldJacobite has been involved with personal attacks, harassment and arbitrary reversion of articles.  That probably explains his attempts to have my edits removed, the page blocked and me blocked - requests that were ignored by Admin. I was quite shocked to read the log on him as it's clear that he hasn't learned a thing about courtesy to new editors, (quote) """"violation of reversion rules"""", or """"repeatedly adding inadequately sourced rumor"""".
I guess some people never learn which is a real pity, as the article is otherwise pretty sound.  TheOldJacobite just seems to want to own it, and not let anyone add anything of note to enrich it.
I think he should be reminded of Jimmy W's mission that Wikipedia should be open to all, and not just those who think they own Wiki, which they clearly don't.  No wonder Wiki is imcreasingly viewed as broken beyond repair when users of his ilk are allowed to bully and harass users over edits that are FULLY IN LINE WITH WIKI POLICY!

"Nature of the holdings in Mimms and Miller/“Police” vs. “peace officer” 

In carefully reviewing these cases, I cannot find support for the language I used several years ago, so I’ve revised it to strictly reflect what the Court actually said. Although the Court did not expressly require that a peace officer cite particularized concern for his safety, they did not expressly say that it was unnecessary, either.

The clarification of “federal law” is also important, because the Supreme Court, empowered under Article III of the US Constitution, cannot really grant “authority” to a peace officer; rather, they are limited to interpretation of laws and review for conformance with the Constitution, as they make quite clear in the citation from Mimms.

I’ve added a tag to the assertion that state law may not allow drivers or passengers to be ordered to exit the vehicle; though this assertion may be correct, it’s pretty sweeping, and needs support. It may be particularly significant in light of the Death of Sandra Bland. Many pundits have insisted that Ms. Bland’s failure to exit her car when so ordered provided cause for arrest, usually citing Mimms and Miller, and perhaps Texas Transportation Code §542.501. The Supreme Court holdings were of course limited to the Fourth Amendment, and did not (and could not) consider whether refusal to exit a vehicle after being so ordered violated state law; unless the Commerce Clause of Article I is somehow involved (and this seems unlikely), that would be a matter for state legislators to regulate, and state courts to interpret. Some states well may have done so; however, I have been unable to find anything close to dispositive, and have not seen anyone else do so. I am not going to make a project of running this down, but if someone else can provide this information, it would seem a great addition. Hopefully, any such reference would cite real decisional law that is unambiguous to the average reader, rather than a mere assertion by a third party (if the third party cannot cite authority, that party’s assertion is suspect).   

 “Police” vs. “peace officer” 
I do not understand the suggestion that “peace officer” or “law enforcement officer” is strictly the proper term needs support; I think the linked WP article makes it quite clear that either of these terms—which refer to a superset of “police officer”—are the strictly correct usage. I used “police” simply because in some other articles, other editors—usually IP—kept changing it to “police officer,” and the bickering seemed a poor use of time. And I reasoned that if the Supreme Court can use “police”—correctly or otherwise—we cannot be faulted for doing so here. Whoever added that tag did not give a reason; absent some good reason to keep it (or perhaps a suggested rewording of the note), I’m inclined to remove the tag.",0

"I notice that you everything you work on is related to Persians and other groups problems with those issues

May I ask you how you are an expert on such topics as scholars from the Middle East and their biographies or the Persian Gulf, and Kurds?  

 Oh, ya I also cited your statments about the fact that you wanted to cite that certain Muslim clerics have okayed sex with animals and children. How do you justify this statement and thought and even treat it like it could be true? 

IN reply to you this is what I observe, alongside others....
These are your direct quotes on the Khoemini discussion page ;

I had seen some literature out there suggesting that Khomenini approved of sex with children and animals. Now someone has added some of these claims into this article. I'm not going to take them out, but the article is going to receive a dispute tag until these information are verified. AucamanTalk 

Here is a direct quote from you to user:Pecher;
I've added some stuff about Khomeini's views on non-Muslims, but people might try to take them out. Could you keep an eye on that article as well? AucamanTalk 
This is verified on user:Pecher's talk page.

What is all the interest you and Pecher have on Khoeimini and other Iranian clerics. Also your articles on Ahmadenajid all show a disturbing trend that you are trying to paint some sort of picture. It is like connect the dots. 

Here are a list of articles you have worked on;

 Human rights abuses by the Iraqi insurgency
 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel
 Controversies surrounding Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
 International reactions to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy

Wow human rights abuses in the Iraqi insurgency! Very odd and specific topic! Ahmadinejad and Israel! The Mohammed cartoons. All your edits really benefit in making Israel look good compared to the rest of the Middle East. Answer me this are you an Israeli citizen too? I think you are on an agenda. All your edits against Iranians (from Kurds to Persians,etc.) since Iran is seen as the biggest threat to Israel and all your other edits in the Arab fields. Also trying being a force in tension between Arab and Iranian and Turkish editors. All at the benefit of Israel.",0

"Response to James B Watson 

Thank you for your reply.
 
Your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me. Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours. Given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them. I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not. So its ok for them to make personal attacks on me but when I criticise Blixx and co I get punished. One rule for one and one rule for another eh?
