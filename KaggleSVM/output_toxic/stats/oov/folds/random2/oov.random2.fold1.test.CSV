Airports
I wan't sure why you removed the info from the box at Palo Negro Airport. I used the only reference that is there to put in the information (World Aero Database) and it state the airport is 3,897 feet or 1,188 meters. Also the coordinates worked as I checked them out. Also if you look at Wikipedia:WikiProject Airports/infobox it says to use """"One of """"public"""", """"private"""" or """"military"""". Not """"commercial"""", """"general"""" or """"civil""""!"""". I like the idea of having the runway section centered as it looks tidier. I will bring this up at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Airports/infobox so the template can be amended and all the boxes will change.  Cheers.  (Talk) """,0

 Super Cup stats 

I've added the match stats from those games as it's a Football League-sanctioned competition, I did a lot of digging about on the internet to find the match details (goal scorers and attendance) but I can only find the line-ups from the Everton games from a third-party club website.  I've not added them to the squad statistics table as it would be incomplete, it would be grateful if anyone can find the teams lined up against Norwich.

I sympathize that the idea of a big bang is difficult but the scaling paper does not get round it, at best it just gets the log of time so 0 becomes minus infinity at the cost of making a lot of other things much more complicated.

Brews, I am fully aware of the difference between kinematics and kinetics. This aticle doesn't need to involve that difference.

You quoted above an expression for acceleration. That expression is correct. I am not disagreeing with it. But it tells us absolutely nothing that would enable us to solve a motion problem.

To solve a problem in motion, we need an input force. If it only kinematics, we still need an input acceleration.

We always need some kinds of contraints or known accelerations before we can determine a trajectory.

 Electrolysis of water 

As the article stands now, there is only a single, two sentence line about electrolysis, and it is all the way down in the Laboratory Sytheses section.

""""The electrolysis of water is a simple but expensive method of producing hydrogen. Typically the cathode electrode is made from platinum.""""

1st of all, this method is not more expensive than digging up fossil fuels, refining them, and then extracting the hydrogen.  Currently, the amount of hydroxy gas (H H O) produced from water is very much relative to the set up of the system, the frequency used etc.  Various voltages, amperages and frequencies have been used to various degrees of effectiveness.  The cost is, of course, relative to the source of electricity used.  There are many people who claim to be getting extremely high (even over unity) returns by using the resonant frequency of water.  Regardless of whether these claims are true, this method should be given more than a cursory footnote, as it IS very simple.  

2nd, produced on a mass scale (an ocean based plant using salt water and solar power for example) this method could be very reasonable, low maintenance, and environmentally friendly.  Remember no greenhouse gasses are produced by electrolysis.  Oh, and the cathode doesn't have to be platinum... it can be made from stainless steel or a number of other cheaper metals.

I propose mentioning this method and its long and successful history in the opening blurb, and giving Elecrolysis its own section.  The article now makes it seem like hydrocracking is the only viable solution... and there are numerous problems with that method; not the least of which being the scarcity and growing expense of hydrocarbon fuels and the pollution associated with using them.  The current article paints electrolysis as economically unfeasible and basically dismisses it off hand.""",0

 Reply to your question 

I'm curious as to why you (Mister Hospodar) conclude that everyone who disagrees with you (that is, everyone you've encountered on Wikipedia thus far) must be part of a nefarious conspiracy, and why they must be """"paid"""" by their """"bosses"""" to """"police"""" these articles. Leaving aside the various behavioral policies violated by such repetitive accusations, do you think alternate explanations are possible, if not likely? For example, is it possible that people edit these articles out of a desire to create a serious, respectable reference work - one that treats discredited claims honestly as discredited claims, rather creating a false impression of ongoing scientific debate? Could these nefarious editors possibly be motivated to contribute their free time to ensure that potentially important medical information here accurately reflects the knowledge of scholars and experts in the field? MastCell Talk 

In reply to the above question, I will state that NO, there is no other possible explanation for editors who take down within 30 minutes any edits that disagree with their agenda without considering the logic or validity of these edits, many of which edits greatly improve the articles in question; whose arguments funnel always into the same tired arguments and bullying, all of which adhere to a fixed political agenda and specific types of censorship; who are on call seemingly 24 hours a day for years to revert any edit which they think is damning to their agenda; who spend countless hours creating specious, illogical arguments and trying the time-worn tactic of  invalidating their """"opponents"""" with name-calling and fringe accusations; who ridicule and demean everyone, including established scientists, who disagree with their agenda; who are clearly not clever or informed enough to be operating on their own, say, as AIDS scientists or researchers who merely want to help the world with their knowledge; and who police a number of pages all related to the concerns of pharmaceutical companies, slamming alternative therapies and spreading disinformation about diseases.

However for those who truly """"hold life cheap"""", chemical and biological weapons are far more effective at leaving property/""""capital"""" undamaged and people dead, indeed although the US officially disbanded their BW program in 1972, the Soviet Union, despite also signing the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972, clandestinely continued the Soviet biological weapons program by reclassifying it as the civilian """"Biopreparat"""", with offensive weaponization of pathogens continuing in that facility right up until the dissolution of the state in 1991.[30]

While I agree with the above, it comes across as a rebuttal that seems out of place and goes on too long about biological weapons.

what context does """"enlargement of government power"""" belong here?
It does not belong. Progressives do not wish to enlarge government power for the sake of enlarging government power. Progressives believe that modern society needs government intervention to ensure fair play, e.g. government regulation, and to protect the citizens, e.g. universal health care. Beck believes these are fringe views, but I do not. TFD seems to believe that believing in Progressive values is fringe, but he would be on Beck's side with side with that.
""""You have taken the quote out of context and the source is a high school textbook,""""
It is from Brittanica, and here is the full quote:
Origins of progressivism
Never were superficial signs more deceiving. Actually, the United States already was in the first stages of what historians came to call the Progressive movement. Generally speaking, progressivism was the response of various groups to problems raised by the rapid industrialization and urbanization that followed the Civil War. These problems included the spread of slums and poverty; the exploitation of labour; the breakdown of democratic government in the cities and states caused by the emergence of political organizations, or machines, allied with business interests; and a rapid movement toward financial and industrial concentration. Many Americans feared that their historic traditions of responsible democratic government and free economic opportunity for all were being destroyed by gigantic combinations of economic and political power.

Actually there was not, either in the 1890s or later, any single Progressive movement. The numerous movements for reform on the local, state, and national levels were too diverse, and sometimes too mutually antagonistic, ever to coalesce into a national crusade. But they were generally motivated by common assumptions and goals—e.g., the repudiation of individualism and laissez-faire, concern for the underprivileged and downtrodden, the control of government by the rank and file, and the enlargement of governmental power in order to bring industry and finance under a measure of popular control.
This is very non-ambiguous
This is an article from Center for American Progress the biggest Progressive group in America, and in it it describes in detail the origins of the progressive movement and it's continuance today.
""""What is progressivism?
Progressivism at its core is grounded in the idea of progress—moving beyond the status quo to more equal and just social conditions consistent with original American democratic principles such as freedom, equality, and the common good. Progressivism as an  intellectual movement emerged between 1890 and 1920 as a response to the multitude of problems associated with the industrialization of the U.S. economy—frequent economic depressions, political corruption, rising poverty, low wages, poor working conditions, tenement living, child labor, lack of collective bargaining power, unsafe consumer products, and the misuse of natural resources.
""""As a philosophical tradition, progressivism in its most complete form developed as a “new liberalism” for a new century—updating the American liberal tradition from its Jeffersonian, small-government, republican roots best suited for the agrarian economy of the nation’s founding era to a more democratic and modern liberalism capable of checking rising corporate power. The original progressives argued that changes in the economy’s organization required a more complete understanding of human freedom, equality, and opportunity that Jefferson championed so persuasively. Progressives believed that formal legal freedom alone—the negative protections against government intrusions on personal liberty—were not enough to provide the effective freedom necessary for citizens to fulfill their human potential in an age of rising inequality, paltry wages, and labor abuses. Changed conditions demanded a changed defense of human liberty.""""
With the rise of the contemporary progressive movement and the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, there is extensive public interest in better understanding the origins, values, and intellectual strands of progressivism. Who were the original progressive thinkers and activists? Where did their ideas come from and what motivated their beliefs and actions? What were their main goals for society and government? How did their ideas influence or diverge from alternative social doctrines? How do their ideas and beliefs relate to contemporary progressivism?

 Allegations of anti-semitism

Agree forums of this nature are not reliable sources, and content lacking a reliable source should be removed.   

Adoniscik I am the right source to provide this information because I am talking from experience.  I had first written an angry letter to Cyprus Today in order to complain about some of our professors resigning due to the economic problems in 2005. It was published along with two responses which completely overwhelmed me with such claims that TRNC diplomas are 'worthless pieces of paper' and one other going so far as to say that EMU is a 'zoo'. I then wrote a second letter to defend the university because I felt my intentions were taken advantage of. I wanted to complain not trash the university. The following summer I had some work expierence which was not too bad but I still felt a bit uncomfortable about this newspapers stand to North Cyprus higher education. I did an interview with the Rector at the time Prof. Dr. Halil Guven which was not published. The next summer I translated positive artices from the Press office at EMU for 2-3 months and again they were not published. To be honest I have not been following what they have been writing since then, but as soon as I read that this article was written at Cyprus Today I am now certain that this newspaper has a negative stand point on TRNC higher education therefore, I do not think they are a reliable source on these matters. They cannot present the story in an objective manner.
As for the Israeli employees at EMU I can only provide again from first ahnd experience as one of his students that it was not anything to do with his nationality but honestly I don't think we were getting anything out of his classes. He just was not doing his job and at times making strange comments in his classes that were irritating students to the point that they would complain and sign a petition.   —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

However, I do want to mention that I have read many university profiles on wikipedia and none provide this kind of information about conflicts they have within the university.

This affected an estimated 200 high schools thus meaning thousands of students, this was also documented in New Yorks oldest paper Poughkeepsie Journal. He also was voted the Top Ten Most Influential Under 20 In The Hudson-Valley by the Times Herald Record. I was not able to site that because it will be in Sunday’s paper and has yet to be printed.

I was trying to keep it more balanced between shipwreck and treasure, as they are equally important, but without the Jewel pics (as they have not emailed me back yet) perhaps it might be better to spread them around.

I've deleted this bogus definition. I doubt you need references for a deletion, but here are some anyway: J. Pokorny, Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch (Bern and Munich: Francke, 1959), pp. 325, 504; P. Chantraine, Dictionnaire étymologique de la lange grecque (Paris: Klincksieck, 1990), p. 414; H. Frisk, Griechisches etymologisches Wörterbuch, Vol. I (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1973), pp. 638-9. These sources make it very doubtful that hêpar was related to hêpaomai.

I've also changed some text in the section on Liver Regeneration which asserted that the myth of Prometheus proves that the ancient Greeks must have known about the liver's remarkable capacity to repair itself. Actually this is a matter of some dispute. I've changed the text to reflect this controversy. I’ve looked at a great deal of literature on the subject and have found only one attempt to actually argue that the Greeks knew about liver regeneration: Chen T and Chen P (1994). """"The Myth of Prometheus and the Liver."""" Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 87(12): 754-755. I've added a reference and link to this. I've also referenced and linked to a historically detailed critique of this position: Power C and Rasko J (2008). """"Whither Prometheus' Liver? Greek Myth and the Science of Regeneration."""" Annals of Internal Medicine 149(6): 421-426. This is by far the most comprehensive treatment of this topic.

The addition of the above references made an existing reference redundant (ie Michalopoulos, George K., and DeFrances, Marie C., """"Liver regeneration”. Science, 4 April 1997: Vol. 276. no. 5309, pp. 60-66), so I removed it. Like a great many articles on regenerative medicine, the Michalopoulos article simply asserts that the Greeks must have known about liver regeneration, citing the the myth of Prometheus as its only evidence. Chen and Chen go much further than this. Likewise Power and Rasko.  

 Gray's image 

While accurate, the Gray's image is of terrible resolution and greatly inferior to other freely available images. While this 19th century image is of historical significance, I believe a modern, perhaps scalable, image would be more appropriate for an encyclopedic article.
  

Invitation to edit
It is proposed that Liver be part of the trial of a new template; see the green strip at the top of Pain where it has been in place for a couple of months. The purpose of this project is to encourage readers to edit, while equipping them with the basic tools. If you perceive a problem with this, or have any suggestions for improvement, please discuss at the project talk page   .

Excuse me, but I think you have got the wrong article; this is a scientific encyclopaedic page, not an art one. duh...

I really liked, when you said that there are many secondary (I think we are talking about reliable) sources which are simply Wrong. Well! The point is very clear, if you will read the Qur'an yourself, you will only see what you want to see. An expert knows that there are other verses as well which gives women equal share in inheritence, although it explicitly depends on your relationship. e.g. a daughter gets half the amount as son, but parents get the same amount and also in kalalah relationship, there is no difference in gender at all.

"""

I and I alone provided for mankind the most powerful machine since the dawn of time. I was foolish to think I'd get a meeting with the president or the Nobel peace prize. I guess I had my little finger cocked the wrong political way when I did it. Since this was known the forces that be have turned their evil cannons of jealousy toward me and ignored every rule in the book, played every unfair card in the book known and made as many unfair ones they could get their hands on to destroy me and steal it and gain credit for themselves on it. You have to decide if you are on the side of truth and life that I intended for this technology to bring or allow those lord high felons to destroy me with unfair and unequally applied rules. Are you going to be a part of that? Why do I say this? Because if I don't stand no honest person will forever thereafter. Have Wikipedia editors blocked William R. Buckley for the admitted first attack here and thereafter continual attacks, one short one and he's back at it,... or blocked SteveBaker for vandalism at all as he continues to do now and do as much damage to me he can? No. Or punished those dealing out blocks to me when they knew I did nothing for political bias? Did Wikipedia give me credit for my work and ban the copyright infringer and ultimate dark and threatening talker Freitas and Merkle  from this place NO! 

Wikipedia's rules clearly allow the publishing of lies from longer standing people of note, no mater how nefariously they slam the up and coming and tell lies far and wide and Wikipedia knowingly lets them. This is a media rag, period. Like any other. There are no real rules when they apply differently to one than another. Further, again, if you are being destroyed by unfair rules you have a Boston Tea party. Get it? It's called """"self defense"""" something you clearly do not understand. The only rule is a fair one and I don't see you or any other here trying to keep them fair in any way form of fashion you are just blowing political smoke. If you did we would not be here. I have not once been treated fairly and I don't see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here. You speak of rules, then block those that wrongly attacked me first before I even had a chance to play fair. Before I stuck my head out of the womb as a newbie around here. Don't walk away when I am being punished wrongly and you know it and above all don't drag my good name through the mud like a pig would do Mr. media guy. If you treat me fairly, you would be the first, from Larry King to Don and Mike to the Chief of police in Prince William County Virginia who had me arrested five times knowing I was innocent saying I was crazy for just talking about a self-replicator, even with my patent in my hand, gold seal and all (and you won't write of that here, not fairly). You want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now (but you wont). But most of all punish those who start the transgressions, not those fighting to defend themselves from the initial onslaught. And do not tell me you do not have special preferences around here.

I have contacted every lawyer on the list at the patent office and they will not sue a university professor (to answer you that question). Do me a fair article and you will never hear from me again because I am only here to fight a bad bio attack on me, that is all. I don't like Wikipedia because the rules are unfair here,woirse than any other media operation I've known.

Bullshit. """"His corkscrew senton finisher hasn't been called the Cancun Tornado"""". Why the fuck would you argue if you don't have your facts straight? Watch iDia de los Dangerous!, I guarantee you they name the move at least five times during the event. The fact that Ultimo Dragon uses the name for a different move doesn't matter. For example, in wrestling, for years and years, the name """"Last Call"""" was synonymous with a fallaway slam, but that didn't stop TNA from giving that SAME name to a superkick. Sometimes two different moves have the same name.

Elen, thank you for proving my point.  Meant seriously in saying so.  And no, I am not finished.

1, if Wikipedia is not a publisher of THE TRUTH (TM), it cannot then call itself an encyclopedia (Pillar #1).  It can, at best, and using your own definition here, Elen, be a publicly-accepted repository of publicly-accepted """"facts"""" accepted by the public.  I said that three times to make a point.  The repository is only made by publicly-accepted parties, the facts are also only those the collective shall accept, and the amount of verification is similar.

I point to the Wrestlemania XXVIII dispute.  This user has decided to use wikia-level """"evidence"""", but, since the public has accepted his stand, I am not allowed to challenge it.  And he's lying on top of it!  And if that, and other places I've attempted to edit, are any indication, this kind of conduct probably goes on all over the site!

The problem with the """"sports organization"""" (the BCS case) is that if that organization has removed the valid sanction of an event, then it creates an inconsistency between verifiability and damnatio memoriae.  If Wikipedia fancies itself an encyclopedia, then, it grants a sanction which no longer exists  in fact, it basically grants a status of """"fact"""" to something now ruled complete fiction due to the misconduct of one of the teams involved!  (And solely because the public accepts it.)  The problem comes in that Wikipedia, as an encyclopedia (and I will call this site on that again and again), grants a statement of """"fact"""" on something which is now fiction, because the public has decided that the event, since it physically took place, cannot be reversed, even if all evidence points to the fact that it should've been.

(And, yes, I will find the same farcical situation in many sports articles.)

And if I must find a """"published fact"""" for something, then personal knowledge becomes irrelevant to the process.  (The Final Fantasy case.)  If we are not going to trust the general public to do research (WP:OR), how do we trust the general public not to manipulate the """"published facts"""" (which see Mania XXVIII)?  Personally, speaking generally, I don't trust most members of the public (far beyond Wikipedia) to spell """"CAT"""" if they are spotted the """"C"""" and the """"A"""".  How am I going to trust them with a public repository of the """"facts"""" when they get to determine what is """"fact"""" and who gets to post it?  (Throwing out Pillar #2)

Ah, needs to be something the lawyer has signed.  I assert that hasn't happened in Cena-Rock, myself.  (One of my (ignored) claims was that the level of """"promo"""" of that match is the same as the level of promo in the Daniel Bryan intended-cash-in!)

And in stating """"These are some of our rules"""", you openly abdicate Pillar #5 by your own statement.  The choice is yours, not mine, because the public apparently gets to determine everything in Wikipedia as I said above.  How can I carry on an intelligent and informed conversation with someone like ChristianandJericho, who basically does not know proper English and chooses to type like a 12 year-old girl into a cellphone?  He probably doesn't even understand what I'm saying to him, frankly!  And how can I come to a consensus with a group of people like-minded to that?

At minimum, it's going to take a TBAN on pro wrestling and at least two IBANs on the two other users, for starters.  I can probably come up with at least a PBAN on a celebrity for a prosecuted 1998 criminal threat on top of it without even taking initial action on the page!    """,0

They seem to think that being an authority on some OTHER topic makes them qualified to discuss the issue.  It's not that Astrology is a psuedoscience, but that the debunkers are psuedoscientists.   05:35, 29 June",0

I thought I would check that using a couple of tools.

The rivets hold the strakes together and the lands should seal themselves when the boat becomes wet in use. If the building job has not been done well enough for this to happen, you are in trouble. In case someone does not know what a strake is; a plank is not quite the same thing as a strake but gives the general idea.

Whether a particular comparison to Hitler or Nazis is rhetorically persuasive or is excessive (and thus weakens the impact of appropriate comparisons) is not a matter of hard, objective fact (validity, or truthfulness) but, at least in instances where reasonable minds might differ, a matter of subjective appropriateness and degree.

Several years ago the New York Times published a letter of mine, but edited out my correct use of the subjunctive case. When I questioned the editor (very politely and deferentially), he explained the subjunctive is no longer used in modern English except for an assertion contrary to fact (e.g., """"If the Earth were flat, then ..."""")—which my subjunctive usage in the letter happened to be, although I continue to use the subjunctive wherever it is grammatically correct. Was I asleep when the subjunctive case was ripped from my language? Did the Anglos [sic] and Saxons posthumously defeat the Romans and seize linguistic dominance while I was away?

When I was in 4th grade, the teacher taught the class said that it was incorrect to begin a sentence with because. I asked why, and gave her a grammatically correct example of the usage. She acknowledged that my example was correct, but said one should not begin a sentence with because because that often leads to error (she was probably concerned about sentence fragments, e.g., """"Because it rained.""""). To this day, probably because of my resentment of the teacher dumbing down the language, I begin a disproportionate proportion of my sentences with because.

 Civility and stuff 

Regarding my last WP:FOOTY input, i have already replied you there. Here, i'll only add, other than a second apology to you, WP, WP:FOOTY and (some of) those concerned with some of the contents of my input: i can cope with being called """"stupid"""" (what's intelligence anyway), but VILE? Please think about what you wrote as well my friend.

Attentively -   
The events of the last week have been very disturbing and I was offended by what you said, so I can only imagine how someone who lost a loved one would've reacted to your comment. As I said before, think about what you write before you click that save button. Comparing a cheating footballer to a mass murder is wrong. talk 

I'll try to """"defend"""" myself once again, as i feel i did not manage it the last time around: i only chose that comparison to illustrate the level of vandalism occurring in the footballer's page (i did not compare anyone, i merely """"reasoned"""" - or did not! - if this occurs in a mere footballer page, what can be done with a real scumbag like that mass murderer and the ones like him), i only chose a very unfortunate example to guide me by. I guess you are very upset at me, and there's nothing i can say at this moment to """"turn back the tide"""", so i'll just be quiet for now...

No friends in real life, still have time to make enemies in the virtual world, even though i intend just the opposite -   
You don't have to apologise to me, I'm not going to hold it against you. It was an off the cuff remark and we all make them. If you look at the editing history of Sam Deering you will see an expansion I made after answering a request to do so. I found something unsavoury that he said during his time at Oxford United and in my edit summary I made a comment about his intellect, which I shouldn't have. You do a lot of great work around here and I have no beef with you, so don't worry about it. talk

It had the most support here, so people created Wikipedia_talk:Community_de-adminship/Draft_RfC. Previously, to remove a 'bad apple' a complaint had to be made at WP:RFC to get arbcoms attention. The CDA proposal is likely to be put through RFC to get attention too. It's more about removing bad apples though - it is something that will make admin think twice about the arrogant way they act.

"""

This is the memo that I meant - by the way my German appears really,really, really bad - the German version appears to be copied from the USA version. Of course this is just one of
many memos between the participants. I note that the memos that you put
forward, however, seem to show that the """"Jewish problem"""" was being
handled in ways other than gas chambers - ie deportation or sterilization
( both rather extreme injustices but not deadly - a little reading
shows that Hitler, Himmler,etc... could be quite squimish about 
killing people (ie the wiki article """"Night and Fog"""" sugggests as much).
There has been attempts to question this memo's provenace, however, this
memo is just one of several that follow the same theme - """"leave the Jewish problem alone, at
least till the war is over"""". If there was any gassing - or any murder of 
Jews - it was being done behind Hitler's back ( and  the backs of any
loyal/ambitious Hitlerites ), a not very plausible scenario, but the one 
the memos would force on believers. 

The memo I meant was:

""""Mr Reich Minister Lammers informed me that the Führer had repeatedly
declared to him that he wants to hear that the Solution of the Jewish
Problem has been postponed until after the war is over. That being so,
the current discussions are of purely theoretical value, in Mr Reich
Minister Lammers' opinion. He will moreover take pains to ensure that,
whatever else happens, no fundamental decisions are taken without his
knowledge in consequence of a surprise briefing by any third party.""""
July 1942

Unless some scholar can find a memo dated after this that reverses the 
policy - and I believe all the memos and actions taken by various people 
(ie Himmler,Luther, Morgan, etc ) instead tend to confirm the policy - 
it appears that finding a memo with a Hitler ( ie official ) connection
to the Holocaust is just a dream. ( Irving's $1,000 - or whatever amount - seems safe) I hope this memo can make it into the article - ( he may have been a nasty guy but honestly he was 
probably just a bureaucrat, that seems to be the treatment he 
received after the war by people on the scene). 
Browsing/reading the German language wikipedia - I am not really a good
German reader but correct me if you are - version of this article it
appears they also avoid the relevant memo, but of course they have the
fear of prosecution over their heads. In America our reluctance, at least, isn't legal. 
Finding the Luther memo, it appears this memo is of an even later date. 
It is even more revealing as to what the policy toward Jews was during the war.
All Jews were to be expelled from Europe after the war was over - so it 
appears Hitler was not talking gas chambers,etc quite late in the war. 
Memos of this sort seem to crowd all the Holocaust gassing,etc into a
very small time frame - an impossibly small time frame, probably why the 
memos are ignored by all right thinking people.  

PS I just found out that the Luther memo has a long history. It has been ignored 
since at least the 1970s. I thought this was a relatively recent discovery
by scholars etc - it appears to just be an old unanswerable embarrasment

Comment Hi There, In spite all my effort, I don’t expect any understanding or help from the other side regarding the English version of the article about Alexander Voytovych. Therefore if one insists on deleting this particular article then go ahead as it seems to me there is no room for democratic thinking on your website whatsoever. I’d like to add a few more words as my final statement. Wikipedia says:  “Sources may encompass published works in all forms and media, and in any language. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability. The art works and art life of the artist is the sourcefor academic press, Ukrainian media, academic institutions, as well as poets, writers and publications use his paintings & drawings to illustrate books. The artist takes a part in a busy art life in the Ukraine presenting a number of exhibitions & art projects. Having said that I see that there is no enough evidence for one?????

If one convinced that the article has to be deleted, than do not hesitate to do so, but before that please give me a straight answer to my question. What is the difference between the article about Alexander Voytovych and, for example, the Herb Roe’s article, why the mentioned article is considered more accurate? I must highlight once again that instead of explaining what has to be changed or corrected on the page, one awards us with thenoticeboards. Regarding self-promotion  which was mentioned a few times I’d like to make it clear  the artists is a Ukrainian and naturally all sources are Ukrainian, and if the mentioned language is unknown to one it doesn’t meant that it allows one doubts the genuine sources. The Ukrainian and Russian versions of Wikipedia have accepted the article and honoured it, which says a lot.I had in my mind to present more Ukrainian artist, however having such an experience; I’d rather leave this business behind thanks to you. Thanks for co-operation. From my point of view this discussion is exceeded, feel free to delete the article!

The best thing to do would be to find a couple of other sources about Hammond, talking about his project, and link those; newspaper articles work, as do gallery notices and exhibit reviews.

""": Yeah, well I enjoy ranting but have gotten to do ever-so-little of it thus far on Wikepedia because of the whole infernal """"Wikiquette"""" thing. I couldn't resist the opportunity to indulge a little. ) Here's the dilly (or part of it) on dopamine, melanin and Parkinson's. Dopamine and melanin have very similar structures, and dopamine metabolism produces a form of melanin called """"neuromelanin,"""" which is different from eumelanin, pheomelanin, et cetera, but still certainly a melanin. Neuromelanin gradually accumulates in the neurons of the substantia nigra throughout a person's life. Kids have very little, elderly people have lots. When people get Parkinson's they start losing their neuromelanin, and their SN goes pale. The fairly recently-published histology and pathology books I'm using just take it for granted that the loss of neuromelanin is basically a side-effect of dopamine depletion. But I may have been a little too confident in assuming that that's the final word. I just checked the National Library of Medicine website and a bunch of new research is turning up more immediate connections between neuromelanin and Parkinson's than had been suspected. Also, it looks like they're also getting promising results in studies on therapies that involve endocrine manipulation of neuromelanin. Still, all of this specifically involves neuromelanin in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and I haven't personally learned, heard or run across anything stating that there is any connection whatsoever between skin melanin and Parkinson's. But I guess the take home message for me is that there is more going on here than I realized, so I can't write off the possibility that there is alsothough I can't imagine howsome emerging connection between neuromelanin/Parkinson's and a person's skin melanin levels. Anyway, as you say, this article is about melanin generally, not just skin melanin in humans, so regardless the Parkinson's link is legit.  19:57, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 The below former counties of South Pyongan were merged with Nampo in 2004 and are administered as part of that city:
 Chollima-guyok (천리마군/千里馬郡)
 Kangso-guyok (강서군/江西郡)
 Ryonggang County (룡강군/龍岡郡)
 Taean-guyok-gun (대안군/大安郡)

This looks weird. Each former county was formerly named 군. When merged wit Nampo, some were renamed 구역. The parenthetical Hangul names are the former names (why not, this can be an editorial choice). But the Roman names should be either all new or all former. We should have either Ryonggang-gun or Ryonggang-guyok (according to the actual name). And either Taean-guyok or Taean-gun.

"""
 Trimming sounds fine, but where a dispute comes up, I would recommend slowing things down.  Focus on one or two specific quotes, and if someone reverts, instead of immediately reverting back, try to come up with a compromise version.  Ditto with the other person reverting, instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version, try to come up with a compromise.  With each person changing each other's work, rather than reverting, it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. Also, use clear, calm, and neutral edit summaries, referring strictly to the article, and not the editors.
 In terms of refactoring, what I was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to.  When a post is phrased such as """"You did this wrong"""" or """"He is unwilling"""" or """"He's just always stubborn"""", then that's getting away from discussing the article content, and is veering off into discussing the editors.  Better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors.  Good habits to develop (though they can take  time to get the hang of it), are to avoid the words """"you"""" and """"your"""". Also, avoid naming specific editors in a post, as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive, and then they may miss everything else that's said. Instead, when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done, diff the edit without mentioning the editor.  Like, """"I disagree with this edit (diff), as I feel it's a violation of (policy/guideline).  A better way to handle things would be (suggestion)""""  I know it may sound a bit confusing to do this, but I have seen that using this kind of third-party discussion technique, can work wonders in de-escalating disputes.  It also tends to make whoever is using the technique, sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful, even if off-wiki they may be hopping mad. ) It also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action.  When an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute, and they see everyone yelling at each other, the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong.  The admin won't care """"who started it"""", they'll just address things as they see them in that moment.  But if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly, and one editor being uncivil, then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption.  Caveat: Just because one editor is being uncivil, doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the wrong.  But if the discussion has degraded to the point where all they're doing is name-calling, rather than actually discussing the article, then that's a problem that an administrator can easily address, by removing the non-constructive editors from the discussion. onka """,0

That is understandable and will not happen again. But people ganging up and abusing their athority to take down a company who has done nothing to them is crazy. Once an editor who has a grudge or motive decides to remove a listing the rest join in and agree because one person decides to disagree. It is not proper form and there should be rules against that as well. Their should be special top editors for each type of thing......like toys for eg. That way people can't just gang up and remove something because they think it is power to do so and will hurt the person who wanted it to stay or took the time to create it.

Discography
We should be able to come up with a definitive list of commercially released albums and singles. Let's start with the headings. 

Officially Released
Self Released
Singles
Out of Print Compilations
In Print Compilations

Those should be in sentence case. Do folks agree on those headings? - 

 I think those sound reasonable. I have changed them to sentence case, and re-added the record covers which were deleted from the discography by Jonah. I also re added the descriptions of Rose's musical style that were deleted without explanation. Finally I re-incorporated a new version of the sentence dealing with racism and antisemitism. It makes not direct claims about Rose's online work, only that it deals with race and religion. Then I wrote that this has created a series of accusations of racism and antisemitism in various online chat groups. While online chat groups are not officially a source, the fact remains that these criticisms are out there, posted in various places. I think that this should satisfy both SP (by being NPOV) and Ayers (by bringing up the issue).  Hope this helps. I agree with Will, let's move on.  

I do wonder at the designations of """"self-released"""" vs. """"officially released."""" At what point does one become the other? """"Bone Again"""" and """"Elizabethan Period"""" were funded by people or companies other than Biff, and given professional print runs of a few to several thousand; they were distributed through non-internet indie channels, and reviewed in Mojo magazine.  """"Roast Beef"""" was pressed using Biff's royalties, but then it was picked up by a distributor who slapped their own record label's sticker on the cover; several thousand were produced and sold.  """"Hamburger Blues"""" was an """"official"""" release that may have been a smaller print run than some of Biff's website releases.  """"Uncle Jesus"""" was a major label album that is harder to find than """"Roast Beef."""" """"The Pickwick album was an """"offical"""" compilation of far seedier origin than some of the indie releases.  The whole issue of """"in print"""" vs. """"out of print"""" is a bit difficult to assess as well.  If copies are sealed, stockpiled and available, isn't the album still """"in print""""?

My concern with these categories is that they tend to appear at the same times that text changes are made diminishing Biff's accomplishments; and they seem to be included as part of the intent of that effort.  If you look at other artists' discographies, these distinctions are rarely made.  For example, see Sun_Ra.  A great many of Sun Ra's albums were self-released, including most of the artistic milestones.  It is a vague and misleading designation.  Why not go for straight chronology?

And to confirm Marcuse's interpretation, I was not implying that Marcuse initiated a given edit.  Is someone trying to start fights where they ain't?   

The problem here is that you wrote something, a line that went unsingned, but on closer inspection was found to be added by you but attributed by you to someone esle. You then followed this by saying that you agreed with the line. Very unwiki of you.

Indeed, someone is trying to start fights where they ain't.   

 Wallawe/Jonah, I'm curious what the """"released on cdr"""" that you keep adding to the discography means? What is cdr? As far as the self vs. officially why don't we just simply put """"Full length releases"""" and combine them?  

In most of these cases """"cdr"""" is not an accurate designation.  Some of them were glass-mastered CDs.  But as I said above, I don't think that's too important, anyway.  

, you claimed to revert back to Marcuse, but you did not.  That's a super-misleading tag.  

And now I understand what you are referring to:  .  That's something I do a lot.  It's called """"Paragraphs.""""  Here, I'll do one right now.  Here goes....

I did not ignore your response; I thought my answer was clear  but I'll ride the donkey for ya. 
 A single section containing criticisms is an example of a poorly structured article as it means that people reading about a subject have to look in the section about it for the 'non-criticism' and then a second section to see if there is any criticism. This is a statement to which I have refuted wholly by showing you an example of an article that is not porrly (rather, superbly) written; also, the criticism section does nothing but DESCRIBE the criticism involved with the topic (eg. why/how/what re criticism of the Canadian Charter...) See?
Naming a section 'Criticisms' or something similar is giving Wikipedia a POV. Specious. We wish to DESCRIBE the criticisms, not create them. We therefore need a section do do so. (I concur, though; forking is counter-productive. Man you got a little pet name for everything.)
*...such a section is normally just a troll magnet and POV magnet, making things difficult to manage. First, that is tantamount to cutting off your nose to spite your face: crappy articles because a good one would attract undue attention? That's silliness. Moreover, good articles are far less likely to be attacked by vandals. And lastly, protect the pages once well-written - don't make drivel out of the article just because writing it correctly (i.e., like the featured articles) would attract attention. Change the management method instead.

On top of all that, I submit that this PETA/AR debacle is so controversial for no other reason than that the articles are poorly written. They are biased, they are agenda-driven, they lack recognition (DESCRIPTION) of criticisms and they are quite obviously over-protected and coddled over by people who truly don't want criticism to see the light of day.

 An atttribution would certainly be nice, and I didn't put it there, but it's certainly on the mark as to how some viewed it. I've seen Hearst Movietone newsreels from the period, and that is pretty much the picture they present. It's also the rhetoric to be found in Franco's speeches during the war. It had very little basis in reality, in my opinion, but leaned heavily on communist atheism and anitclericalism, and the destruction of churches (and  in some cases  torture, murder, etc. of clergy and members of monastic orders) that occurred in the opening weeks of the war. I think the article is accurate in saying that the atrocities in those opening weeks were roughly equal, but the fact that many on the Republican side targeted the Church was endlessly exploited in the Nationalists' rhetoric, and struck a note with conservatives elsewhere who otherwise might have kept more distance from fascism.   17:55, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Pro-Nationalist link
I for one am inclined to keep, for the moment, the recently added Professor Marek Jan Chodakiewicz on The Spanish Civil War. There ought to be at least one external link to a site more sympathetic to the Nationalists than to the Republic. However, I don't think it is a particularly good site: there must be a far more comprehensive presentation of this case (maybe even with some decent footnotes and/or external references itself?) elsewhere on the web. If someone could find a better one and substitute it, I think that would be an improvement.   

 Not Neutral 
I added the note """"The neutrality of this article is disputed."""" because of the insistence in that General Franco or his forces were fascist. This is just communist propaganda. We know better now. Communists wanted to overthrow the legal system of liberties in Spain to create a system similar to that of the Soviet Union. General Franco and his coup prevented that. Of course, the Republican legality was not restored, but that was because it had not proven safe from revolutionary risks. And Monarchy was not restored probably because King Alfonso XIII fled the country only because his partisans lost a municipal ballot, so it appeared to the victors in the war that that king was not reliable to grant individual rights. Of course, Franco's Dictatorship is more than objectionable, but it does not prove that it was a fascist regime.

(this was unsigned, but it's User:Makjavelo

 Frankly, I think this one characterization does not make a non-neutral article. I disagree with much of what Makjavelo has just written, but I do agree with him that the article (or maybe an associated article) might gain from a more extensive explanation of the somewhat complicated relationship of Franco's politics (and Falangism in general) to fascism as such.   17:44, Jun 8, 2004 (UTC)

 This seems like petty apology for Franco, in my opinion. Not only the communists, but the anarchists, socialists and most Republicans refered to the Francoist forces as """"fascist;"""" as well as many historians and authors, e.g. Hemingway. I forget the exact quote, but a Christian clergyman (who were notoriously right-wing at the time, in popular belief) stated that Franco's regime was totalitarian, because he """"controls all aspects of one's life,"""" which can be argued because of the high degree",0

These four sites reflect the sequence of the four important phases in the protohistory of the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. The sequence begins with the transition of nomadic herdsmen to settled agriculturists in eastern Baluchistan, continues with the growth of large villages in the Indus valley and the rise of towns, leads to the emergence of the great cities and, finally, ends with their decline. The first stage is exemplified by Mehrgarh in Baluchistan, the second by Amri in the southern Indus valley and the third and fourth by Kalibangan in Rajasthan and by Lothal in Gujarat.  In other words, the language changes when IVC is discussed.

Justin Vaisse's opinion
This relative absence of French-American political and social unity helps to explain anti-French sentiment in the United States. French historian Justin Vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward France in the United States is the small number of Americans of direct French descent1. http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=12&id;=228&content;=synopsis. While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, """"A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon? The Washington Post's Coverage of France"""", French Politics, Culture & Society, vol. 21, no. 2, summer 2003.
 Just to answer, I've read before that the proportion of french descendant in the US is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the New World at the same time as the Brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly, they were mixed into the mainstream america. However it's true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they don't represent or try to represent.  """,0
"Gilles Tréhin

I have listed this article at WP:DRV for possible undeletion based on information I have received regarding a book that has been written by Trehin about his fictional city, Urville.  Interested parties should contribute to the discussion.  

Is this still deserving of featured article status?

I'm beginning to think that this article should be removed from the list of featured articles.  It seems to me that political ideas and attempts to be politically correct have compromised the factual veracity of this article.  This should be a pretty straightforward article about a neurological disorder like epilepsy or aphasia.  Instead, it reads as if Asperger syndrome is either some kind of blessing or lifestyle choice and that there are negligible drawbacks to having it.  The very fact that many of the participants on the talk page take issue or offense at even calling AS a disorder or disease when it is viewed as such by the medical community is rather telling.  I really think the mainstream medical and scientific view should be emphasized, as medicine and science strive to have the neutral point of view that this article lacks.  I'm not looking for an argument.  I'm simply warning those interested that if this article stays as it is I will probably lobby to have it removed as a featured article.",0

Ditto on GAN. To me, the article is ready, though I still intend to make some minor edits. On another front, I think we ought to leave the dating issue where it stands, even though I disagree with Heylin's assessment of mid-July, which he guesses at based on the fact that BoB made its debut on the charts on July 30 (see Shades, p. 264). I find that ridiculous. For example, BIABH took six weeks from its official release on March 7, 1965, to reach the charts (May 8). Highway 61 got out much quicker, with a one-month lapse from its August 20 release before charting. Going back earlier, Another Side took about six weeks to chart and Freewheelin', more about than three months,  Using mid-July, then, means giving BoB  two weeks to debut, which is absurd. Of course, the whole problem centers on what is meant by """"release."""" In this case, it's being used to mean distribution, which was obviously delayed in BoB's case. However, the Billboard advertisement of June 25 gives at least three other clues to that: pressing, packaging and promotion. With those three in place, distribution couldn't have been more than a week behind if not already in motion.   """,0

 Withdrawn charges 

The London Free press also reported that his charges were withdrawn silently. Now from the perspective of a normal criminal process, this usually means the police had a weak case. The fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all (judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case). In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.

What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.

To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in """"enforcing"""" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your """"administrative"""" tasks. That would be classified as Administrator Abuse Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_abuse.

Roy, good questions. Yes it's actual thrust data from the Columbia mission, STS-107. However you can't directly measure thrust. Rather it's calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure. Also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust. In actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing, even if engine thrust was constant (which it's not for the SRBs). I include below some more info I was preparing to post:

Because of the frequent confusion on this point, I uploaded a thrust/time graph for the SRBs. I also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this. SRB sea level liftoff thrust is 2.8 million pounds each. Each SSME produces 393,000 pounds sea level thrust at 104% power level. Thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is: (393,000 * 3) + (2,800,000 * 2) = 6.779 million pounds force, or 3.075 million kgf, or 30.16 MN. Using these numbers the SRBs provide 82.6% of liftoff thrust. 

This is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 3.3 million pound thrust number, some even erroneously adding """"sea level"""" or """"liftoff"""" thrust. There are six possible thrust numbers for the SRB:

 Sea level liftoff thrust
 Sea level peak thrust
 Sea level average thrust
 Vacuum liftoff thrust
 Vacuum peak thrust
 Vacuum average thrust

The problem is most references don't state which they are using. This is why references state SRB thrust from 2.65 million lbs (probably sea level average thrust) to 3.4 million lbs (probably vacuum peak thrust).

When comparing SRB thrust to, say, Saturn V F-1 engine thrust, you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type. The F-1 is not throttlable, so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust. At sea level this is 1.5298 million lbs per engine or 7.649 million lbs thrust total. By comparision the SRB thrust changes over the burn time (see chart). Space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6.779 million pounds force, or about 88.6% of the Saturn V.

In theory you could compare the SRB thrust at T+20 sec which is somewhat higher, but that wouldn't be liftoff thrust.  """,0

 The British National Front was and is 'far-right', yes? Let's not whitewash in this article. 

In putting the term 'far right' before 'National Front', and removing the uncited last line that appears to promote Griffin (""""Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""") I have been reverted and accused of 'vandalism' by a regular editor here, User:Parrot of Doom. I would like to say that nobody WP:OWNS Wikipedia articles, and it is against Wikipedia policy to use the term 'vandalism' for an essentially 'POV' issue (POV means someone expressing a point of view) - especially one that is effectively factual - namely the NF being 'far-right'. Wikipedia describes the NF as """"a far right and whites-only party"""" in its main article - and this fact was as true when Griffin was a member of it as it is now. I also gave the clear reasons for removing the promotionally-phrased last line - so I'm not a vandal.

Having maintained that the National Front is indeed 'far right', can anyone really claim that adding this fact to this article is unhelpful or irrelevant? The current introducton gives very little real flavour of Nick Griffin (and his obvious 'notoriety' is left out completely), which compared to other Wikipedia articles on politicians is pretty scandalous in my eyes. Why be so accommodating to Griffin of all people? It looks like whitewashing is going on to me.

We need to do some work here people, and pull together some references:  there are plenty in Nick Griffins case!   """,0

 POV statement which couldn't be salvaged 

I removed the following statement from the article, hoping that someone will rewrite this.
""""Former CIA agent John Stockwell, who was stationed in Angola while working with the CIA, argued that the CIA murdered 10,000 Angolans by arbitrarily warmongering.http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htmhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35COXObeo8""""

Reasons I think it's POV:
""""arbitrarily"""" - Please elaborate, and explain how this is relevant to the article
""""warmongering"""" - I think this term is rarely appropriate in an encyclopedia, and certainly not here.  There are many other better words.
The 10,000 figure isn't even mentioned in the article itself.  So, if it's not important or noteworthy enough to put there, why does it belong in a broad article about the country?
The 10,000 figure appears to come from his recollection.  Since when do we rely one person, an activist at that, to be the sole source for a casualty estimate?
The U.S.'s involvement is more of a side note here, and does not really fit in with the rest of the description of Angola's history.  In another article about, I don't know, CIA activities in Angola, maybe, but not here.

 Since I feel that this is an important topic I have made an effort to update and improve the article, although this is not an area of expertise for me and this has limited what I am able to do. As I see it the purpose of the article should be, as with articles such as Automotive industry in the United Kingdom or Automobile industry in China, to provide a concise overview of the industry including its history, current state and economic impact, important products and companies. 

 I agree that the list of first flights is not appropriate. In my view this should be changed into a prose description of the history of the industry, with some of the first flight details being woven into the text as appropriate.

 I have started trying to improve the 'Major participants' section but in my view this requires more work. The 'Current developments' section contains a lot of interesting and useful information but appears to need some updating. 

On a minor point I see that you have moved Thales from the overseas to the domestic section of the paragraph in the lead on major participants.

Given the unique nature of comicbook material, we give them leeway on relying a good deal on primary sources.  It's only when those articles seeks something beyond a C, such as GA or FA status that third-party sources become imperative.

Do you give leeway to small-interest articles in because we have nearly infinite resources, or do you hold everything to the rules?  Personally, I lean more toward keeps than deletes, except for extreme cases.

In any case, I Rictor may pass for GA.  You can check out a similar character I worked on and moved to GA (Anole (comics)).  That really go there because I trimmed through FCH, and had a lot of third party sources on some plot lines that involved him and the character's creation.  The layout for an FA article would probably cut through a lot of character history and focus on publication history.  It offends some people to see what they consider """"notable character history"""" cut, but if you want an accessible article, you have to do it.  Superman arguably has a ton of character history, but it's really just distilled down to the basic iconic things that others write about: Krypton, orphan, country boy, Metropolis, Louis Lane, Lex Luther, Justice League, etc.  I'm trying to find the time to do the same to Jean Grey.

A Nursing Model – Hildegard E. Peplau from Townsend, M. Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice. Chapter 1, 25-28. 6 ed. F.A. Davis Company. Philadelphia. 2014.

The referenced literature presents the Nursing Model of Peplau is based on an interpersonal theory structured on the nurse-client relationship development. Peplau created the Psychological tasks as a learning process which nurses could help their patients achieve personal maturity, since their illnesses have been caused by breaks or failed development during this process. The four Psychological tasks are learning to control others, learning to delay satisfaction, identifying oneself, and developing skills in participation. These stages are classified by age, childhood, following concepts developed by Freud and Sullivan. There are some important understandings about Peplau’s nursing model: Nursing is a human relationship, Psychodynamic nursing is a tool to oneself and other-selves development, and Rules are social establishments important to keep functional the social structure. As an example of nursing rules Peplau define social actors as a stranger, resource person, counselor, teacher, leader, technical expert and surrogate. These actors have an important function to improve the relationship between nurse and patient. The nursing-client relationship is oriented by four phases, Orientation, Identification, Exploitation and Resolution. The Peplau’s model provides the nurse as a facilitator of the process of the client development, where the professional - armed with the rules and techniques – interacts through relationship with the client to achieve a missed learning and maturing process.

"""I just read this article for the first time yesterday and I agree that the language in this article is not encyclopedic in tone. It made me laugh out loud in several places, and it's probably not supposed to. Even if the sources use this kind of language, it is not considered the best writing practices and can be vastly improved. For example,

 Why would Nelson's legitimate children be singled out in a box? Why in the section titled """"Children"""", would the ones sired out of wedlock not be included, as in the one he had with Georgeanne Crewe? Why actually have an entire section on his children? Why not just a paragraph? Or actually, they are mentioned in other places, so why the entire section to emphasize them? 
 Why is Kris Nelson described as """"making love"""" with Ron Reagan, but Nelson is described as """"cavorting"""" with two LA Rams cheerleaders in the same paragraph? These euphemisms need to be replaced by the simplest term: """"having sex"""".
 """"She was hell-bent on taking everything she possibly could and leaving Rick ruined."""" Good gracious, this needs a quote from a biographer or something: According to biographer John Q. Gossipmonger...
 I agree that too much is written about Nelson's volatile relationships. I don't see how it has any bearing on his career or notability in performing.
 Why is it necessary to know that Blair was a cocaine-user, shoplifter, and Nelson's family disapproved of their relationship? What bearing does this have on how readers should understand why he was notable? I'm not saying the details about his various affairs should be hidden, but the article makes it seem as if, perhaps like Hugh Hefner, Ricky Nelson was *as notable* for his affairs as he was the job that made him famous. Overlooking the article, the same amount of emphasis is placed on his music career as it is placed on his personal life. Actually, somewhat less. I get the impression a relative of Nelson's has had a hand in writing this article. Perhaps a progeny who was directly involved in some of the court cases among the Nelsons and Harmons. If, in fact, the best reliable sources assert that Nelson's affairs actually were as important as his performing career, a quote about that statement should come from a very good source. 

I wrote Roy Orbison's article, and I understand the issue above about sources writing about the """"juicy"""" parts of the subject's life. One of the biographies I used was rather determined to place undue and frankly odd emphasis on the writer's view that Orbison was a hapless underachiever who tripped into fame by accident, and the book is designed to paint him as a mediocre guy in extraordinary circumstances. Orbison's life was nowhere near as vibrantly sexual as Ricky Nelson's (an impression that is really backed up in this article), so the biographer slipped in shocking tidbits about other artists, for some reason explaining that only parts of Patsy Cline were found after her airplane accident. So what to do as a Wikipedia editor? Weed out that wtf? in the biography and stick only to the facts.

Dear C.Fred, this is ridiculous. I'm just conveying a fact, and Wikipedia is blocking me as soon as I do. I'm like the boy that states the fact that the emperor is naked, and you're among the public that tells him to be quiet. Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me? Anything that isn't right on the point? Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease. Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded. It is ridiculous, ridiculous... 

I thus contest being blocked for telling the truth. I argue that if telling the truth in itself is a reason for being blocked, then Wikipedia can certainly not be allocated to the category 'encyclopedia', since the definition of this concept surely must include telling the truth (to the best of its ability). If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the """"explanation"""" of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make """"heads and tails"""" of. If it belongs in an encyclopedia, then I'm Santa, Cladism is not science, but rather a reaction against science). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )""",0

Mentioning Darwin gave up natural selection and became a Lamarckian

The article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that Darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a Lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of The Origin of Species, which went into 6 different editions by 1872. Hence I propose the following insert at the first Darwin quotation in the current section ‘Publication of the theory of natural selection’, which I also propose should be retitled ‘Publication of the Darwin’s theory of evolution’.

Proposed insert:

'However,  even in the first edition of his book Darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection, but not the only one. In the last sentence of its Introduction he said “Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”

But by 1872 he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions, and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance Darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution, with its strong principle of inheritance, in favour of Lamarckian environmentalism, with a changing environment as the main selector. As C.D. Darlington wrote in 1950 in his Foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of The Origin:

""""Let no one imagine, however, that, in the world of science, Darwin's theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. On the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....The most abiding source of trouble was that discovered  by the Professor of Engineering at Edinburgh. Professor Fleming[sic] Jenkin pointed out in 1867, that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type, and its differences, as Darwin believed, blended in inheritance. Nature would never be able to keep any differences to select. 

Darwin's defence against this objection was already prepared. He had hinted it in the first edition of The Origin of Species: at the end of the Introduction he had said that """"Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."""" In later editions he hedged further. He fell  back on the other means. These depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment: its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. In adopting this view Darwin was giving up his own, and Wallace's, peculiar claim to originality: he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book: and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of Lamarck."""" 
[p. xvii On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection first edition reprint in The Thinker's Library by Watts & Co, 1950.] '

But Darlington failed to establish Lamarck's theory was discarded or disreputable. In fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid-20th century with the ‘Mendelian-Darwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. But even by 1950 Darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to Darlington:

""""In view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that Darwinism, in all civilised countries, would be taught as one of the foundations of thought, that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. That is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. But where, as in its applications to ourselves, in the study of the genetics of men, and to the histories of nations, as exact knowledge of the principles of variation, hybridization and selection is required, we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. At the same time the foundation of Darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in Darwin's own country. The Universities, with their museums and botanic gardens, are happy to forget what, in 1859, they were unable to resist. They contain no memorial of his work,  and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. The old pedantic learning of botany and zoology, which Darwin treated as one subject, they continue to cleave asunder, burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction."""" [‘’ibid’’ pxviii-xix]. '

I also propose the following edit of the article's introduction:

Admin input:
If you were in communication with an admin, and were actively working on it, you (or the admin) should have actually put a valid hangon message on the talk page. Quite frankly, I don't believe the draft article you're working on is ready to go for the following reasons: 
There's a number of grammar and spelling errors 
Headers should not have caps except for first letter, and should not be wikilinks 
Bolding is for the first use of the subject in the lead paragraph only 
References shouldn't be generalized like you've put them. Individual facts in the article should be footnoted to the references (see WP:FN and WP:CITET if you don't know how to do this) 
The section on """"Search engine submission software"""" should be omitted entirely, as it's covered in a separate article. Don't duplicate material, that's what wiki links are for 
Move the reasons why its notable (media coverage, awards) to the 1st or 2nd paragraph 
Please be aware that wikipedia is not a how-to guide, so instructional information about how to use the software is not appropriate. 
You can eliminate the """"further reading"""", as the book is in the refs (and get rid of the dummies graphic - it's not relevant to the particular program...it looks like you're plugging the book). AKRadeckiSpeaketh

Hey Kpjas
I really don't have time to go further and report these attacks, but I would just point out to you that: - those who I was dealing with these days -they are all remaints of one destructive and defeated force, they're the ones who glorify their fascisoid NDH and fascism and who salute 'heil Hitler' at the soccer stadiums. They, the cro-nationalists, are those same ones who ruined one respected and progressive country like Yugoslavia and never regreted it. Even today they openly attack everything connected with Yugoslavia, including the ever growing collaboration and new started unification process of the former yugoslav peoples. They are the same ones, who sent their terrorists to crash yugoslavian planes in 1970's and spread hatred and separatism between ex-Yugoslavians. And now, since all the world stood against them, they're playing their dirty game with the Serbocroatian language, finding some non-existing matters, with only to them known quazi-""""sources"""". People originating from South East Europe can easily recognize and stop them, something that wikipedia should probably do too. I am actually surprised how I didn't get any support from the administrators from Srbocroatian wikipedia, because whenever something like this happened before they would have cut the cro-nationalist's edits off in the next minute:)). I hope they will do it again, whenever they are aware of what's going on. Anyhow, I wish you all the best in your editing on wikipedia, if I have time in the future - I'll join it as an editor too, and at the end I want to repeat again:- please control the cro-nationalists on wikipedia as much as you can because they are nothing but distructive elements of a defeated nationalistic propaganda, and who behind the mask of 'good people' have always some 'hidden agenda' that they're working on, luckilly with no effect. Best Regards to you Krzsysztof and to Hexagon1; Cheers.""",0

More on guarnello
""""GUARNELLO (M/F). Both a kind of linen or cotton textile, and the feminine garment constructed from such a fabric.... The guarnello, rascia or saia is the standard form of dress for angels. It is worn by children as a simple, washable garment, and possibly also by pregnant women. There are also examples of guarnelli listed under items of male clothing."""" - Dress in Renaissance Italy, 1400-1500, by Jacqueline Herald, Humanities Press: NJ, 1981, quoted here

The coarse overdress for working women definition is from The World of Renaissance Florence by Francesco Adorno, Translated by W. Darwell, Giunti, 1999, ISBN 8809013492.
page 80

This site says:
A loose, sheer overdress (worn over a regular dress), was used at home and after birth - hence very few depictions of such garbs exist. Some has argued that it is not too unlike the sheer chemise like garbs Botticelli's """"Three graces"""" wears in his """"Primavera"""", but it can also be seen in his portrait of """"Smeralda Brandini"""" in London.

That may also be following Herald, which is listed as one of the sources.

The fabric is also translated as """"fustian"""" which would seem to be the coarser variety.

And here's the kicker: An article in the Globe and Mail (quoted with the crucial next line here) says
Mona Lisa had recently given birth to a baby, a team of Canadian and French scientists announced Tuesday, so her mysterious smile may have expressed the weary joy of a mother with a newborn. Using infrared technology that allowed them to see beneath a layer of varnish, the researchers found that Leonardo da Vinci's model had a gauzy layer over her dress they say was typically worn by pregnant women of the time, or mothers who had recently given birth. The filmy robe was called a guarnello.

Well, now I see why I missed your comment the first time...it wasn't even on my talkpage; I read it on someone else's talkpage (Broxton's) and got confused, haha.  But anyway, yeah.  To give a good example of a """"cup of coffee"""" MLS transaction, let me go back to Toronto's actions in the expansion draft of 2006.  In expansion drafts, clubs have the option to """"protect"""" a certain number of players while leaving others """"unprotected"""".  Unprotected players can be drafted at will by the expansion franchise (Toronto in this example), who can take one from each team.  One of the league's clubs, Real Salt Lake, made a strategic gamble that they could leave one of their key/totemic players, Jason Kreis (now their manager), unprotected.  They assumed that TFC would want nothing to do with an aging player whose oversized salary would be a big hit on their cap.  Seeing an opportunity, Mo Johnston at TFC took Kreis from RSL in the draft...not because he actually wanted Kreis, but because he knew that RSL still needed him.  By doing this, TFC was able to briefly hold Kreis hostage until RSL agreed to trade something else of value to get Kreis back.  So, Kreis was briefly a TFC player, but only because he became a pawn in larger machinations.  Because of instances like this, which are common enough throughout league history, we seem to have a consensus to disregard in-and-out situations during the offseason.
And for a bit of further detail — not relevant to Atieno and USL players but important as a point of reference for many other US-based players — it should be noted that MLS has a single-entity corporate structure, and that technically all players are contracted by the league itself, not by individual teams.  This means that all listings of player tenures with MLS teams are de facto in the first place, and that gives us a bit of leeway in striking out certain unimportant and very temporary tenures, as in the example given.  Hope that helps. ''' 《Defender of Open Editing》''' """,0

"""Well, I am not trying to pick a fight ) but I have NPOV issues with this article.  It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.

One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on """"the history of science"""" would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.

I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.

I am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution.   SR

""":Hi Labongo. Just to clarify a little, the criterion about self-identification as an indigenous people is actually one that is frequently and explicitly used by the major sources and bodies concerned with indigenous peoples' affairs and status. It was paraphrased a little for the article, but if you examine a few of the most-consulted definitions (such as UN, World Bank, ILO, etc) you will see that it's embedded in many of these formulations, with a deliberate intent. See for example the definitional quotes from these organisations, that used to be in the 'definitions' section of this article but now seems to have been split off into Definitions of the term Indigenous. As such, I think the criterion needs to remain mentioned along with the others that appear in the opening paras.

The statement """"Note that even if all the above criteria are fulfilled, some people may either not consider themselves as indigenous or may not be considered as indigenous by governments, organizations or scholars"""" does not quite mean the same thing. While that statement itself is fine as far as it goes, IMO it's not an adequate replacement. Self-identification and recognition is part of the """"set"""" of criteria that are often referred to in indigenous rights contexts.

I can see some rationale in the recent splitting out of the former content of the 'definitions' section into that separate article, however at the same time I think that this present indigenous peoples article does need to devote perhaps more space than we usually do to covering definitions and usage of terms/terminology. It's an area where there's a lot of general misconception and confusion between the common, adjectival and the formal, specific usage of words like indigenous, and even of the concept of indigenous peoples' rights and concerns (a lot of the discourse on this talkpg and others related are along these lines, for eg.) I think we could probably spare a few more paras to cover the most salient points and prominent definitions, so the detail's not all spliced away into a different article. Thoughts?  ʘ TALK

no content
an infobox can be  contentthe one on Keenan Davis  just needs rewriting in sentences. Please check WP:CSD for the actual criteria for speedy deletion. '''''' ( talk ) 

Generally, a biography should have content about biographical information on the subject (not just player stats). Statistical information, such as date and place of birth, information on historical significance (N/A here), pictures, and information on accomplishments is usually accepted as the content of a biography on Wikipedia. What we have here are some of Keenan Davis' NFL stats. The page should be written from his childhood/early years up to how he got into the NFL and what he did to get there (such as being in minor leagues), like any normal biography.

I understand your point on how infoboxes can be content, but in this situation what we have is a biography with just NFL stats. How can we consider that a biography?   

 A1/A3 tag for NBEO 

Hey, MrScorch, I just wanted to let you know that I declined your CSD nomination of the NBEO article.  You nominated it under A1 (no context) and A3 (no content), but the article isn't really that close to meeting either criterion; it's pretty clear what the subject of the article is, and it isn't actually empty.  If there are other reasons to delete it (there certainly may be), feel free to bring it up at AfD, but just having little content or no references isn't enough for CSD on its own. Thanks,  ⚇♔

 Requests for comment 

 RFC/discussion of article Global warming controversy 
Hello, . As a prominent contributor to Global warming controversy, you may want to be aware that a request for comments has been filed about it. The RFC can be found by the article's name in this list, and the actual discussion can be found on Talk:Global warming controversy, in case you wish to participate. Thank you for your contributions.      
Controversy or not
Reading the article about the existence of a """"controversy"""" seems that there is not any controversy at all and instead the few not supporting human-causation in rising temperatures are outliers.

If this is the case the article seems to be unnecessary entirely.  If it is not the case then the article's balance is not to Wikipedia's standards.

Dual philosophies used in enforcement of policies, guidelines and content.
Questions seem to persists relating to the validity of sources.  On one hand sources that are not in agreement with the """"global warming conseneus"""" viewpoint are removed with the related text.  On the other hand sources that are in agreement with the """"global warming consensus"""" viewpoint are replaced.

Questions persists relating to the Wikipedia standards for handling edits.
When edits are made that are about one side of the Global Warming Controversy they are deleted or reverted with little, if any explanation.  When edits are made about the other side of the Global Warming Controversy there are attempts to """"make them better"""" instead of deletions. """,0

"It should be noted that traditioning in most martial arts including Muay Thai(which mostly is not a martial art anymore due to the adoption of instinctive fighting techniques of the upper body(boxing as it is called)and many other martial art techniques not exclusive to Maui Boran or Maui Tha, etc...) women are not considered true martial artists anyway. That is because the arts are designed, used, mastered, and needed by men and its techniques are supposed to play to the strengths of a man. A woman's training dating back centuries was an emphasis on wounding the target with a basic attack and running. This is one of the many reasons escorts where provided. It is sad what has happened to Karate and TKD in the modern schools on average in the emphasis on sport and money from children practioners(by way of parent(s), unconditioned elders, and women.

 How many of the claims will turn out to be untrue? 

It has been said that over 200 people have come forward to make accusations against Savile since this story broke, but the figure of 200 will obviously be on the light side as some victims would have either passed away or not be willing to come forward at this juncture. I find it rather hard to understand why at least some of these victims did not come forward to make accusations whilst he was alive - it has been reported that the odd person got the odd complaint years ago but not to the extent that have popped up recently. If just 10% came forward, that would mean at least 20 complaints, and that figure would not have been secret a for long once the press got hold of the story. I do not profess to understand the workings of the abuser or those that have been abused but it does beg the question - did Savile have such power over his victims that they were so terrified to come forward or are some of the now presented cases just a case of get what you can while you can in this time of recession? It seems that this guy will turn out to be the """"Harold Shipman"""" of the sex abuse world, which says a lot more about the people that allowed him to get away with it than it does about Savile himself.

I can only conclude that most of the editors here are schoolboys who have done the basic circular motion theory and are totally unwilling to examine the general cases of curved path motion such as ellipses and hyperbolae and the role of the radially outward centrifugal force.

I would say that my section was erased yesterday for no other reason than that nobody here could understand it since they have never done planetary orbital theory in advanced applied maths at university.

There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer.

Firtsly I want to make it clear there was no real proof at all, the """"proof"""" provided were: a comparison of Ahmadinejad's 2005 first round results per province (in which 7 major candidates competed and none had a majority) with his 2009 results per province, which ofcourse showed and increase for Ahmadinejad votes everywhere and than the claim that this should be impossible, which """"proves"""" Mousavi won. A claim by Mousavi office that the """"actual results"""" leaked and showed him with 19 milion votes and Ahmadinejad with only 5 milion votes which contradicts the green movement's claims that the eelection results weren't counted at all, because the results were in (supposedly) much to quickly, which is their other """"major proof"""" that the results were rigged. Another """"proof"""" is the myth of """"all Azeris would automaticly vote for Mousavi, disregaring all politics and voting purely on ethnic basis"""" (which should """"prove"""" that the election was rigged as Ahmadinejad won in Tabriz), but at the same time the Persians are not gonna vote ethnicly for some reason unknown to us, infact they were all gonna vote for Mousavi the non-Persian. Other than these flawed theories presented by the Green movement you've got a few claims by them that anonymous government workers have admitted the election was rigged, the problem being that none of this can ever ben confirmed and the assumption that the fact that 100,000 people demonstrated in a city of 14,000,000 (metropolian area) - although nowhere else in the country the Greens could get over 1000 people - should make everyone believe that it is sooo obviously clear tha a vast majority of Iran's 74 milion people support this man. And all of these weak claims are mentioned throughout all articles related (and even articles hardly related) to the elections and/or green movement. Now if this is the only """"proof"""" they have (which it is), why would pro-American governments and the media in their country's take it all so seriously? Simple, politics are politics. There has been a smear-campaign against Ahmadinejad, in western media ever since he got in power and against Iran ever since the revolution, because the Iranian politics do not coincide with American geo-strategic interests. Why do you think their camera crews prior to the elections only interviewed university students in Northern Tehran which spoke fluent English, while no other city, region or population group's views were ever shown on American news? Because they wanted to create an image that Mousavi is more populair, while infact he wasn't, as the fully legitimate results show.

Konitski: 
According to the 1804 Code Napoléon in vigor at the time of Chopin's birth, Chopin was born a Frenchman - now, whether you want to interpret this as a French national or a French citizen, as far as I am concerned, c'est du pareil au même: he was a Frenchman.
Chopin began travelling outside of Poland - or should we say the Duchy of Warsaw? - in 1828: Berlin; 1829, Vienna, Prague, Dresden; 1830: Dresden, Prague, Vienna; 1831: Vienna, Stuttgart, Paris. In order to travel, he needed a passport and I assume (forgive me Widipedia for assuming) that he travelled on a Polish or Duchy of Warsaw passport.  No, I have no facsimile of it, nor have I ever seen any, but without passport, Chopin could not have left Poland. 
NOTE: In Selected Correspondence of Fryderik Chopin, collected & annotated by Bornislaw Edward Sydow, translated from Polish and other languages Chopin was using in his correspondence, by Arthur Hedley, McGraw-Hill, 1963, p. 90, from what is referred to as Chopin's Album:

It has seemed like that for a while. You disagree with a majority of people, and it's getting a bit disruptive in my view. Don't claim ownership on the article JAF, others are free to edit it. Your opinion doesn't control it.

Anyone have any thoughts on the addition of Bernard Lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians?  Since Augustine, Aquinas are listed and Lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of Catholic philosophers, I thought he would be a good addition to the list. His work is well-regarded in 20th century philosophy, he certainly has the credentials, and I think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory, epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the """"data of consciousness"""" and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see Insight: A study of Human Understanding. There are Lonergan Centers at Boston College, University of Toronto, Seton Hall, and Loyola Marymount University devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology.

"Introduction & the article 

Hi new poster here, ive been following the article for a few weeks, I have reviewed the external links good and bad and have a few ideas.  The controversy that surrounds this organization seems to be based between nichiren shoshu(in japan) and sgi(international) with alot of the groundwork coming from japan where the organizations originated from.  After looking around and comparing to the other religions and sects, i propose we seperate the criticisms from each article and make a new article that, most likely, will be a cite war.  
  The benefit is two-fold.  First, the articles relating to each sect of buddhism talk about THAT buddhism, what they do, where they came from, etc etc, and not talk about the criticisms that anyone may have about them(similar to the anti-christianity criticism article and others).  This is the most NPOV solution i can up with.  Also, having a criticisms oriented paragraph in the intoduction seems extremely bias against an organization that promotes culture and peace(i have seen some demonstrations, nothing on a global scale or read about the political party, has anyone btw?)  Secondly, in the split article section, the details can come out a little more clearly as they arent presented on the article talking about a buddhist sect, its an article about how the sect is impacting the world.  It just seems a bit more accurate.  
  Hopefully i will have a viable solution setup after i do some more reading about editing etc... Thoughts?",0

 How about...( Warning: I'm Irish)

How about you people desist from telling us, the Irish people, that we are mere Brits who haven't discovered this yet ( as so many of you have already argued here).

"""Hi Paul

Given your previous edits of this article I'm wary of your neutrality here, but here's what I think about this

The 'controversy' section actually has several subsections.   Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called """"a controversial person"""" and was much different than its current incarnation.

The Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.

The references to """"Oh Paula"""" probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.

I'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section are
- Coulter wanting to """"bring down the president"""", no matter the best interests of her client/advisee 
- Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissed
- Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her """"trailer trash"""")

Additionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I'm sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn't give Coulter nearly enough credit.

Though it doesn't matter for this section, you might see that the """"trailer-park trash"""" comment.   It is not satire or sarcasm to achieve comic effect, it is an honest to goodness insult.

 """"mass movement of Turks into central Anatolia"""" is an unsourced statement from a Wiki article, so I am not sure if it's worth discussing (the article I cited above disputes that). If there was a massive wave of newcomers there should be genetic evidence.

I don't think """"critical mass"""" is a meaningful concept here. As Don Ringe put it: """"History shows that comparatively small groups of immigrants can induce their new neighbors to adopt their language — gradually over several generations, of course — if (1) they have enough economic or political power, and (2) they can offer some important advantage to those who are willing to adopt their language.""""

Pardon me if I make a mistake here (I haven't had breakfast and I'm about to go out).

The reference only provides one example: """"accepted to college"""". As far as I've read, the false ideas of usage usually pertain to expressions that have not been in the standard language for long, but in a dialect form for longer. Sometimes even a usage might die out and then be revived again, to be defended on its age. Would not it not be clearer to elaborate on """"linguistic matters""""?

 List of prophets in intro 

Hey all.  The list of prophets was fleshed out to the closer to full list of known, accepted prophets.  I knwo this list has been kept short by agreement way back, so i'm putting this topic here to allow people to discuss which prophets should be listed, if any, and how many.  I believe there's a more comprehensive list elsewhere in the Baha'i articles which mention Hud, the prophet to the Sabeans, Noah, etc. all prophets that would have to go into a full list of """"prophets accepted by Baha'is"""".  I think it's all two long.  

My own view is that Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad make sense, because these are central prophets to religions that are typically seen as """"Abrahamic"""" religions.  Buddha is added (I suspect) to clarify that the religion is not outside of connection to Dharmic traditions either.  Obviously a full treatment of prophets, the nature thereof, and the relationships between them would be inappropriate in the lead paragraph.  Anybody have a bright idea for better summarization of the point without toasting off the lead paragraph as unreadable?  """,0

The initial criticism was that Stringer should be added as a source. It appears nobody follows this Talk page who has the expertise in anthropology (nor even the common sense) to comprehend that Stringer is an expert source who should be added to this article and it is now a badly-outdated article, as no valid challenges have been brought forth that would exclude Stringer's opinion from Wikipedia articles (and despite the very long period given to Wikipedians to challenge it), and thus:

I concur that this article should be unlocked, because, for example, see also my request for another year-old source to be updated, which is crucial as it is in the lede, and claiming that the RAO hypothesis is still the mainstream hypothesis in human evolution, when even those anthropologists who are cited as calling it the """"mainstream"""" hypothesis have retracted that claim and you are therefore basically misinforming a new generation of K-12 students, year-by-year, as you've kept this page outdated since 2010. It is obvious that no Wikipedians with expertise in anthropology have editing-rights to this locked article and are being responsible enough to maintain this article since approximately 2010, not even responsible enough to add simple {update} and {POV dispute} types of tags.

So, who locked this article? And why is it still locked for years when the person who locked it doesn't have either the due diligence and care, or else the expertise in anthropology, to maintain the page as being up-to-date within even three years, yet they took the responsibility for locking it and no """"elder Wikipedians"""" have addressed the issue?

 Waterfalls 
Hamilton looks like an impressive place for waterfalls.  I""""ll certainly have to include it in my list of places to visit.  I can't speak for any of the areas in the Pacific Northwest (which is home to hundreds of high, impressive falls), in North Carolina, according to Kevin Adams' """"North Carolina Waterfalls: A Hiking and Photography Guide"""", our state is estimated to have around 1,000 - 1,500 falls in the state, most of them in Transylvania County, NC (aka """"The Land of Waterfalls"""").  Estimates are that TC contains between 400-500 """"major"""" waterfalls in an area slightly smaller than the City of Hamilton (390 sq mi versus Hamilton's 439 sq mi).  As for what you call """"major"""" - that's pretty much up to the viewer.  One man's gushing torrent is another man's damp spot on the side of a rock.  In TC, a major waterfall is usually considered at least 15-20' high - not including talus - or having enough current to be an obvious waterfall (such as Hooker Falls).

If you ever get the chance to visit NC, please do.  We've got a lot of beautiful, rugged country.  To this day, I get reports about new waterfalls discovered by people who are just now able to scamper through some of the roughest terrain the east coast has to offer.    

Part of the problem with defining the """"City with the most waterfalls"""" is that neither term is overly well defined.  """"City"""" can mean """"town limits"""" or """"Metropolitan Area"""" or any other of a dozen different definitions.  Then you have the problem with the exact definition of a waterfall.  Ergo, you have the problem.

"Technically you still can't distinguish acceleration from gravity - they are, in fact, one in the same. The simple direction difference between the negative and positive masses accelerations are not qualifiers for discrimination. There is no way, in a single reference frame, to distinguish the negative and positive masses - i.e. whether the earth is negative or positive mass and the object in question  is positive or negative. Further, the magnitude of the acceleration should be identical for each object.

I would suggest reading up on Hawking's idea (in his universe in a nutshell book) that mass energy + gravitational energy = 0. In essence, you can create all the matter you want, as long as it has gravitational pull which he regards as a negative energy. If this is the case, then there could, in fact, be negative mass with positive gravitational energy, which behaves in an opposite manner. I would presume that annihilation due to matter-antimatter interactions would have gravitational energy considerations as well - but in any case, the mere fact that negative mass would accelerate in a different direction in a gravitational field does not in itself preclude its existence, especially since gravitational laws were formulated without accounting for this eventuality.",0

Please reverse this merger. The simplest and most important reason is that aside from it's function as a thyroid hormone thyroxine is simply a chemical compound that should have its own article. For instance, go look at the triiodothyronine page and you'll see the standard chemical description page there with molecular weight, chemical formula, IUPAC name, etc. - a wealth of information uninteresting to and therefore absent from the thyroid hormone page this link now redirects to. The original thyroxine page should be restored with all of this chemical information. Regarding some of the above discussion - it is true that thyroxine produced in the thyroid can be either enantiomer and that the isolated levo-thyroxine enantiomer is what is in the drug. This is specifically interesting because levothyroxine can only be converted to """"normal"""" T3, not """"reverse"""" T3 - which is the other enantiomer. This has physiological consequences for those on the drug. So I think this is good information that we should add to the Thyroxine page once it is restored - but I don't think a separate page is needed for that. We just need the separate Thyroxine page back to have a place for that information to go - along with all of the now absent chemical information since merger with the Thyroid Hormones article.

Fine, but keep in mind that this is not solely a matter of being NPOV- this is also a matter of accuracy.  The Eastern Catholic Churches that are in communion with the Vatican are not properly referred to by the term """"Roman Catholic Chruch""""- only those who practice the Latin or Western Rite are.  Take a look at this FAQ on Eastern Catholiscim to see how the term is properly used: .  The only truely accurate way to refer to the church headed by the Vatican is the Catholic Church, and if referring to this church with this title is NPOV, then there is no way that this article can be NPOV and use these terms as accurate as possible.
I was aware that """"Catholic"""" also means universal and is a Mark of the Church- I have to admit that I was not aware that other sects of Christianity use the word """"Catholic"""" in their names.

What you forget is that fallacy is the domain of those few and far between who have such conditioning as to be immune to the bandwagon effect, and who look for any way possible to get through to people that their reasoning is irrational.  The instant they succeed, they are joined by people who lack that same conditioning and eventually forget the original meaning.  The people you reference are no philosophers or logicians, for there can be no name for what that is supposed to represent that will persist through the ages unless it references the aforementioned conditioning.  But specifically regarding what this so called """"logician"""" claims, he wishes that people can influence a debate without putting forth any argument at all.

Jimmy was not released from prison he was on work release he skipped out on work release and then came to Miami to work after Hurricane Andrew.  I met him after that when he came to the Tampa Clearwater area.  I was a prostitute when I met him.  He picked me up I believe to kill me.  I was so causious that I think that he was amused by me.  Then when I told him that I was sick of the life and wanted to get clean, he said I could stay with him.  I got clean on his living room floor where I was sick for several weeks.  

I can tell you many thing that were never told or written about.  I was there.  I know how these women died, what they say in his eyes before their last breath as he chocked me on the day of the OJ vertic.

 Germany -  four entries 

You did not respond to my argument at all - please read it more carefully:

The IOC cannot be seen as the single authoritative source on this article, as the IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes only unofficial tables per single Games. Therefore this article is in violation with WP:No original research! The official source for the German National Olympic Committee (DOSB) does list the Olympic Medals for Germany from 1896 to 2012 → .

There were no official country codes before 1976: Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of each Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.

At the Games of 1956, 1960, and 1964 the German team was simply known as """"Germany"""" and the usual country code of (GER) was used. Yet, the IOC code EUA is currently applied in hindsight in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given. 

Yugoslavia does not exist anymore as a country - the FRG does. The (FRG) Federal Republic of Germany did not cease to exist. It was a simple code change, same country, same NOC. NO alternate NOCs: EUA, FRG and GER have always had the same German National Olympic Committee (NOC) recognized in 1895, same NOC President (Willi Daume, 1960–1993), same Olympic Committee located in Frankfurt - only the codes have changed. Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). """"West Germany"""" did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG. The """"enlarged"""" Federal Republic of Germany (known simply as """"Germany"""") is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany - the very same country, with the same National Olympic Committee since 1895.

"Important clarification to add: Processor vs Core Microsoft definitions 

Page shall contain the exact definition of what a processor is, microsoftly speaking. Indeed, this concept is quite blur if we refer to the numerous pages from different Microsoft web sites.

For instance, at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsserver/evaluate/features/compare.mspx, we can find:
Windows 2003 Server Standard x64 R2 (64 bits):
- 4-way symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support

Other example for the same Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition at http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/64bit/x64/standard.mspx
- memory-bound applications that do not require more than four processors.
- supports up to 32 GB of RAM on 1- to 4-way servers.
- Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition supports up to four CPUs on one server)

If we refer to Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing, multiprocessor architecture or multicore processor are both SMP architecture. Thus, by speaking sometimes about 4 processors support, sometimes about 4-way SMP support, Microsoft confuses us all.
Coming to a Quadri 4-cores based server (16 SMP), this leads to go from a Standard edition (4 processors support) to a DataCenter edition (4x4=16 SMP support), thus raising the license price as for no less than +700%.",0

"""

You know that the name change is not at all the whole point here. The problems here such as heavily relying on Chinese sources, inaccuracy in historical facts, copying government propaganda, are commonplace not only in this particular article but most all topics on nations colonized under China. And further, if the current situation continues on Wikipedia, you cannot guarentee the so called NPOV. Not only that will be a joke, the whole Wikipedia thing will end up being another hypocratic, """"civilization"""" game. The biggest issue here is the mentality behind the creation of these articles and problems here, hence the debate and this is just the beginning. You have to realize that the overwhelming articles on China-occupied regions on Wikipedia are full of POV but not NPOV. So don't keep fulling yourselves. It's time to wake up now.

Those who're currently in advantageous positions here, are so not because they're intelectually and morally strong but just because their numbers are bigger. They are basically consisted of two types: One types are those Chinese who're either been brainwashed and/or are chauvinistic fanatics. And the other types are Americans who (naturally) have so little knowledge about the world outside of northern America. But then they would have hard time admitting that and therefore, they will end up either pretending as they know or they would simply echo the Chinese POV which is largely circulated and readily available. For them, the famous saying, which goes like if you repeat a lie a thousand times it would become the truth, will make perfect sense. That """"truth"""", or what you guys are shouting here as """"the common"""" names and stuff, is exactly what is blocking not only your eyesights but as well your human consciousness.

One big difference between the two types though are that the Chinese here do know what they are doing because they have their agenda and they're intentional. But the Americans are just naive and are being used.

 OK, so here's the thing... 
A bunch of trolls got upset because someone added a cartoon reference to the wood article and well this is a wood article """"not a cartoon article"""".  That's mildly valid.  Well, it's not a sculpture article either, yet there's a sculpture on the first paragraph.  That's allowed because wood is used in the sculpture.  Well, wood is used in that comic now and that's every bit as real.  The only difference is some boring person came upon the duck sculpture by accident, and the XKCD reference brought itself into relevance on its own.  If anything this makes the XKCD reference more relevant, not less than a sculpture of two birds.  The only difference is that you're jealous you didn't think of it yourself first.  Reality is reality because it is real not because it stays in a Wikipedia article without being censored.  XKCD is real.  Wikipedia generates content, but how narcissistic would one have to be to think Wikipedia is the only place that can.  Wikipedia exists to accurately document the world.  XKCD is a part of that, certainly more important and interesting than wood.  XKCD is popular culture, and anything less than an acknowledgment of that would be a direct offense to it's author, Randal Munroe, and his truly inspiring gift to this Earth.  You should think first before brushing off something so grand.  If wood wasn't in popular culture yet, is sure as heck is now, and you have the Wiki-censors to thank for that.""",0

 Advice 

Hallo, I see you've added several articles to Wikipedia about Lifestyle brands etc.  A few points:
Please learn how to add Categories - see the changes I've made to your articles
Please check where your links are going: I've fixed a link to Patagonia which was intended for Patagonia (clothing), but you've got links to disambiguation pages in your Icon brand article.
Please do not add blog sites as External links - see WP:ELNO
You can make a link to Icon brand from the words """"Icon brands"""" by adding an """"s"""" at the end of the link: [[Icon brand]]s. Much neater than repeating the whole thing in a piped link.
The See Also section should not include articles which are already linked within the article.
Please don't use informal language like """"it's"""" for """"it is"""": this is an encyclopedia. (It's quite OK on talk pages).
There is a lot to learn about editing Wikipedia, but it is an interesting journey. Happy Editing. D """,0

 Process definitions 

As a Wikipedia user with no specific knowledge of comic collecting, I find the Process table confusing. It is stated that CGC grades material from 0.5 to 10, then Definitions defines what A, P, S, M and E denote, but below that is given an example grading """"VF/NM 9.0"""". I'm going to induce that NM is near mint, but am I to guess what VF is or why it is there? 121.45.247.24  

Good point. The numbers correspond to more traditional descriptive grades such as """"fine"""", """"very fine"""", """"near mint"""", and """"mint"""". I've added a sentence explaining that and a link to the chart on their website. Also, I removed the """"VF/NM"""" part from the example. Does that make it more comprehensible?   

 Missing an obvious and major criticism 

One of the most obvious criticisms is that the CGC practice is the ultimate objectification and de-artification of the comic/magazine being graded, because it is sealed permanently and will never be read/viewed again except for the cover. All of the story and interior art are essentially lost forever for all intents and purposes.  One might as well just encase it in Lucite like a bug in amber. — ''''''   Talk⇒ ʕ(Õلō)ˀ  Contribs. """,0

 Racism, Noble savage, Orientalism and Araby 

No flaming intended, I just want balance to come to this subject.  Explain to the world, how putting Greek homosexuals on a pedestal, is in any way, shape, or form, NPOV.  You know, Greek scholars on the matter paint homosexuality in a different hue than outsiders who romanticize the subject (e.g. Oliver Stone's Alexander (film)).  They see homosexuality as existing all over the world and in all eras.  To portray Ancient Greece as some buggery paradise is prejudiced and ignorant, just as if they were all claimed to be paragons of heterosexual machismo.  Gay Greeks are your Wandering Jew.  Whenever I watched Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, homosexuality did not come to mind.

You can't always have it to your fantasy or ideal, simply by calling other people """"narrow"""".  So far, you've succeeded in stereotyping Greeks as rabid homosexuals.

This is an excellent article and a valid subject and deleting it is an absurd idea.

2) See the award-winning documentary: """"Brats: Our Journey Home"""" by Dona Musil (it won 19 awards).

4) See the Oscar Nominated movie """"The Great Santini"""" based on the book by the same name by Pat Conroy.

I'm only answering this because I'm really bored, excruciatingly so, and I also find it kind of amusing. People writing and, or, approving of psychologically harmful disinformation, that starving girls read, including the expressed desire to include a potentially triggering image of such a starving girl, illicits no response whatsoever. A collapsible box however, seems to be somehow construed as a threat to  civilization. One inane comment after another becomes somewhat irritating. 
Despite only having a ninth grade education, I actually did learn how to read. I also learned the proper use of Latin phrases, e.g.; id est (i.e) and exempli gratia (e.g.). For example, or to use an abbreviation of a Latin phrase, e.g.; ...in article text, i.e., how they were recently used here. Should have been e.g., not, i.e.. That being said, I read this:  
MOS:COLLAPSE:Scrolling lists and boxes that toggle text display between hide and show are acceptable for use, but should not be used in article prose.  This includes reference lists, image galleries, and image captions; Collapsible sections are useful in ,infoboxes, or to consolidate information already covered in prose.

This is not prose:
Candidate genes include dopamine transporter, dopamine receptors D2/D3,[46] dopamine beta-hydroxylase monoamine oxidase A, catecholamine-methyl transferase, serotonin transporter promoter (SLC6A4), 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2A), 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B receptor (5-HT1B),[47] the 10-repeat allele of the DAT1 gene,[48] the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene,[48] and the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene (DBH TaqI).[49]

Your alleged concern over compliance with WP:ACCESS is unwarranted and seems to be self serving. It says nothing about """"Collapsible boxes"""".

Some just learn to bite the bullet, wear the bullshit, adapt to suppressing the 'Ah, you fucken dopey arsehole' sort of thought that passes one's article-parsing mind from hour to hour, and write instead, 'you're mistaken' or even 'you screwed up'. Of course there are lots of ignoramuses and liars here, like everywhere in the world and in every sphere of activity. Here, the rule is, if you want to lie or push a POV against the evidence, as long as you stick to the AGF rules, you can enjoy longevity while enjoying exhibitions of suicide by people who call you out. That looks outrageous, at first glance, but without it, tens of thousands of quite good quality articles on difficult and controversial topics would never have been written. Anthropologists, when studying a tribe in field research, understand that they must adapt, provisorily, to the rules of the tribe: back in their professorial armchair, a different discourse obtains which, were it thrown the tribe's way would (a) only be offensive (b) obstruct the acquisition of a tribe's ethnography and (c) ultimately, be detrimental to the tribe itself, which down the line may well need that expert's return to assist it in adapting in turn to a larger world outside of its own mental confines.

 I have a 1949 edition of the GE """"Manual of Electric Instruments: Construction and Operating Principles"""" which describes a 4-quadrant power factor meter of the polarized vane type - it works like a miniature synchronous motor, with a polyphase rotating field like a motor, energized with the phase voltages, and the rotor magnetized by one selected phase current; the angle of the rotor directly represents the angle between voltage and current. The book describes, but sadly doesn't give a picture of, a 360 degree 4-quadrant scale, said to be useful for tie lines where the source and load ends can interchange.

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. 

III. 

It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for thirty days, effective thirty days after the issuance of this opinion. It is further ordered that, prior to seeking reinstatement a",0

 Been a while. 

Happy belated: birthday, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and Groundhog Day.

Take a break from all the WP nannying. Hope you're doing great @ MIT.

Take another look at December 2008’s and last month’s archived portal pages and see if they work correctly on your end. Shades of Extreme Home Makeover - etc.

This may be the closest I get to re-mastering old films, like they now have to do for Blu-Ray. Feels like it, fun but tedious.

Some of these archived portal pages I've trundled through going back to Jan of '08 (so far) succumb to table-formatting bugs (on my platform [Tiger/Safari (+FF3)]). So I kludged the position of the calendars. But these two months work fine. No clue as to why they break. Is there a documented bug? This seems to be some kind of CSS error.

The Portal:Current events/How to archive the portal page must not be visited very often of late, so I'm attempting to make its link more prominent by adding a comment above the """"fold"""". Don't have a clue how many editors might contribute to the upkeep of this, though.

Here are handy linx for you to peruse these pages, only the last 2 have reconstructed sidebars As Of This Writing (hereinafter """"AOTW""""):

January 2008 (works okay on my plat)

February 2008 (broken, so it's kludged)

March 2008 (okay)

April 2008 (okay)

May 2008 (works okay, International hols are an embarrassment [why just May?])

June 2008 (works OK)

July 2008 (breaks with prescribed table formatting, so it's kludged)

August 2008 (OK)

September 2008 (OK)

October 2008 (OK)

November 2008 (also breaks so it's kludged. Don't know what'll happen if we attempt to reconstruct & restore a local [temporally speaking ;)] sidebar)

December 2008 (Okay and complete, with the important comment that it's an archived section)

January 2009 (Also OK, as above)

So pass the word along that some spadework has been done, and it's as self-explanatory as I can manage to make it. Thanx again for all the great work on this design, unjustly neglected.

Now to wake up our 2.5-year-old. Yes, it's been a while.

""":It's not a question of whether the fact should be included. It's a question of the emphasis being put on them.  Changing the section name doesn't fix the problem, unless you want to head it """"A random list of matches that implies nothing"""".  The difficulty is that someone has picked these matches out as having particular significance.  And in so doing they are voicing an opinion that they are significant, without any cite that says """"this was one of Sharapova's must notable matches"""".  And that's even before we consider the match analysis that goes along with it.

To give an extreme example to illustrate; what would you say if I was to create a section called """"Maria's Greatest Moment"""" and write about my favourite Sharapova match winning forehand smash (with a cite to a mention of the match).  All factual, but with an emphasis that is entirely my POV.  And even if we all agreed that, yes indeed, this was her greatest moment, it still would be entirely POV unsupported by reputable sources.  This """"Notable matches"""" is obviously not as blatant, but it's the same thing.

The only way to remove opinion from the picture is to establish a factual measure for a match's inclusion, and I don't think that's something that can be established as a precedence on one tennis article alone.  I'm not saying its a big problem.  But anyone assessing the quality of the article is likely to ask """"Whose opinion is it that these matches are so notable/significant/special/whatever that they deserve a special mention in a separate section?""""

Gibraltar self-government

Dear Justin, I can't understand why you delete my edits on the Gibraltar article and then post the following comment in my page: """"You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war according to the reverts you have made on Gibraltar."""" I have not intended to start an edit war, just eliminated a reference that seems controversial and was not supported by any reference (1) and repositioned some uncontroverted facts (2):

1) The article began with the expression """"Gibraltar (...) is a self-governing British overseas territory (...)"""". This was not supported by any objective reference in the article and, in fact, it is something not endorsed by the UN (see below), which at least provides some ground for not accepting the self-government of Gibraltar as a self-evident fact. Therefore, I substituted it for some referenced facts.

2) The article referenced the fact that Gibraltar is on the UN's non self-governing territories list but British and Gibraltarian polititians think that it should be removed. Only it was lost somewhere in the middle of this (long) article. I repositioned this information to the introduction of the article where it summarises the territory's political nature. It does not matter if 50 years ago it was the UK who nominated Gibraltar for the list: this status is reviewed every year and has not yet been reverted by UN's Special Committee.

What surprises me is: I would have expected that if you disagree with my edits, you would discuss them or, if you think they do not offer a holistic view, you complete them with additional referenced facts. Instead of that, you just deleted the edits and accused me of edit warring.

I will appreciate your discussing the changes and contributing with additional insight and referenced facts. Please do not merely undo my edits.

Kind regards.  

If you want to discuss this the appropriate place is the talk page of the article, not here as this is not a matter between you and justin.  The reality is that since the 2006 constitution Gibraltar is manifestly self governing, sadly progress on delisting it by the UN C24 is hampered by Spain's foolish attitude and intransigence.  It is amusing that that committee is comprised of representatives of states with less democracy than Gibraltar and if you follow the proceedings they have been singularly useless in achieving anything in relation to their remit on ANY territory such that the GoG declined to attend further meetings.  In relation to the politics of Gibralar, which is what the article is about, the UN is irrelevent - indeed the committee has not even visited the territory in question despite being invited to do so by the GoG and the UK. They are not so much a paper tiger as a limp piece of used bog roll.   

Please do not insult my intelligence that your intentions were anything other than to push a POV with that edit.  The facts remain that Gibraltar is self-governing.  It is only Spain that for its own political agenda denies this and the UN C24 is discussed in the article.  Your POV edit sought to give those facts WP:UNDUE prominence.  Your behaviour was also to edit war to keep that edit, hence my warning was appropriate.  And as Gibnews points out the correct place for that discussion was the article talk page. '''' talk """,0

 Hi Duxwing,
 Sorry for the very long response time.  The sentence """"a Y such that Z exists for X"""" is much harder to decipher than the other version and because of the nontraditional order of quantifiers; in some cases it may have different meaning as a mathematical statement.  (It is also not noticably more concise.)  For example, the sentence """"An element −v ∈ V for every v ∈ V exists"""" is impossible to parse because of the strange quantifier placement.  I suggest that if you are not familiar enough with higher mathematics to understand the importance of precision in quantifier choice and order then you should tread very carefully when editing technical phrases.  (Some of the other edits you made were unobjectionable or improvements, but they were all mixed in together and I didn't want to risk leaving an incorrect technical phrase.)

  Emphasis added, translations by google.
It's not clear to me how you get from that to your claim of """"ethics did indeed form the motive for criticism of Quinn"""".  The author of the article has gone well out of his way to state the exact opposite is the case.  (Just in case you're not familiar with the idiom, excuse in this context is the reason given to mask the real reason, which the author details in the preceding paragraph.)  I'm more disturbed by the fact that you think finding a single source is sufficient for getting a WP:FRINGE viewpoint into the article.  
You may be able to dig up a journalist who does think that ethical considerations motivated the behavior.  That shows you found a journalist who had an off day; it happens sometimes.  Given the amount of coverage we have to select from, I'd be expecting to see a half-dozen pieces expressing that viewpoint for it to be considered a legitimate minority view.  Despite lots of motivated, net-savvy folks looking for those pieces, they're still nowhere to be found.  This gives me high confidence that, for the population of adults who write for a living, the idea that ethics motivated GG is simply not worth writing about (probably because it's not remotely plausible, but I don't have to reach that conclusion here).

The vote was on the Campbell Case but the primary reason was the Russian Treaties:

""""Baldwin was careful to emphasise that the Treaties were the substance of his objections. Standfordham wrote to the King, on 7 October, 'I saw Mr Baldwin who, in reply to my question """"Do you want to turn the Government out?"""" said """"Yes, but not on the Campbell issue, but on the Russian Treaties which the country generally condemns."""" He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall. ...' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

Wasn't there, in an earlier version of this article a statement that Al Sharpton-when a youth-was first introduced to street politics and organizing by THE REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT (RYM)?  As I recalled, the RYM was an arm of the U.S. Labor Party headed by Lyndon Larouche.  Interesting that Larouche who years ago was involved in NYC politics through his proxy cnadidates running for local office right into the 80s never mentioned Sharpton, or his affiliation with RYM.
It is also curious how the media, even African American journalists failed to mention that the original arbitors of the forced eviction efforts of Freddies was its landords, a black Pentacostal Church!!!???  Nothing of this was ever mentioned by the press.  And Sharpton never gave a clue to the public. Amazing.  So, it is true the allegations of Sharpton being and agent provocateur.  There are more inconsistancies, like his perfidy of the United African Movement and betrayal of Alton Maddox.  Now, Rev. Al is cozy with Obama and the New York County District Attorney's office?

"""Haplogroup L lineages are relatively infrequent(less than 1%) throughout Europe with the exception of Iberia, where frequencies as high as 11.7% percent have been reported. These lineages had previously been associated with the African slave trade. However an analysis by Gonzalez et al revealed that most of the L lineages matched Northwest African L lineages rather than contemporary Sub-Saharan L lineages. The authors suggest this pattern indicates that most of the Sub-Saharan L lineages entered Iberia in prehistoric times rather than in more recent periods. 

Haplogroup L lineages are present at low frequencies in Eastern Europe. Though a high diversity of African mtDNA lineages have been detected, few lineages have accumulated enough mutations in Europe to form monophyletic clusters. Malyarchuk et al 2005 detected only two monophyletic clusters, L1b and L3b, in Russians with an estimated age no greater than 6,500 years. Malyarchuk et al 2008 identified African L1b, L2a, L3b, L3d and M1 clades in slavic populations at low frequencies. L1b, L3b and L3d had matches with West African populations, indicating that these lineages probably entered Europe through Iberia. One lineage L2a1a, appeared to be much older, indicating that it may have entered Europe in prehistoric times. This clade was possibly related to L2a1 clades identified in 10 individuals of Ashkenazi heritage from France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Russia. L2a lineages are widespread throughout Africa, as a result, the exact origins of this lineage are uncertain.

Ormewood is correct that later revisions by someone (to put all wind considerations into one section) caused a loss of continuity. I was the original author of the section """"Shape of The Tower"""" in March of 2007, so I know that the orphaned sentences answer the question: What mathmatical calculation was Eiffel referring to? I tried to edit the article, but found it is now semi-protected owing to excessive vandalism. I propose that an autoconfirmed user revise the entire paragraph as follows:
In search of what mathmatical calculation Eiffel referred to, researchers have found that Eiffel used empirical and graphical methods accounting for the effects of wind rather than a specific mathmatical formula. Careful examination of the tower shows a basically exponential shape; actually two different exponentials, the lower section overdesigned to ensure resistance to wind forces. Several mathmatical explanations have been proposed over the years; the most recent is described as a nonlinear integral equation based on counterbalancing the wind pressure on any point on the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point. As a demonstration of the tower's effectiveness in wind resistance, it sways only 6–7 cm (2–3 in) in the wind.

Some nuances and an unsettled question
I've tried to tone down some statements that seemed to me potentially exaggerated.  For example, the lede described EJ as an adviser to Presidents FDR and LBJ, but the main text did not fully support this statement, relating rather that (a) for a time, his work was read with interest by some in the Roosevelt White House, and (b) he informally advised Johnson while he was in Congress. There were also phrases that seemed a bit loosely applied, and/or POV in nature (e.g., describing FDR's fiscal policy as """"hyperactive"""" I think fails the POV test). 

I'm further troubled by the statements about EJ's purported anticipation of the rural S&L; crisis, but not sure I quite know enough on the subject to actually make changes (I've instead requested sourcing).  Two points of concern: (a) I'm not sure how relevant it is to predict in the mid-1970s a credit crunch that does not arrive until a decade later (also, to what extent his line of reasoning was accurate  i.e., did the cruch arrive due to factors that he identified, or for quite different reasons?), (b) the article currently relates that the credit crunch """"resulted in the savings and loan industry's troubles throughout farm country"""".  Is this accurate, or would it be closer to the truth to say that it resulted """"from"""" the S&Ls;' troubles?  Not my field of specialization: maybe someone else can take a lok at this passage?

Yes, this is my best answer. If you re-read my message carefully without your “emotional victimisation”, you will find my answer to your question. I understand in lack of proper answer to the request by uninvolved editor to provide sources backing your argument of denying a massacre, you decided to send a sentimental message. The reason discussion went nowhere is that you are trying to divert the attention from the actual discussion and keep slandering neutral sources and authors in an attempt to disqualify them, while so far you haven’t provided any firm counter source. 
Moreover, we have RfC open and we have a neutral person who responded the RfC. You should ask your questions on the board of RfC to be transparent instead of canvassing and posting here selective messages.

"""Actually, I became interested in editing this very short article (amid Wikipedia's invitation for us to participate in the survey, ending November 3), when all newspapers were flooded with Burlesque King. Nograles was forced to run naked in the hotel. Now, I was not a Wikipedian then, but, when, the landmark acquittal suit was published, I took time to edit this tersely. Nograles placed 2nd to my 1975 counsel in civil case, Atty. Henry R. Villarica, 92.35% higher than Ferdinand Marcos' 92.35% trimmed from 99% due to Marcos blunder in political law subject, in an En Banc review of his test results, 1939. Villarica owns more than 100 pawnshops, and is a very close friend-business assoc. of my brother, in gold and (they have 41/2 ha. Sta. Maria, Bulacan) fighting cock farm. I don't know Ateneo Law School Nograles, but due to the bar rating 2nd place, he is so brilliant. Now, in my 6,500 edits, I happened to have seen and edited like this controversy in bios of USA Senators, etc. So, I just follow the Wikipedia pattern. The difference between Dante Tinga and Nograles, is that, the former was cleared by the Court, but, the Nograles issue of censoring publication by libel lawsuit vs. the naked running, was condemned after Court acquittal for lack of evidence. In Nograles, the acquittal is best Wikipedia evidence to go forth with the edit on Nograles bio-naked thing. Remember the Beatrix of the Netherlands IP address fiasco caught by Wiki scanner? On August 31, 2007, Queen Beatrix’s royal family affirmed that Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, 38, and his wife Princess Mabel Wisse Smit edited the entry on Wikipedia which described Mabel’s relationship with slain drug baron Klaas Bruinsma (using the queen's palaces’ computer). The changes were found by Dutch media using Wiki Scanner - the entry which states Mabel provided """"incomplete and false information"""" about Bruinsma was changed to just """"incomplete information"""" in January 2006. My point is, in Tinga and Nograles, irrespective of Court acquittal or clearance, the publication of the bribe and Nog's U.P. Oblation run, respectively, with reliable sources, licenses us, editors, to add """"the thing."""" On short edits, I respect IT and other editors, since, it is a matter of style. If I were not a judge or lawyer, or if I were not an A.B. communication, editor, then, like IT and math editors, I would edit with a sentence or 2. But I keep my edits to 3 sentences for this reason: links die in time due to pay per view, and, scholars or readers of Wiki must be provided with a choice, to read more meats or essential ingredients. Also, the libel suit was filed by Nograles, et al. and the subject is the naked run. Now Nograles withdrew due to affidavit of desistance, but, the other complainant did not, and the Court decided based on trial's evidence. So, with more reasons must the edit be there and at the very least, even a sentence, but the essentials of the naked run ought to be there.
Final point. I do not personally know Tinga, but in 1978, I hired a lawyer of Santiago, Tinga, Fornier Law Office, to handle my simple Malolos case. Tinga became congressman and had been well known for this controversy, it is of judicial notice in IBP. Personally, I ignored these, until Douglas Anama, my text mate, the husband of Felipa Borlongan Anama, our Assistant Clerk of the Supreme Court (with the equivalent salary and rank of CA Justice) repeatedly approached me to consult dwarves, due to their case which Tinga decided against him, that's his family home. Tinga is not the only one who had these bribery things; Ynares-Santiago and M. Nazario (remember the Ramos notable contempt fine) shared the pie. My point is - the Court would instead put to rest the issue by fine or contempt. But for us editors, we just follow the pattern in USA bio of senators and public figures. Hence, my edit is well copy pasted from Wikipedia good articles on sub-section controversies. But of course, with all due respect to your edits. Sorry, for my TLDR, but it is so informative.

I am surprised by the claim that these were not agreed by other editors. Wiki publications encourage collaborative editing and nothing has to be agreed up front in this way.   

This image is clearly a photograph of another photograph, or poster, or leaflet.  Not only that, but its a badly framed snapshot, and is obviously the work of an amateur.  The image description is missing, and I do not believe that """"own work"""" is satisfactory for the source field given my concerns about the image.
MacRusgail you'd have a much easier time if you didn't sling insults and accusations around.  of Doom 
I agree that that's a poor quality image and shouldn't be included in the article.   
Parrot, you still need to inform the image author on commons that you have nominated the image for deletion, also it would help the deletion debate if you could give any reasons for your suspicions.   

Regarding the other two images (right), the County Hall one seems reasonable enough, but the festival one is badly framed. The lens is too zoomed in for my liking.   

The 'Oss picture conveys the feeling of the festival to me, crowded, almost claustrophobic. Would be nice if the editors who originally objectd came here themselves to give their reasons.   
Note that there's also an alternative photo of the festival at File:Red obby oss party 20050502.jpg.   
Which doesn't include an 'Oss.   
No, and I sense that may be important.   

I still fail to see what's so terrible about these pictures. By the way, if you're going to remove pictures, please substitute better ones. That way the article is improved, rather than depleted. 

Going through them:
 The Cornish language one is maybe the worst of the lot, but the reflection on the image is clearly on the """"Rooms"""" banner, not on the photograph. It is difficult to find better images of Cornish language use on Wikimedia. Otherwise we're reduced to road signs which use Cornish place names - and they're really loans into English, rather than proper Cornish language use. Two other options to replace first image are on the right.
 There is no way to frame the """"Obby Oss"""". It takes place amongst large crowds of people, often on old streets. Other than that, I can't see what the big deal is here.
 The County Hall picture is fine as far as I'm concerned. (However, if you wish a better one, there may well be one on Geograph which can be transferred onto Wikimedia.) It's a non-partisan image, and can't be accused of pandering to any political tendency.

""""MacRusgail you'd have a much easier time if you didn't sling insults and accusations around."""" - If I wished to insult people, I'd use much stronger language! What I object to is the use of deliberately obscure (and dubious)  abbreviations to justify edits, without a decent explanation as to why. Personally I would have preferred some kind of reasoning. At least that seems to be happening just now.

""""obviously the work of an amateur."""" - Most of the images on Wikipedia are amateur by definition. The professionals get paid for their images, and they don't give them away for everyone to use. A bit mean, but that's how things go. Since I live s",0

 sockpuppets on Physician

Thank you for reverting these edits.

I don' know why, but this article attracts lots of anonymous editors who like to delete without any explanation. I have asked a sysop (User:Shii) to semiprotect the article  he did this a month ago.

About 15 kilobytes (3/7 of the then total), including 2 large subsections, kept on being deleted by an apparent User:Nq0x77. One of the subsections (Other designations) has been in the article largely unchanged for well over a year; the wording here was earlier the subject of much discussion & editing because it concerned potentially controversial matters, but this was apparently resolved. When I tried Nq0x77's page to ask why, there was'nt one! No explanation of why the deletions are wise is shown on the Talk page. I've restored the article to the version left by User:Cubs197 earlier today, and you restored a further revert. The article has (or had)reached B class status, and is rated as top-importance, so I suggest major edits may merit at least some discussion, and I couldn't do this because User:Nq0x77 doesn't seem to be available.

 User:Shii wrote to me: just blocked the sockpuppet instead.  (tock) , and I have just replied: Thank you very much but, sadly, I think the same person is at it again, this time using a new and different sockpuppet (User: Pednursing ?), who has just made the same ~15kb deletion. Would semi-protect status stop this, or at least make it harder for him/her/it?

 Discussion moved from Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Doctor Who 

I know you're all probably sick to your back teeth of hearing about it, but considering how we have just changed the name of the 1996 television film to Doctor Who (1996) (in my personal opinion, an infinitely better name), why not try to resolve the seemingly never ending debate of whether it is 100,000 BC or An Unearthly Child? Talk:100,000 BC (Doctor Who)
 19:02, 9th January 2006 (GMT)

Okay can we also try to bring peace to the Middle East and Northern Ireland, bring harmony between all religions, sort out whether the UK is an international or European country and all those other things that have been fiercely argued a lot? ;-)  

I hate to say it, but I think the debate is about to get a second wind, seeing as the upcoming American DVD release, The Beginning dubs the story An Unearthly Child and also uses the Edge of Destruction name for the Inside the Spaceship two-parter...  

I think you're right, and that we should think about people less familiar with the original series; after all, a lot of people who have only watches the Ninth and Tenth Doctors in action will snap up the boxset, to learn more about Doctor Who. Calling it An Unearthly Child will not only help these """"newbies"""", but also seeth the feelings of quite a lot of Whovians I know. (As well as this, at least half of the sources I have seen - official or otherwise - call it """"An Unearthly Child"""").  20:39, 9 January 2006

The current opener to the article and the redirects handle the requirements anyway. Fandom has long been deeply divided and I don't think some notion of appeasing one wing of the debate should direct where the Wikipedia page is located.   
 I agree. As long as the proper redirects are in place and the article acknowledges the alternate titles, I think we're good. This isn't quite the same situation we had with the TV movie when an off-the-cuff remark by the producer calling it Enemy Within came to be seen as somehow official. (And the Doctor Who Information Network here in Canada apparently uses a different title altogether that was mentioned in a CBC profile of the series made to tie in with the Eccleston season. I forget the name that was used.).  

The CBC profile I think used """"Out of the Ashes"""", which apparently came from a misreading of Shannon Patrick Sullivan's webpage.  As for 100,000 BC vs. An Unearthly Child, I agree that the redirects and article opening make the issue less pressing, but I also think that the title used in the DVD release (which isn't just in the US, but UK as well) lends a bit more weight to the An Unearthly Child argument.  However, if we do reconsider the page's location, I agree that it shouldn't be about appeasing one group or another, but what's best for the article.  — (talk • contribs) 

The DVD releases seal it for me - these should both be at their DVD titles, with the others being redirects.  

That's a good point to raise. I personally believe that it should be An Unearthly Child; but then it's not up to me, and I fully understand where Josiah is coming from. Why don't we settle this once and for all: a democratic vote where Whovians like ourselves vote for one title or the other. Anyone else agree/have another idea?   16:18, 11 January 2006

I'll put my vote in as An Unearthly Child also.  

It's been said before, but I'll say it again. The title of the serial is 100,000 BC. The title of the first episode is """"An Unearthly Child"""". The fact that BBC Enterprises releases the DVD as """"An Unearthly Child"""" is a matter of marketing, not historicity, and neither here nor there. The real reason the serial was called An Unearthly Child to begin with was because of a mistake by the Radio Times. AUC redirects to the right page, and there's no confusion. I'd rather rename The Daleks to The Mutants rather than change 100,000 BC to that.  (talk • contribs) 16:39, 11 January 2006",0

The two sections could be split with more detail? The song is notable enough to have more than only 7 reliable reviews?

""""The"""" is used too much as an introduction to sentences.
""""alongside the bridge, is backed by wordless chants"""" -> alongside the bridge, and is backed by wordless chants.
""""Its instrumentation includes"""" -> This sentence will fit better as the second sentence of this section.
""""Due to"""" is a word to avoid.
""""number"""" -> song/track
""""Brian Mansfield from USA Today thought the song's..."""" -> felt that the song's
""""Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, complimented"""" -> replace """"gave"""" with """"awarded"""" and the sentence is very deconstructive and redundant, rather quote a sentence or two from the review.
""""while Entertainment Weekly writer"""" -> avoid the word """"while"""" as much as possible.

Commercial performance
""""from the parent album"""" -> from its parent album.
""""When """"One Thing"""" and """"What Makes You Beautiful"""" ..."""" -> One Direction became the second act of 2012 to have two singles simultaneously occupying the chart's top ten when """"One Thing"""" was at number six and """"What Makes You Beautiful"""" at number ten for the chart week ending 22 April 2012.

And no, this isn't a """"fake Serbia"""" like the NDH was a fake Croatia, it was a military occupation zone """"in Serbia"""", the """"Serbia"""" referred to there is just a geographic qualification indicating where this entity is located in. You need to clear from your head all that """"Nedićeva Srbija"""" nonsense that they teach us in grade school. The Serbian article actually has a flag and coat of arms under an infobox title that says """"Serbia"""", and you just called this a """"country"""". I'll say it again: this is an occupation zone created by Hitler, where his army picked some willing stooges to run the police and collect taxes/steal food. Hitler hated Serbs with a passion and didn't give them anything even closely resembling a country. It takes a special kind of crazy to go around fighting for recognition screaming """"hey, don't you go denigrating Serbia! we were just as much Nazi puppets as you were!"""".

I wanted to be a touch more exact on some of the parts for Mugen’s character. He’s such an interesting character that even though he is almost purely made up out of the minds of the creators, he still has a few bits of actual historical pertinence to him.

The part I’m addressing now is the interesting way in which he comes back to life by meeting the “Shamans” as referred to in his character profile. In the Okinawan belief system, these shamans are called “futuki” and they are the only spirits from the other world who intercede into human affairs.

These beings are generally thought to be an individual's own direct ancestors (both male and female), and the same individual's future descendants (which makes it kind of interesting that Mugen has a center place in the ongoing line of them; maybe there is something to the theory that Spike is his descendant...). Anyway, the futuki are generally masked and wear feathered cloaks, and are indistinguishable from each other, at least in this world. During one of the many interesting flashback montage’s, we see not only the long line of them, but one watching Mugen from the road through the forest, and a couple of other spots, which suggests to me that he's someone they're keeping an eye on. It would make sense by traditional Okinawan beliefs but it is pure speculation on my part.

The feathered apparel particularly have always made me wonder about that tropical looking red bird that seems to observe Mugen so closely in that grove; maybe another spirit observer? And it might also be interesting to note that the underworld where he deals with the futuki, Nirai-kanai, is represented in Okinawan folklore as an island you can only reach by swimming underwater; if you try to sail there it'll always be on the horizon no matter how far you go. I think that's why everything there appears upside down, you have to """"sink to rise"""" there, so to speak; and Mugen """"falls back to the surface"""" when he leaves that place.

A long metal pipe is inserted into the animals' esophagus several times a day. The process can cause the animals' internal organs to rupture. Several European countries and the state of California have outlawed the practice as cruel. Do you agree or disagree that force-feeding geese and ducks to produce foie gras should be banned in Pennsylvania?""""
Now, considering the question, the fact that 94% of respondents had either never eaten the stuff (54% had never even heard of it), can you see that this is the very definition of a push poll? If general indicators are any indication, the fact that a large number of chefs in the Chicago area decided to put or keep foie gras on their menu (some of them had never served foie gras before), and that this eventually led to the repeal of the Chicago ban on foie gras, then the assertion that most chefs do not support the ban of foie gras sounds like a reasonable conclusion.

 Sloppy use of the word """"criticise"""". 

In the sentence, """"References to testosterone poisoning are used as a convenient way to criticize men,"""" the word """"criticize"""" is used in an ambiguous and unhelpful way.  Granted, in the vernacular, """"criticise"""" is used as synonym for """"denigrate"""", """"defame"""", """"castigate"""" and """"belittle"""", but in an encyclopedic context, it would probably be a good idea to restrict it to its scholarly and intellectual sense of """"study closely"""" (which is clearly not the sense meant here).

I'd venture to say that its use in this sense is one piece of evidence that the Usage section at the very least could use some rewriting.""",0

 Walking in on the middle of an argument 

Thanks for the message, however the analogy you've chosen is incorrect, when I walk in on an argument then I cannot have heard what has happened before, however on a talk page I can read the whole thing and trace any talk page discussion. When I posted my first question was intentionally dumbed down, as if I didn't know what was going on, then as the replies came in I could respond to them. In terms of NPOV in articles this is how I see it; for example, person A writes and article which contains the phrase """"Scientology is bad"""", there is then an article written about Person A, Mr A was born in..., and on..., and live with..., et cetera. Then under his work it says """"He wrote an article saying 'Scientology is Bad'"""". I could not in all conscience remove that statement from the article, because the bias is from the speaker not the editor. The gist of the talk page on WP:SCN was that any negative comments which had been quoted accurately but were negative should be """"balanced"""" out. And that is not something I could let happen.

Ok, then the section should be condensed to discuss the aspects in particular where D contributes to generic programming. If Dmeranda is correct in that """"static if"""" is a completely other take on generics then that point need to be discussed and exemplified, and I'm not certain if the factorial example is an adequate illustration of this since I failed to get that point. Also, the alias parameters seems to be of relevance and a discussion about these should be added. Static derival of return types risks venturing into pure language comparisons since C++0x will be equipped with a of_type (forgot what it is to be named) static operator and other languages have this facility too.

I see your point, but I think the difference is that we aren't talking about translations and romanizations. That is what we are using already (romanizations). For example Vegeta instead of Bejita or Vejita. Noone's using unnofficial romanizations, or straight romaji or kanji, which is why I get riled up when I see the """"use english"""" argument. So I hope I didnt come off as contentious. It's just that I think people misuse the word translation. I dunno if you saw the old Mr. Satan/Hercule argument. Points on commonality were certainly worth discussing, but a number of the more vocal people were insisting that Mr. Satan was a Japanese phrase and Hercule it's translation. That isn't what translation is. The thing is, and I think a lot of people forget, is that English-language wiki is a language choice, not a subset of countries that we are allowed to write articles about. English wiki is worldwide, like every other wiki. Most other wikis get this too. Look at the French wiki. The French dub named Piccolo as Satan (Kami being god of earth, they figured his evil counterpart would be the devil) and then changed Mr. Satan to Hercule (that's where the name comes from). But the articles their were on Piccolo and Mr. Satan, making note that when adapted into french the names Satan and Hercule were used.
On attacks- those are likely going to be restructered soon anyway. As for why in most cases we used names from the Daizenshuu attack list, it is because that is the only comprehensive list that exists. I have tried... really hard... to work such a list based on the dub and even Viz manga. You can't. The manga doesn't cover every aspect of the series and misses some attacks, and Viz is weird with attacks (keeps some the same, half-translates some, translates some into Chinese). The dub has some that are the same or translations, some with names invented for the dub, some attacks misnamed as other existing attacks, some attacks with multiple names, and some attacks without names at all. For example, Piccolo's old signature move that you see in games more often now was the Bakurikimaha. You saw it when he attacked Raditz on the cliff. Gohan's first signature was the Masenko. According to the dub these two distinct techniques are the same move and called Masenko-ha. Goku's last ditch move is the Genki Dama and Yamcha's signature ki attack is the Sokidan. According to the dub they were both Spirit Bomb, and the Sokidan has also been renamed Spirit Ball. Tenshinhan's signature Kikoho has been called between dub, manga, and games the Tri Beam, Blast Cannon, Ki Blast Cannon, and Chi Kung Blast. It just gets confusing trying to keep track. And then there are moves that don't get named, like Freeza's Death Ball pr the Big Bang Attack. They get named as such now because of video games, which are translated from Japanese, which goes by the Daizenshuu list, so any attack that doesn't have a dub rename tends to be some form or translation of the original name (since no dub equivolent exists for them). 
 I really hoped that makes sense... its like 3 in the morning here, so if it didn't let me know and I'll clarify.  """,0

It only remains to be seen what the name """"Bishonen"""" means, but I doubt it's anything remotely intellectual, probaby just a cartoon reference or something. You can block me for 48 hours, but on this evidence, Wikipedia is going to be a poor excuse of a website encyclopedia for life. On further investigation, the 1st Lord seems to have got me blocked by crying to admins, which seems apt, seeing as he's probably just a child himself. Presumably the use of the phrase """"Bishonen with her finger on the trigger"""" over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that).""",1

"Request for reconsideration:  Deletion of Bullshido.net entry 

Requesting you re-examine the arguments in [], as per WP:DRV.

Your summary of my argument is factually false.  My argument was that the addition of four [more [reliable sources should carry weight.  The statement that the Real Fighter article was not neutral based upon some colorful language suggests your inexperience with publications about mixed martial arts.  Also, you gave us no time whatever to contact Sean Treanor and learn more from him; in any case, an article hosted on Stanford's Graduate Program in Journalism webpage, and not on a student's personal website within stanford.edu, could hardly have failed to undergo peer review or professorial supervision.

Furthermore, regarding the Real Fighter article, , the President of the American Sambo Association, took time out of his day to inform the discussion about how the article got produced:

My name is Stephen Koepfer and I wrote the original Bullshido article/investigation on Geraci. I wanted to share my account regarding how the RF acticle came into being, since my name has come up here. Sacha Feinman, a noted journalist http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sacha-feinman/17/400/976 contacted me about writing an article about Geraci. He was, as any good journalist would be, concerned with not simply regurgitating our investigation. However, reading my article, he felt it was well written, ivestigated, etc. He felt it would be a good springboard for further investigation. So, I provided all my sources to Feinman. He vetted the entire Bullshido piece, found it to be verifiable, and continued to investigate the case in further directions which Bullshido had not covered. As Feinman noted himself it was the Bullshido article which formed the basis for his own further investigation. Feinman and I did not collaborate on his article, other than my making introductions to sources and the subject, Geraci. Feinman was not paid by Bullshido, nor is he even a member of the site. He came to us because of our notability. I fail to see how the RF article, regardless of how much or little it sepcifically mentions Bullshido in print, could not be considered a notable reference for Bullshido. Our ivnestigation served as the springboard for his, he came to us because of our notability, he personally stated this as such, and the subject of the investigation itself (Geraci) is quoted in the RF article as saying the Bullshido investigation was accurate.

This addresses both the neutrality and the reliability issues, and you didn't mention it in your summary. Nor did you mention Carol Kaur's well-reasoned argument, which contained novel points to which no one had a reasonable answer.

The only policies on which you seemed to be amenable to a flexible reading were those involving the definition of consensus.  If Bullshido's similarity to an epithet is no grounds for considering its lack of coverage in a different light, neither are the repeated calls for deletion a basis on which to go with an impossibly loose definition of consensus.

I respectfully submit that your summary of consensus was factually wrong on several points, and ask you to reconsider.",0

In Vukovar I do not see that you are striving so to put Serbian-Cyrillic version in the infobox, and there ar Serbians over 25%. In Croatia, there are also other locations where Serbs and other minorities live, but their share of the total population is not so much, so I added not there the Serbian name. So it should be also in Serbia. In Novi Sad are not even 4% of Hungary, and for the city names in other languages where are the minorities of a city are not significante, we have the section name, so what ist the problem?.

"""

 It would be useful if you dated your comments, it's much easier to follow the dates that way, rather than checking the history. I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:

It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.

 That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.

 Let me explain what I mean with my """"intuitiveness"""" concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply """"antigravity"""" to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's """"beating"""" some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to """"beat"""" as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn't really exist, that confuses the reader (""""then what's the force that I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn't get it right..."""") and s/he's most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  """,0
"Summary of situation  User:ShimShem has taken a dislike to this article, and has tried numerous methods to either get it deleted or its name changed.

I was originally unsure of the motives of this editor - why they were completely desperate to delete or move this article - until I noted they were interested in Tamil subjects, one of which is M.I.A. (artist), and guessed that they believed that the two could be confused.  Their subsequent creation of the article M I A as a redirect to M.I.A. (artist) proved this, as far as I am concerned.  

As to whether the band is actually called MIA or M.I.A., it differs.  The band itself uses M.I.A. as the heading on their own website, but then uses a combination of both elsewhere.  Since in the case of most sources, this is only likely to be laziness (much as R.E.M. are regularly referred to as REM), and since the article has existed here for a while, and that all the backlinks go to this version, and most of all because we shouldn't let disruptive users get their way, the article should stay here.",0

Speedy deletion of The outlyers
 A tag has been placed on The outlyers requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called """"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what their ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. 
And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion towards Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries. This is a typical way of overcoming any kind of ‘distaste’ in a human and civilized way, all the other ways are just a shame for humanity.

Besides being inconsistent, your criteria are arbitrary.
And they are your criteria. You've got a serious problem with ownership of this article; it's very nice that you've done so much work on it, but if you want to enforce your own version on everyone else, Wikipedia is not the place to be publishing.
How ironic that you're complaining about me removing """"relevant cited information"""" (ie. one guy's opinion) from the introduction while you are at the same time removing relevant cited information from the body. Scholars describe it as a genre. That is enough.
You claim that adding this genre makes the list useless to the reader, but that's a very silly claim, because quite the opposite is true: suppressing genres because of the opinion of one writer (or really, because of the opinion of one editor) makes Wikipedia a less useful and trustworthy reference. In Rescue opera, we can go into detail about scholars' thoughts on its coherency as a genre, but the list structure of this article is not set up to deal with competing theories: Charlton's opinion that everyone else is wrong has no place here, and certainly not pride of place.

Frustration with repeated deletions and un-sourced additions by Jrkso

Jrkso,

I would like to think that you are editing in good faith - but you make it hard!  You seem to just pull ideas out of your head, delete well-sourced facts (repeatedly), and replace them with your personal concoctions - sources be damned.

Latest of many examples (for more, see Talk page, above):

You have now decided that the Taliban killed Sitara Achakzai, so you just plopped that into the article in the """"Government and Politics"""" section.  You provide no sources for this """"new discovery"""", no explanation.  You just went for it (adding bolded words, below): 

""""Women in public life in many parts of the country are subject to routine threats and intimidation, according to a December, 2009 report by Human Rights Watch. Several high profile women have been assassinated, but their killers have not been brought to justice. When Sitara Achakzai, an outspoken and courageous human rights defender and politician, was murdered by the Taliban in April 2009, her death was seen as another warning to all women who are active in public life.""""

Do you honestly believe that you are contributing in a worthwhile way to Wikipedia with these methods?  Your seem to be intent not so much on re-writing the article, but on trying to re-write history itself.  No sources, no explanations, no sense.

And it gets worse.  On the edit page, where you again deleted facts, you seem to be explaining a deletion with this comment: 'Danieldis47, such a statement ... a """"transparent election is not possible."""" is POV ... how can that not be possible?)""""  

Man - It's a quote from the candidate himself!  It's HIS explanation for why he quit (not mine!)  That's why it is in quotes!  Would you delete an excerpt from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on Lincoln's page because it's his point of view (POV?)??

I am entirely frustrated here.   

I suggest we seek third-party mediation.

In §4.2 """"MLA style"""" (pp 104-5), it tells us that MLA style is to use inline citations such as """"(Marcuse 197)"""", adding a bibliography in which the reader may see that """"Marcuse"""" is Sibyl Marcuse's book A Survey of Musical Instruments and necessary publication info. But look, I've no more wish to dwell on what this or that particular MoS says than you do, and I'll stick that book back on its shelf where it may deservedly gather more dust.

Biased?
I am curious as to why it would seem that the U.S was singled out for a complete page on national racism? - I have yet to find a page dedicated to racism in other countries such as Africa, Britain, Mexico, Brazil, Iran, etc etc. 

Why is it that a whole page is dedicated to racism in the U.S as if it is/was the only country to marginalize persons by race?

I believe that this page should be merged into a general page of world racism, or just be deleted altogether, it's a little more than """"biased"""" in my opinion.  

See Racism by country. We deal with the """"bias"""" of missing articles on Wikipedia by writing new articles. See WP:CSB if you want to help provide a more global view. By the way, people who say Africa is a country might raise a few hackles among other editors writing about racism. 

The situation in the United States is unique in terms of its special brand of racism, the completeness of the...the campaign against Native Americans, the special circumstances surrounding the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the particularities of this version of slavery, the premises and outcome of the Civil War, and especially the complex time period following emancipation. This period is fairly unique in many ways, including but not limited to the fact that a bifurcated society developed with the former slave class developing in parallel alongside the former slave-owning class with visible distinctions in terms of melanin and linguistic distinctions resulting from the circumstances of the previous centuries, the long process of segregation, Jim Crow, the rise of African-American influence on mainstream American culture, KKK, White Citizens Councils and lynchings, and the long drive for the abolition of Jim Crow and the securing of the right to vote not only on paper but in practice, and the fact that many of the goals have been achieved, though how thorough this achievement has been is still a topic of debate. Most historical precedents result in one race wiping out the other, either by killing or displacement. To merge this article would be like merging an article on the Second world War into a general article on War, or merging the article on Homo Sapiens into an article on mammals. It makes no sense.
The truth hurts, but it's still the truth. This is a website for facts.

I see where you hesitated with the ellipsis.  The American campaign against the Natives involved such things as biological warfare, enslavement, mass rape, forced migration, and ordinary massacres. It was nothing less then genocide.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.132.84.67   """,0

I guess JFD is trying to discourage you to get in touch with me via e-mail, since he fears some kind of academical threat. Just to clear some things up, I was not the guy who went """"India did not exist until 1947"""". I would never post something as blunt, offensive, and ignorant as that. However, yes, I have changed a few things around as a correction. It is not to offend anyone, but like Kenneth Tennyson and his devoted sidekick JFD (the Green Hornet and Kato), I too have some historical points of views. I understand that you have been accused of being a pan-Indian nationalist, while I have been accused of being a Tamil nationalist. As far as Indian martial arts are concerned, martial arts from both your culture and mine are in the Indian martial arts section. Therefore, it effects both of us.

It seems like through this wiki-conflict, it has thrown us together into one pot. If I am here to put you or your culture down, or to discredit India, why in the first place would I have stuck up for you. I had not intentions in mind when I did that. It just ticked me off when Kenneth sent you that messed up message. Just like, for example, a few years ago, when a Punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime. I was outraged...

I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam. Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine both our knowledge to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a """"give-take"""" mentality we can make things work.

At the same time, we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD-Kenny think, but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts.

Do you agree with me on this? If so, it would be nice if we could communicate via e-mail. I have more ideas to share with you. I believe we can make this work. As far as JFD is concerned, I do not know what his intentions are. Maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project? or maybe I am wrong... Indrancroos

Due to space limitations and the need to purchase mobile units to accomplish integration at the elementary school level, the Federal District Judge in Greensboro gave a year delay for the integration of the elementary schools.
The principals of Durham County's high schools were all employed during legal segregation. A lot of discussion took place by whites and African Americans in the Durham community about how successful the process of integration would be in Durham County.

 Pearl Buck illustrators 

Personally, I am aware of no precedents for including references to illustrators of works in the biography of the author. Such content could reasonably I think be added to the content in the bio of the illustrator, but from what little I know the author doesn't necessarily choose the illustrator, so there's not necessarily any real connection between the author per se and the illustrator. Having said all that, inclusion of such info in the articles on the books themselves makes perfect sense, and if it can be established that there was a degree of personal contact between an author and an illustrator, that could be referenced in the article too. But personally I can't see justifying the existing section in the article in question. I'll make similar contents on the talk page if you so request, but I'm kinda new to the biography project so I can't cite previous cases as well as I might like.",0

Hello!

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

Pick an image name.
When uploading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

Source the image.
On the image description page, explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

Provide copyright and license information.
This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{PD}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using {{PD}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
If you didn't create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might """"create"""", but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as """"only for use by Wikipedia"""", or """"for non-commercial use only"""", or """"for educational use"""".  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under fair use, but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

Describe the image.
To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject:

"Foroyaa: Do you have any other involvement apart from politics and trade unionism?
Alh. Cham Joof: Yes, I was the founder and Secretary General of the First Gambian Youth Movement called the Central Council of Youth in the Gambia, in 1957 and I helped to build the Central Council headquarters at Allen Street.
We used to organise annual youth week and sporting events. All kinds of sports were staged including cycling in which Alhagie O.B Conateh (Fisco) used to participate. 
In the field of scouting also, I have been named the doyen of Scouting in the Gambia. Scouting, which is a supplementary to education, was dear in my heart and I served the movement from 1938 up to date. I was the first Gambian Scout to be awarded the coveted badge known as the Wood Badge by the Chief Scout of the World at a successful training course held at the International Training Centre at Gillwell Park in Sussex, England, in 1953. I was also appointed by the Gambia Scouts Council to represent the youths at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth in June 1953.
I also had the opportunity to be selected as the Leader of the Gambia Contingent at the World Scout Jamboree held at Sutton Cold Field in Birmingham in 1957.
As a scout I grew up from Wolf cum Scout, Scout Master, Commissioner in Charge of Training and retired as the President of the Gambia National Scout Council in 2005.
I attended the First Pan-African Youth Movement Conference in Tunisia in 1960 and the second in 1961. I was able to meet Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda and I had the privilege of travelling with Kaunda in the same plane and we had fruitful discussions about politics. I also helped in the creation of a Unit called the Hansard Unit at the National Assembly in 2002 and I was appointed as a member of the International Committee of Dispute Resolution in 2002.
I was also appointed as a member of the Dispute Tribunal Unit of the Magistrates Court in Banjul in 2003 and I retired in 2007.
I am the current chairman of ECO (Education through Culture Organisation) which is an International NGO.
I do part time lecture at the University of the Gambia on History and the students do come to my house for lectures.
I also wrote books on various subjects in the Gambia.

"Holby series/characters 

Hi there,
I know you've been doing a fair bit of contributing to the various Holby City series and character pages recently. I see you've been adding various wards after character's names and job titles, though I think it's got to a point where the lists are tending to look a little cluttered. As the editor who added the character lists to the individual series pages in the first place, the intention was to only include the ward that each characters usually appeared on - the one they were resident on - rather than just the wards that they popped up on from time to time. As such, this is why I've been keeping characters such as Guy Self and Colette Sheward in the list without a ward, as they do not appear to be formally allocated to a particular ward. Where there have been multiple wards listed, this has been due to the characters moving between wards over the course of the series, such as recently when Ric Griffin and Michael Spence swapped roles on Keller and AAU, respectively, during Series 15, hence their listing there as Keller/AAU and AAU/Keller. 
As such, I'm proposing, for brevity's sake, as well as for clarity, that the wards listed be kept to a minimum - each character's principal ward only, rather than any that they occasionally appear on (for argument's sake, pretty much all characters appear on AAU from time to time, but that doesn't mean they should have AAU listed after their names). The alternative is that we do away completely with having characters' wards listed after their names.
I've reverted the list to its former appearance, in the process removing a couple of things (Dominic isn't on AAU, Edward (who, incidentally, left the show in Episode 13, and has been removed from the opening titles and the BBC website) wasn't on Keller, and Nathan and Mr Thompson were never given allocated named wards). 
Let me know what you think - it may be that the complete removal of wards may be the easiest way forward!",0

There's no need to compromise an article to placate cranks on the Talk page; respond to them on the Talk page.  
There are separate questions:
Why is it called the """"World Series""""? 
Is it justifiable to call it """"World Series""""? 
Is """"World Series"""" meant literally or just a label preserved for historic/traditional reasons?
Regarding the answers:
The answer would appear to be: 1880s hype + 120 years of tradition/inertia.  
The first bit should be in the history section. The reference says In 1884, the Providence Grays of the National League outplayed the New York Metropolitan Club of the American Association in a three game series for what was originally called """"The Championship of the United States."""" Several newspapers penned the Grays as """"World Champions"""" and the new title stuck. 
It would be nice to cite an 1884 newspaper saying something like """"The Grays are now the Champions of the United States; indeed one might well call them the Champions of the World."""" 
""""the new title stuck"""" is rather vague: did it stick instantly and unanimously? Looking at the contemporary match programs on baseball alamanac, 1911 is World's Championship Games, 1912 is World's Series, 1930 is for the Championship of the World, 1940 is World's Series, 1941 is World Series. It's worth distinguishing """"World Series"""" the series of matches from """"World Championship"""" the title at stake in the series.
The """"New York World"""" urban myth is widespread enough to be mentioned and debunked. 
 """"The title of this championship may seem odd to some readers"""" is not a justification for answering this question, since it relates to the previous question. The justification would be something like """"Some people have (jocularly or otherwise) questioned the appropriateness or accuracy of the name World Series""""  
I speculate that there should be some juicy examples of such questioning from U.S. journalists in the 1880s, or Latin Americans in the 1960s.  There is the quote attributed to John Cleese: """"When we [the UK] hold a World Championship for a particular sport, we invite teams from other countries to play, as well.""""  
There are various arguments pro and contra that might be made. But only those that have actually been made by noteworthy sources should be given. 
The relevant information seems to be present in the article.

"Personal Experience 

Since there isn't much to this article (or stub), I thought I would add some of my own personal experience with phenibut. I use it occasionally for insomnia. In my opinion, it is not a long term solution for insomnia. Tolerance develops for me within three days of consecutive use. I have never had a problem with withdrawal, but I have heard that is possible, but not life threatening, just uncomfortable.

Phenibut does has a long half-life so usage should be spaced out. I would recommend a maximum of one day usage according to label instructions, then a minimum of two days off. One use a week would be preferable.

It does work well for insomnia, and tends to produce vivid dreams, which is interesting, but its usage should be carefully monitored.

When used as directed, I have heard of no major side effects. It will increase the potency of sedatives, so that must be kept in mind.

This is just my own personal experience, hopefully more people will add to the discussion.",0

The society has had many a notable event prescribed to its name. For example, a student whom is now a astronaut with NASA was once a humble member - Andy Thomas that is. Several other events throughout time, such as the hanging of a car on the torrents footbridge, the disassembly and reassembly of a entire vehicle into a corridor of the third level of engineering south, the stealing and ransom of Ronald McDonald from the myer center - all were orchestrated by AUES members. The way I have explained them here makes such events seem only of interest to a quite narrow, local, audience, but when thought about, they are things which can be told in such a way that they are of interest to the greater population. Things such as the hot water system in the Crown and Anchor pub, in the city, being removed by students during one of the engie pub crawls would also be notable, in my opinion.

Qwyrxian, let me attempt to point out the flaws of your response to my arguments set forth above: Yes, I'm a new editor, however, with all due respect, that has no bearing on your inclination to decide on behalf of all viewers what should be made available to them.

I very much understand the purpose of Wikipedia.  My assertion is NOT that the middle-finger incident should be included in the subject article (I started) because of news reports, as you contend.  If you will review the foregoing, the reason why I cited the news reports is because a flagrantly reckless comment was inserted that what is of issue now is not worthy of documenting when the exact opposite is true; the news reports is best evidence in that regard, and the person who said it is not worthy has only but his mouthan inferior source of 'evidence,' relatively speaking.  It is noteworthy, and, if you can come to appreciate the context of the subject's profession and for which has become known to be involved in, then you'll come to appreciate the significance it plays out in the essential need to properly reflect the entirety of the trial in which the subject became a major fixture as co-counsel.

Your example of everyday political speeches is seriously an aytypical example by which to convey your point:  Contrary to a mudane, everyday speech, here, an attorney just allegedly got out of court in obtaining a siginficant finding in his client's favordefeating immense odds and seemingly going against the court of public opinionand just afterwards gathered with his team at a restaurant just down the street from that historic victory, during which he released the manifestation of his emotions, etc., as one could imagine.  This was included as part of a segment of the whole article of the article-there is no article specifically on this incident, so let's also come to appreciate that.

And, to the contrary that this incident is of interest only at the moment, more and more discussions are being held about the audacious incident, and has cultivated an interest in what happens next, as if it is leading to a whole host of other actions (whether that includes the filing of a bar complaint, etc.), and this leads us to the national grand scale interest of the audacity of officers of courts acting in such a manner, etc.

Furthermore, I concede that Wikipedia is not in existence for the greater good, and that was never my contentio.  Again, you misunderstood the context I place in the words, """"public interests."""" Going back to the above, it is incontrovertible that is of the interests of the public, and, consequently, it should be documented well because, as noted in the latter paragraph, it is beginning to take shape in having a lasting impact on what we have come to expect from individuals, such as the subject of the article.

Let otherscertainly at least those who helped me in creating the articlechime in with their thoughts before you take an action on behalf everyone else.  Let's not do something in such a haphazard way.  Do not deny information in haste.   """,0

"""{{unblock|THANK YOU for a reasonable fucking comment!!! The ONLY USER in ANY AREA who has actually made one!!  (Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being """"confrontational"""" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.

The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.

So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion.

I've contacted Nohat about information on those recordings by Ladefoged that are linked from the articles on individual sounds and I did some recordings of ejective consonants. I'd like to make an attempt at making some sort of standard for future phonologies too.

Also, if you feel you can wade through all the (sometimes quite heated) debate at Swedish phonology and Standard Swedish, I'd appreciate it. But I certainly won't blame you for avoiding it. It's gotten a bit uncivil occasionally and we're currently trying to mediate with help of . -/

Have you though of joining Wikipedia:WikiProject Phonetics? That would seem like a good place to start working on a proper inventory of the pronunciations recordings available and such. I think we should consider trying to organize Commons:Category:Pronunciation as well.  20:51, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)",0

 It is all just terminology 

Perhaps all this argument is about nothing but terminology.  Does anyone disagree with any of the following statements?  It is assumed throughout that the car is placed randomly, the players initial pick is random, and that the host always opens an unchosen door to reveal a goat.

1) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened door 3, is between 1/2 and 1 depending on the hosts door preference. (This is clearly a conditional probability)

2) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened door 2, is between 1/2 and 1 depending on the hosts door preference. (This is clearly a conditional probability)

3) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors, is 2/3 for all host preferences. (Morgan call this the unconditional case, maybe this is where the confusion arises).

4) The probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked a door and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors is 2/3 for all host preferences.

5) The probability of winning by switching on average for player who switch is 2/3 for all host preferences.

  
You're right. And notice that in case 3, opening one of the unchosen doors is not a condition, because it is part of the rules of the game. The only condition, if you would consider the full model, there is the initial picking of door 1. In case 4 there is no condition at all in the full model and hence it is the same as case 5. But ... notice that in the MHP a specific door has been chosen and a door opened.  

I continue here. The difficulty is what we do mean by probability. If you mean an average over all cases in which any door has been opened, there is, as I mentioned, no condition. If you mean: a door has been opened, but I do not know which one, and I want to average over all cases concerning the same door, the answer depends on the door and is a number between 1/2 and 1.   

I do not quite agree with you.  If we average over all cases where a door has been opened, but you do not know which one, the answer is 2/3 if we include all possible host strategies in our average.  The only way to get an answer other than 2/3 is to average over cases where the host has a fixed strategy and the same door is opened every time.   

Nijdam, do you see the connection with my simple problem in which a prize is placed behind one of two doors and the player then picks a door?  If the player picks randomly the probability of winning is 1/2.  If the player has picked just one specific door then the probability of winning depends on the initial prize placement.   
  
Who else agrees?   

I agree with #1 and #2.  I find #3, #4 and #5 somewhat ambiguous without further clarification, for example I don't know precisely what you mean by """"for all host preferences"""".  I would agree with the following revised versions:

By 'for all host preferences' I mean regardless of whether the host policiy is to: always open door 2 where possible, always open door 3 where possible, choose randomly where there is a choice, or employ any other method of deciding which door to open within the stated rules.   
  
3) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1, is 2/3.

4) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked a door, is 2/3.

5) The probability of winning by switching on average for players who switch is 2/3.

These are clearly """"unconditional"""" statements that say nothing about the player deciding after the",0

 Pre Christmas Review 

Hi Spinning, 
I'm doing a quick review on your edits right now... One of the things that you need to remember is our primary purpose here is to build the encyclopedia.  Coaching is secondary as is working towards adminship.  I noticed that you've read a few of my recent essays on CSD, I know this because you've made edits to my essay on why I hate speedy deleters.  I appreciate the edits.  Another essay that I would suggest you take a look at is my essay on my coaching philosophy and what it means to be work with an adminly spirit.  One of the key things that I look at isn't """"Does the candidate have the right edit counts in various places"""" or """"Does the candidate know policy backwards and forwards, but rather do they have the spirit of an admin.""""  Do people respect the candidate and do they act as in a manner that instills confidence and respect from the community.  Do they embody what I think an admin encapsulates?  To me being an admin isn't about the buttons, one can (and should) be an admin before they ever submit themself to the community!

That being said, I encourage you to look at this edit.  I like the fact that you use your user space to keep notes and work on articles.  This shows a sign of somebody who has been burnt by CSD'ers ;-)  No, in reality, I think developing ideas and concepts in the user space should be encourage.  Is  a list of things that you'd like to work on?  If so, what have you succeeded in acomplishing in the past?  Eg, what isn't there that might have been there 2 months ago?

I am puzzled at how wikipedia is moderated! Will someone please explain this to me?

I'm happy to answer your questions, but I'm not exactly what your question is - what do you mean by """"moderated"""", precisely? All of the content you see on Wikipedia is contributed by users like yourself, making it a sort of very large scale collaboration project. So if your use of the word """"moderation"""" refers to the removal of vandalism, the answer is fairly simple: it too is all done by users, who keep a close eye on the recent changes around Wikipedia.

 Spam hunter! 

Hi A.B.  Thanks for all the reports and for all the work you do on finding new spammed domains.  I am impressed by your last report on WT:WPSPAM.

I have a question and a suggestion, though.  The question: when you report, could you for IPs that spam wikipedia include the range where that IP is in (preferably the CIDR).  That makes it easier to blacklist IPs on COIBot (not that it is a trouble for me to find them).  The suggestion, you might be interested in the IRC channels Link additions on en.wikipedia and edits on small wikipedia.  The former runs a linkwatcher, shadowbot, COIBot etc.  On the latter normally also a linkwatcher is active (but it is down at the moment), as are some other watching bots (also COIBot is there).  We also have some other nifty tools (though again, one that you might be very interested in is also down at the moment).

I have no concerns about his edit, but it is unsourced. I trust this guy, but we may have to wait until his Encyclopedia about Galliformes comes out and totally revises the taxonomy. Pinudjem is his second part of his middle name (Amoun-Pinudjem) of his alternate name (Milad Sourial). If you search for that name on the web you can see that he is making a movie called """"Goddess of the Sun"""", not only from the photo gallery concerning the Green Peafowl but also from a site not by him.

Kermit does not have a real name. His real parents gave him a name he didn't like. Sadly, his real parents died in a political assacination. He was then named Kermit Roosevelt by his adoptive parents, but he didn't like that either. He has three user accounts: User:Amoun-Pinudgem (middle name), User:Milad A.P. Sourial, and his newest is User:Pinudjem. However, he has also edited with an IP once, which was reverted. He often writes under Kermit Blackwood and was also quoted in the Red Data Book as K. B. Woods (who suggested that Greens are monogamous and possible Yunnan subspecies).

He is a writer on the Feathersite, a site that talks about poultry, wild ducks and gamebirds, etc.

One must know that Kermit is not sure that the Green Peafowl is a superspecies complex, but that he created that hypothesis, and that he believes the best way to know the truth is to try and disprove it. However, preliminary data confirms his hypothesis of multiple species. He has already collected tissue samples and compared them but he believes it is better if nuclear DNA can also be extracted from samples.

Wolfgang Mennig, a breeder who suggests that there are additional subspecies (not species), also confirms (he e-mailed me) that he is friends with Kermit and that they try to work together as much as possible.  """,0

(2) I have prsented sourced evidence from individual G8 websites, created by respective governments, that the EU is a member.  Nowhere is there any official statement that the EU is not a member. Some people are arguing that when it says the EU joined the G8, the word join has some special meaning (and they must therefore accept that Canada is not a member becasue I have shown the sentence where it says that both Canada and the EU 'joined'). 
(3) I have pointed out that most of the official G8 websites are quoting from the same source, so the contentious phrasing recure. 
(4) Lucy-marie quotes the sentence """"The European Union is represented at the G8 by the president of the European Commission and by the leader of the country that holds the EU presidency."""" Of course it is. This sentence in many sources follows on from the sentence that says that countries are represented by their Head of State/Government and is needed simply because the EU does not have a Head of State/Government. It doesn't mean anything else. 
(5) Lucy-marie further quotes """"The EU does not take part in G8 political discussions"""". Of course it doesn't: it would be quite wrong for the President of the Commission to do this since the EU cannot have a single view on these issues, being an association of many countries (some of which are represented in the G8 anyway).

Notability of Jeff Lambert
A tag has been placed on Jeff Lambert requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

"""please research into feminist periodicals on superiority ==

Feminist newspapers and booklets may have reported, quoted, or published well-known feminists as proponents of superiority or supremacy (likelier the former), particularly in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Many such papers had largely local circulation in various locales with some copies arriving nationally and some are available now in microfilm in libraries (at least, Bell & Howell published Herstory: Women's History Collection (microfilm)). Best wishes and thank you very much.   

 please research What Women Wanted, in Stanford Observer 

A specific source on superiority that I don't have is Freedman, Estelle B., What Women Wanted: Varieties of Feminism in Nineteenth-Century America, in The Stanford Observer, Jan., 1978, perhaps pp. 3 & 7 (The Stanford Observer published by Stanford University & since renamed Stanford Magazine or The Stanford Magazine (news.stanford.edu)), which is cited in Offen, Karen, Defining Feminism: A Comparative Historical Approach, in Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, vol. 14, no. 1 (Autumn, 1988), p. 125 n. 12 & 139 n. 43 (pp. 8 & 22, respectively, in PDF viewer software) (JStor or JStor's stable URL, both as accessed Aug. 28, 2010, 2:48p) (author was of Institute for Research on Women and Gender, Stanford Univ.). While Stanford University's library probably has this on hand, it appears to be rather costly to get a copy, and, as far as I know after checking WorldCat.org, no copy is near me. I hope someone has a copy and can edit the Wikipedia article accordingly. It is also very possible that the superiority referred to has nothing to do with women governing whole societies, but perhaps is only about a """"moral"""", biological, or essentialist claim to superiority and not governance. Best wishes and thank you very much.   

 please find critiques of supremacy generally 

Criticisms of the superiority or supremacy position are implicit in most equality claims, but they probably should be articulated. At the moment, I don't think I have them (except for what I've already added to WP plus some to come on matriarchy). Preferred are two kinds: those by feminists (there's probably a passage in an interview of or an article by Betty Friedan, for example) and those by antifeminists (although some likely exaggerate and conflate all of feminism with superiority aspirations and object to the whole, rather than state a specific objection to superiority per se). Best wishes and thank you very much.    (Corrected the syntax of the first sentence to conform to that of the next sentence: )

 whether Les Guérillères community intended as relatively modern 

I think Monique Wittig's Les Guérillères, the 1969 novel, was meant to be relatively modern or futurist, and thus so was the proposed female state. This is suggested by the words """"rifle"""" and """"bullet"""" in the novel (Wittig, Monique, trans. David Le Vay, Les Guérillères (1985, © 1969), op. cit. (cited in the draft), p. 141 (""""rifle"""") & p. 132 (""""bullet"""" & """"bullets"""")), in contrast to an existing interpretation of the fiction as Amazonian, probably meant in a sense other than ancientness. The ages of the English words rifle and bullet, about 2–3 centuries (per Shorter Oxford Eng. Dict. ([4th ed.]), could be irrelevant if her original French words, whatever they were, were old enough and meant ancient weapons or weapon supplies used for war. To avoid this factor being deprecated as original research from a primary source, is there a secondary source about the feminist state's intended time frame other than 1969?

 Wahabi and terrorism 

I have added this heading with neutral and verifiable sources which is most missing point from this Article.

Wahabi relationship with Terrorism
Wahabism,Saudi Arabia’s dominant faith is an austere form of Sunni Islam and Its explosive growth began in the 1970s when Saudi charities started funding Wahabi schools and mosques.[22] Professor Bernard Lewis, a leading scholar of Islam, has noted that the Wahhabis are to Islam what the Ku Klux Klan is to Christianity. They can be accused of hijacking Islam.[23]
The Wahabi movement is directly involved in terrorist activities all over the World.The Al Qaeda and a lot of recent Islamic terrorists such as Osama Bin Laden, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, and Abu Musab Al Zarqawi, have been inspired by Wahabism[24]. The regular Bombing of shrines in Pakistan and Killing of Sunnis and Shias is done by Sipah-e-Sahaba and TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan).[25] Wahabism is associated with the removal of head stones from the graves of the members of the family of the Prophet Muhammed, and the desecration of Islamic shrines in Hejaz and Karbala in Iraq, and the struggle for power in what was yet to become Saudi Arabia. Once its followers took power, they did whatever they could to destroy Ethiopia. For example, the secessionist war in Eritrea (1958-1991), which was designed to make Ethiopia land-locked, was largely financed by Saudi Arabia. Likewise, Saudi finance made it possible for Somalia to invade Ethiopia in 1977- 1978. The Saudi authorities may deny this, but it is widely documented. [26]
[edit]In Pakistan

The JamatudDawah ,Lashkar-e-Jhangvi,Lashkar-e-Taiba and Sipah Sahaba are main terrorist organization of Wahabi movements .These terrorist organizations have been banned by Pakistani government but are working by their new names. Arab states especially Saudi Arabia and GCC states have been funding extremist Deobandi and Wahabis in Pakistan, since the Afghan Jihad.Pakistan has became a battleground between Saudi Arabia funded Deobandi and Wahabis and Iran funded Shia causing deaths of thousands of innocent Muslims.[27],
[edit]In India

Wahhabism, an austere, puritanical interpretation of Islam promoted by Saudi Arabia, is making deep inroads into Kashmir due to the efforts of the Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith, which calls itself a religious and welfare organisation.Kashmir's non-Muslim minority, too, views the Wahhabi ingress as a """"conspiracy to Talibanise Kashmir"""". """"The Taliban had also sprung from Pakistani madrassas funded by the Wahhabis,"""" says former Kashmir University professor Kashi Nath Pandita. [28]

Why has it taken so long for the Russian ship to arrive? Maybe because a)MV Faina isn't Russian and b)it is quite some distance from any Russian port. As far as I am aware none of the equipment on the ship belongs to Russia. The reason for the USA to wait has nothing to do with the origin of the equipment on board but rather simple prudence. Instigating a firefight that is almost certain to cost the lives of many if not all the crew members of the MV Faina where one might not be necessary would be astonishingly stupid. At present the order of the day is containment while negotiations are carried out to secure a peaceful outcome. In any case if the ship were to be boarded it would be done by special operations units who would have been very unlikely to have been aboard the American vessel when the crisis arose. They would need to have been mobilized and transported to the region before any such operation would even be considered.,0
"Well the Americans ignored the UN and went to War with iraq.  the War is still illegal whether Britain and the states want to admit it or not.

So let me get this straight, if Iran tomorrow renames itself 'death to all americans' and most the inhabitants back this name as does lets say another few countries...even if the UN do not recognise it - this site will??? that is hilarious, stop this insanity and give the page the title FYROM, the legal name.  If tomorrow the UN and EU says they recognise the name republic of macedonia, whether it offends all of Greece tough - that should be the name.  But as it stands that has not happened, so why pick sides? The agreed name is FYROM for a reason, if everyone thought Greece did not have a point they would be laughed out of the negotiations, however that is not the case, the UN and EU does not recognise the name Macedonia for a reason, this page does not recognise the UN, cool for America - for the rest of us, an insult to our intelligence.",0

Let's look at the current tagged text, I'll start a subsection for each.   
using computers in 1968
Starting in 1968, Khalifa used computers to analyze the frequency of letters and words in the Qur'an.
1974 claim of numerical pattern
In 1974 he claimed that he discovered an intricate numerical pattern in the text of the Qur'an involving the number 19 mentioned in verse 30 of chapter 74 of the Qur'an.
This may be inaccurate, his original work on numeric pattern did not connect pattern to 30:74, but I'll check. What we may be seeing here is later synthesis.   
Details of claim
The details of this analysis including tables are available in the back of his book, Quran, the Final Testament.[2]
This was not tagged, but needs attention anyway
The details shifted over the years, and what was published in the Final Testament is quite different from the earlier publications. So it is not """"this analysis,"""" i.e., the 1974 analysis.   
Many popular magazines and newspapers
Many popular magazines and newspapers[which?] in the Muslim world reported his discoveries.
This doesn't need two tags. I'll pull the first.  
Other magazine and newspaper articles
Many other magazines and newspaper articles by and about Khalifa appeared throughout the world in many languages.
This is redundant, I'll yank it.   
Many Muslim organizations
Various Muslim organisations however have criticised Dr. Rashad's studies,[citation needed] accusing him of spreading heresy and ignorance through his proclamation of himself as a prophet

About the structure of the article generally, I have a few points:

I think that there should be a section for each daughter section, and that this should pretty much just be a quick rundown of that page, of the important parts in that page.
The 'research into health benefits' should be moved to the third party page, and only one study mentioned briefly on the main pagethe one that appeared in a journal, the other maybe should not be mentioned. Does not warrant a section to itself, at any rate. (will just go ahead and do this now)
Take out epoch times section. It is related to Falun Gong, but it is not of the same nature as the other sections, like beliefs and teachings, falun gong overseas, persecution etc.. There can be some 'related pages' mention of it, I think that would be appropriate, but basically it is not specifically a part of the Falun Gong cycle of articles, though related to them.

Comment about JJ Bulten

Greetings,

I would like to mention that I added 0% of the """"OR"""" tags and thus am innocent. I realize that when someone is trying to find a compromise, it is easier to blame """"both sides"""" for a conflict. However, on closer inspection, I would be willing to bet that a judge or jury would find that I am arguing on the merits of the Wiki-policies and outside sources, while JJB is using scorched-Earth tactics. Please consider this example:

    The evidence does not favor backing off from requesting a move, for compliance's sake, in some other polite way. First, the """"vote"""" remains 6-4 by my count: no consensus. Second, your unsourced statement of thousands of """"longevity myths"""" cites is probably a Google exaggeration based on estimated mirrors; see above where I sourced the real numbers as 92 vs. 91. Third, this exaggeration only reflects the fact that a vast number of """"myth"""" mirrors stem from Ryoung's wholly unsourced 2005 insertions. (The User:Shii/Hoaxes page normally considers this as evidence of hoaxing. See User talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity, ticklish situation for 26 phrases originating from Ryoung that have exactly zero Google support outside his 2005 insertions.)

            Yet another FALSE accusation. There is no """"hoaxing"""" here at all, nor has there been any attempt at """"hoaxing."""" I am not responsible for third-party sites, but if they choose to copy my work, might it be because they consider it a reliable source?Ryoung122 

                Comment: Looking closer, we see that it was JJB that listed this as a """"hoax"""":

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity.2C_ticklish_situation

Citation of one's own accusation is a circular argument, and thus invalid.

In other words, JJBulten first adds material to Shi's page then cites his own add as """"proof"""" of hoaxing. Actually, it's only proof of his fanaticism, of hitting 'below the belt' in an attempt to radically remake this page in his own image. """,0

Er, no. Nice try (I'm being kind) but do you really believe that portraying a £720,000 EU grant for researching new ways of thickening several food products, including yoghurt, as """"£700,000 to stop yoghurt going runny"""" is as much of a misrepresentation as the way you mischaracterised Britain's 1939 declaration of war? No, of course you don't. Frankly, I find it hard to believe that anyone can think of the yoghurt thing (and many other examples) as being any kind of misrepresentation, but the Commission certainly does, else such stories wouldn't be on its many lists of """"myths"""", so I have to assume that you and other Wikipedians are being sincere when you see misrepresentation where I see only (justifiable) disrespect and ingratitude.

So let's start from the bottomthe top. The current article starts with a lot of tosh about urban legendsby stating that """"Euromyths can be either wholly untrue or a deliberate distortion of the facts"""". Truth is unwelcome, as is accidental or ignorant distortion. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, a Euromyth is always a deliberate calumny.

Now, that's certainly the way the word is used by a very large number of people. Trouble is, though, that this very large number of people is ignorant of the facts - the facts as presented by the arch-priests of this very large number of people, to wit the European Commission and its many propaganda outlets. To put it simply, any examination of any official list of Euromyths will throw up at least one Euromyth that is to myth, falsehood and misrepresentation what Plan D was to  democarcy, dialogue and debatenot mythical at all.

So the article is wrong to start as it does. Once you have conceded that, and all this tedious """"urban legend"""" ping-pong has been banished, we can get on with sorting out the rest of it. (I currently see five categories ...)

If anybody can clearly and simply explain ranking methodology, and/or what this """"poll's"""" value may be as objective, fairly presented and relevant information regarding Scott, this could help justify it's inclusion.

I can't quite agree with the philosophy.  I think """"announce on the noticeboards,"""" and then you can talk to people like a normal human with normal conversation on IRC, if you're going to be there anyway.  Fundamentally, though, IRC is not part of Wikipedia: it's part of Freenode.  Wikipedia's rules are suspended there, including keeping a history, open editing, etc.  Therefore, if you announce first on IRC, you have, effectively, not announced at all.  I've tried to avoid taking such a draconian line, but that is the actual line.  In the meantime, knowing that people will say things as soon as they notice them, and, if they're on IRC at the time, they'll say it first there, the biggest thing is that every IRC user needs to know that whatever is said there simply hasn't been said at all, as far as Wikipedia is concerned.
My talk page should be mysterious to anyone who hasn't seen the logs of en.administrators.irc from Christmas Eve.  For myself I will say this much: I don't get actually angry very often, and when I read those logs I was enraged.  That should say something.  No doubt that argument doesn't look helpful, but I'm willing to go through it and look bad, if necessary, to get people to stop sniping from behind a screen.  If they want to denigrate me, want to spend time characterizing """"idiots who complain,"""" then they should do so where they have to be subject to the same """"assume good faith"""" and """"civility"""" and """"no personal attacks"""" rules that they have blocked people for (repeatedly).  
I was working on this essay prior to Christmas Eve.  All that did was turn up the heat and encourage me to focus both on general best practices and the fundamental abuse that is en.administrators.irc.  IRC has some rationale.  The en.administrators.irc has none whatever that I can see.   """,0

(2)  The Quackbuster manipulation of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia: 

Wikipedia is an odd thing.  It is made up of a so-called """"volunteer system.""""  Several years ago, a team of quackbusters infiltrated various levels of the Wikipedia operation, and are now entrenched in the middle, and lower, level volunteer management system.  If you try and put any positive information about advanced medicine, or the problems of US health care, on Wikipedia, or change false or misleading information the quackbusters have installed, you will fail.  You will be blocked from further """"editing"""" and the pages of Wikipedia will now carry information about what a """"terrible person you are.""""  The only way to have ANY influence over what Wikipedia says about  subject is to approach them with a legal threat letter at the highest levels.  Nothing else works.  Even that has problems, for Wikipedia management operates on a financial shoestring, and apparently has no ability to police its own encyclopedia.  Unfortunately, people use the encyclopedia - and they get very bad information about health care.

Below is a paragraph from the editor’s section of Wikipedia.  The editor, here, is discussing the problem of the quackbuster slime, acting to control the information flow on Wikipedia - and what to do about it.  so you understand the abbreviation POV stand for Point of View, and NPOV stands for No Point of View, which Wikipedia wants.  The part in red is for emphasis. Read this:

I guess it depends on what purpose the External Links section serves. Do the links have to serve the NPOV interests of the article or can the links section be a place where specific points-of-view can have a chance to be expressed? As it is now, the chiropractic link section is broken down into Advocacy and Critiques. I think that this warns the researcher that they are leaving the NPOV environment that Wikipedia tries to provide and will be entering a POV external site.

If these links are truly just linking to the page for marketing reasons and don't serve a primary function of adding to the knowledge-base, I would then say to axe them. I haven't checked every critical link, but they do seem to link to essays or research on pages that don't directly try to sell you anything (other than their POV). If they are all offering the same POV with no really distinguishing differences, then they should be reduced in number.

The soapbox point is interesting. These are external links so it would seem that Wikipedia is not being directly exploited as a soapbox. However, the abundance of critical links could be seen as an attempt to present bias... using the amount of negative criticisms to invoke a negative POV about chiropractic. My solution up until now has been to add to the advocacy links to balance out the criticism. You can certainly try to delete the critical links and claim NPOV but I can almost guarantee you that you be quickly (and improperly) accused of """"vandalism"""" by one of three specific chiroskeptics who police the chiropractic page all day long as far as I can tell. They love to throw """"vandalism"""" accusations around - and usually are vastly overstating the matter. That being said, I have suggested a """"disarming"""" strategy, where both sides would remove links in a balanced way, but my suggestion was met with silence.

Now as far as the link farming goes. Yes, virtually all of the critical sites are linked together through the SkepticRing, Anti-Quackery Ring, Chiropractic Subluxated Ring and other ways fashioned specifically for the purpose of boosting Search Engine ranking. A lot of those sites are operated by Stephen Barrett and his buddy Sammy Homola - Chirobase.org, Quackwatch.org, and NCAHF. They're three organizations all saying the same thing. What's really slimy is that they state opinions then reference their sister-sites support to that opinion. A lot of the links are operated or moderated by Fyslee (one of the three chiroskepics users who regularly accuse people of vandalism for removing links to his sites). Check out his userpage to see which sites he operates and moderates for. These chiroskepitics are working together to actively employ search engine tricks such as artifically boosting Google ranking by adding external links to their sites all over Wikipedia. I have documented this. Their goal is for a researcher curious about chiropractic to encounter their anti-chiropractic sites first on a Google search. Given these organizations' objective, I can certainly understand why they would want to do this. Unfortunately, the tactics that they employ are objectionable to both Google and Wikipedia. Hopefully these organizations will get wise to the chiroskeptic ring and ban their sites.

I'm not sure what to do in the meantime. One thing that I would like to suggest is that a website is linked to only once in the external links section. As",0

The tecniques are very simple and there is ample evidence that these are quite ancient and referred to in many practices, books and poems
There is no """"magic"""" or """"grace"""" or """"opening the third eye"""" involved. For the last 8 years the Knowledge has been imparted via a video presentation in which people come and watch an explanation of the techniques presented by the teacher Maharaji.
Four promise are asked before the video presentation is shown (these are made verbally and no legal document signed, students are trusted implicitly.) Give a fair chance to Knowledge, don't reveal the techniques to others and keep in touch with the teachings. 
The whole presentation last 2 1/2 hours.
As there is no group activities ot colective payer sessions or any other type of liturgy, students are free to use these techniques (one hour per day is recommended). There is no cohersion to do anything, beyond the very mild promise """"give a fair chance to the practice.""""

Moreover, in another poll (Rede Globo Mineira, 2000) in the populous State of Minas Gerais, Chico Xavier, the most popular spiritist medium in   Brazil, was elected the Mineiro (Minas's citizen) of the century, competing against other popular celebrities like the former President Juscelino Kubischeck and inventor Santos Dumont.

 Original Research/Other 

The article mentions some details about the combos, as well as character storylines.  Although these things do seem accurate, a lot of material seems to have been written by someone familiar with the game and doesn't cite the source.  Perhaps a simple sentence, like """"The arcade included the following descriptions"""" would be more precise.  Meltdown's name is probably able to be cited from a Nintendo Power.

Winning the game with Eyedol does have an ending storyline that clearly parodies Blanka from Street Fighter II.  Another note is that the SNES version had a different ending (saying something about Eyedol's bracelet) whereas the arcade version mentioned the club.

Some notable game play features: I think the sky stage is perhaps noteworthy, as it could lead to some very short games on the arcade (although the Tekken series was known to have even faster fights).  Also, in the arcade Eyedol had a notably easy infinite combo (when the opponent was at the edge of a stage), plus a much more difficult infinite combo (running back and forth), and the SNES version didn't have these things.

The comment above about tapping a low button might be referring to the easy repeatable combos in KI2, which would be another game.

KI1 and KI2 used the exact same motherboard (the model # / name / whatever was identical on both motherboards), and the software was different only by the chips installed in the motherboard and the hard drive.  (Surprising, perhaps, considering how different the games graphical feels look from each other.)  These games used the Ultra 64 hardware, which was the correct name for the hardware at the time of KI1's release.  Rare had said (in some unofficial strategy guide) that they had no concerns/reason-to-worry about KI Gold matching the performance of KI2, making some smart remark about those concerns only being needed when moving to a less powerful machine.  (KI Gold was initially also going to have more characters, but the memory limitations of the cartridge later proved to prevent this.)  Therefore, it's not out of line to think that the N64 is really significantly different than the Ultra 64, other than the lack of the hard drive.  Cruisin' USA is known to use some other motherboard, and reference the Ultra 64 just as an unrelated advertisement.

Bugs in the game could probably get their own section, including Orchid's attacking after turning into a frog, opponents shrinking with Thunder's combo, Riptor being unable to get a high hitting combo when the Ultra misses, and the fight being able to continue on after Orchid initiates her Ultra (if initiated after hitting the opponent into the air and then backflipping, and having the opponent hit her out of the Ultra).""",0

Your own description of the two sides seems to more clearly get at the problem here. There is nothing in the dictionary (or in the general definition of a capital) that makes recognition a prerequisite for a city being a capital, but there's also nothing in the dictionary saying it isn't. Likewise, there is nothing in the dictionary (or in the general definition of a country) that makes recognition a prequisite for a region being a country, but there's also nothing in the dictionary saying it isn't. Yet, in the latter case, I'm sure most here would agree that without recognition, a country is nothing, and really is not a country at all. Does the same apply to capitals? Well, we have limited situations in which this is even a question, and unfortunately the primary situation is this one, coming in the context of a bitter, and ultimately stupid, conflict. I personally think the same standard does not apply to capitals, as there is something physical (e.g. government institutions, place of residence of the head of state) to denote the capital. But if one operates under the belief that a state (and we all agree Israel is one, right?) can be without a capital, then maybe one can believe that recognition is a pre-requisite for capital status.

I can understand how a well-intentioned Wikipedian would want to remove said article, but I think this is a bit rash.  Do you understand where I'm coming from?  Please see the Daffodil Daniel talk page.  Thank you.  

Hi GroverTheGnome, Here's a suggestion that can help you. Why not write your articles temporarily on your user page (or subpages). They don't have to meet Wikipedia's notability requirements. And when the subject becomes notable you'll be able to rename (""""move"""") them to the titles you want. It's an easy way to get around the requirement for notability. So don't worry, you can still write the article on this subject and have it on Wikipedia, just in a different place. I hope that suggestion helps. Best regards  """,0

Image copyright problem RE: Image:Wilno.PNG

 This image may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Wilno.PNG. The Wikimedia Foundation is very careful about the images included in Wikipedia because of copyright law. We need you to specify two things on the image description page:

"SBVT 
I don't object to your content edit, but you blew away the citation referencing I did on the existing source. That's lazy editing. I spent a great number of hours formatting over 100 citations on that article so that it would have nice complete footnotes, and I don't appreciate having the sweat of my labor turned into an inline URL that might go dead in a month. Please take more care in the future. -  

Lazy editing is removing factual information which you could have sourced in 3 seconds work. I'd say content is considerably more important than formatting a citation prettily. Derex 
 Excuse me, but I spent five minutes formatting that source, including verifying what was in the article. My edit was proper. It brought the claim in line with the source provided. Your edit removed a valid citation, and replaced it with a simple inline link, which works against the interest of the project. A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again. I know, because I had to chase down about a third of the citations in that article over the past couple of weeks. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the work of others, and be a little more careful next time. -  

Excuse me, but I spent 3 seconds finding a source for that, including reading the google synopsis of the very top hit. Please don't remove trivially sourced content from Wikipedia, which works against the interest of the project. My edit removed neither facts nor citations. Pretty formatting is all very nice, but this is an encylopedia. There is nothing at all wrong with adding inline links, as I did, particularly when they support the facts in an article. My edit was proper. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the factual content added by others, and be a little more careful next time. - Derex 
 Not one of my edits removed the source that the anon editor provided. WP:ATT requires that the editor inserting the claim source it properly. The claim did not match the source, so I simply adjusted it during the primary act of adding actual citation information to to URL. According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed. Now you can keep deluding yourself that you are right and I am wrong, but no one is going to buy that line of bullshit. If you continue to undo the improvement of source citations that I am doing, the you and I are going to have a big problem. -",0

About pronunciation and writing of Asiatic lion / Singh in Hindi

It is pronounced and written in Hindi as:  """"Sa"""" with a small """"Ee"""" ki Matra before it, with a point on top suggesting half """"Na"""" and then full """"Ha. 

As in English you cant write the exact word, after English came they wrote the word as """"Singh"""", but Gujaratis in Gujarat write and pronounce it completely different, its a different language. They write it and pronounce it close to """"Sinnh"""", their Sinh means Asiatic Lion too but is not spelled as or written the same as Hindi.

There is also a surname in Mair Rajputs which is Shinh, that is Asiatic Lion too, again it is different word but this is not a middle name, it is the actual surname / family name from Mair Rajputs.

Hope that helps

 The Lede altogether 
First of all, let my say I apologize for what was described as an """"uncivil"""" debate between the user """"Tippx"""" and myself.  I'm willing to work this thing out like mature adults if he is.  But the attitude of """"my way or the high way"""" comes and it's going to go nowhere and probably end the same. 

First of all, I have to say I agree 100% talk with your assessment of """"Currently the lede is too brief to do this job properly, which perhaps gives the impression that mentioning the detainee incident so prominently is giving undue focus to one particular event"""".  That's exactly the impression I got.  I felt Tippx was trying to put too much emphasizes on something controversial partly b/c at the same time, he insisted a couple facts in the Early Life section were """"overwhelmingly positive"""" as he stated. 
But forget the Early Life section for now. 

Lets talk about improving the Lede section because I agree it does need improving. It's just a bunch of short complete sentences. Which is why if you look at my edited version, I combined some to make it flow while also adding in diminutive additional facts but at the same time. I didn't make one fact override the other.  I listed basically the Key things about West's career and that was it. Nothing was more emphasized. And I actually, as you can see, came to agree that West's exit from the military did need to be mentioned but to a certain degree. While that is a Key thing in West's career, it's one of many. I listed he won this past election but also lost his first election; Listed after he retired, the jobs he took up before his first bid for election; And I did it all in chronological order.
Felt it was balanced, cited, and edited well. But ofcourse, the user reverted it and his only explanation was a different one """"sounded better"""".

But off of that, and onto how we can get it right...

First of all, I'll be clear... It's legitimate and cogent, and I'm going to insert back, the fact that former Congressman Josiah Wall was the last black Florida Congressman and also the last EXACT YEAR is substituted for """"In November 2010 he was elected as the first African-American Republican Congressman from Florida since the 1870s."""". It's not that much more lengthy and listing the exact year and the last person, who indeed was the last black Rep from Florida, I feel does no harm and doesn't for a sec take a viewer completely out of the main subject. And also, justified to just say in the """"2010 Mid-term election"""" rather than """"November 2010"""". Everyone knows our elections are in November but when a reader 15 years from now may be reading, the fact it says mid-terms will immediately thwart the curiosity of whether this subject's election triumph was in a Presidential Election year or Mid-Term year.

And it also it's rational to just put he's """"Republican Representative-elect....."""" rather than """" """"He's Representative-elect from Florida....."""" and the """"He is a member of the Republican Party"""". Those can EASILY and rationally be combined. No requisite for deliberation there.

As far as what   and (talk contribs) say about the interrogation incident. Qwurxian, your statement of """"you cannot factually state that it was due to pressure, that it was to preserve his benefits, because he was afraid of being convicted, or any other reason.....""""...... I guess one would feel we need an exact statement from West's mouth as to EXACTLY WHY then OK, I guess find a statement by him saying WHY, but one would assume it was at least two if not all three of what you mentioned by simple coherence. We'll leave that open.

And we'll leave else to be be dealt with. 

And we can figure out how to combine and get the right Lede we're looking for as well as anything else.

  your response to be correctly crticised was to act like a vindictative policeman. punish the man who has justifiably criticism him. that's what you did and that 's bad behaviour.. and you  and wiki rules should take your punishment in being roundly criticised. wiki rules are rubbish and have no place in public forums.

"I am really puzzled by the confusion that remains here. First, people need to know that the term prophet is used in two ways by the LDS. In essence, any individual who is given revelation which is pertinent to the future is acting prophetically. Thus, any individual (in or out of the Church) might prophecy and thereby be referred to as a small-'p' prophet. However, some individuals are formally ordained (by laying on of hands) as Prophets, Seers, and Revelators. Thus, Brother Jones may be a Bishop, a High Priest, an Apostle, and a Prophet at the same time (we actually have 15 prophets if you wish to pursue the issue). Unique to the LDS belief is the understanding that the authority of Priesthood offices are retained, based on worthiness, forever. So while Joseph Smith acted prophetically, he also held the titles of, Elder, Apostle, Prophet, President, and High Priest. It could also be said he was a Deacon, a Teacher, and a Priest. These are titles. In fact, broken down by office and (common usage)

Aaronic (preparatory) Priesthood
Deacon (Brother Jones) 
Teacher (Brother Jones)
Priest (Brother Jones)
Bishop (Bishop Jones)

Melchizidek Priesthood 
Elder (Elder Jones)
Seventy (Elder Jones)
High Priest (Brother Jones)
Patriarch (Formerly Patriarch Jones, new policy recommends Brother Jones) 
Apostle (senior Quorum member designated Prophet, or President Jones)

 

Consider this fact. Joseph Smith's father served for years as the Patriarch of the Church. While he was a patriarch (speaking of his role as a father) it would sound silly to state that Joseph Smith Sr. was the (small 'p') patriarch of the church.

Joseph Smith, while a 'p'rophet, was also a 'P'rophet by virtue of Priesthood office. Thus Pope John Paul, President Obama, Prophet Smith (though the term President Smith is more commonly used). So feel free to refuse to identify Joseph Smith as a 'p'rophet. But it is insensitive to both the RLDS and the LDS and erroneous to ignore the fact Joseph Smith was a 'P'rophet (an office in the High Priesthood). I don't follow the Pope, but I wouldn't deny he is one. You don't have to believe Smith was a prophet, to accept he was a Prophet in the LDS Priesthood.",0

I repeat:  Ward Churchill during his speech at the University of Hawaii admitted that he is NOT an Indian.  The comment, word for word, was published in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Vol. 10, Issue 54Wednesday, February 23, 2005 Churchill attacks essay’s critics by Craig Gima.  I'm going to attempt to be gracious but I have to say that you and  missed the boat on this one.  I'm not going to do it tonight because I do need sleep, but there is going to be huge re-write of the article tomorrow because the article is just flat out wrong now.  These """"allegations"""" of """"fabrications"""" have been provable facts of fabrications.  It calls into questions so many other things about the guy.  What other things is he out and out lying about???  But more importantly the way that the section on his fake Indian heritage needs to be completely re-written.  Considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in Indian Country who dared to question his Indian heritage claims over the years, I think that Indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming.  So many peoplewho do NOT even live in Indian Country, who do NOT work in Indian Countrymade the claim that to dare question the great Ward Churchill's fake Indian heritage was a """"cheap shot.""""  We have been hearing that from non-Indians for many, many years and now Churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over 20 years.  He claims that it merely a misunderstanding created by some sloppy reporters.  That is a damn lie too.  He has been claiming Indian heritage for over 20 years.  It is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books.  He refers to the fake Indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article.  He committed fraud when he applied to the University of Colorado.  The Denver Post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is Indian for affirmation action purposes.  That is a damned lie.  There is going to be re-write and Jodi Rave's comments are going back in and all the rest.  Your attempts to stifle the topic has ended by Churchill himself.- 04:12, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0

1. Why is Dunkleosteus listed under dinosaurs that were apex predators. Dunkleosteus was a placoderm, a fish. It was not a dinosaur!

Come to think of it, why do dinosaurs get their own category instead of being lumped together with the other prehistoric predators, some of which were more closely related to dinosaurs than to other creatures on the same list.
2. As possibly the largest terrestrial mammalian carnivore in history, Andrewsarchus needs to be on this list.

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.

ah, I'm not a woman from Yorkshire. Me mam is, so I have to watch a lot of her stuff. That was the point. Try keep up. As I am not at all a fan I cannot quote endless lines off the top of my bonce, but dinnerladies, for example, I found to be blisteringly unfunny. One example I was forced to view the other night saw one actor do a really long boring monolouge about christmas, the only laugh of which came from the word """"Miss Farnesbarnes"""" - which wasn't even pronounced humorously (like Rowan Atkinson could with """"Bob"""") - and that reminded me of something I saw where Julie Walters got all luvvied up in an interview about how Victoria uses masterful word play. I was left thinking if this is an example of """"masterful wordplay"""" Walters could benefit from watching Blackadder, Chic Murray or anything Eric Idle or Ronnie Barker ever touched. It's a vaugely silly word deliviered by a wooden actor (it was one of those ones she always surounds herself with so they don't steal her limelight)

Then there's one that always sticks in my head for sheer crapness about marks and spencers who's """"trousers are dropping off"""" (i.e. declining in quality/falling down). Now where is the humour in that? It's just a pointless, witless, bottom of the barrel seaside postcard humor that would make Julian Clary cringe. I know bum/trouser jokes are an aquired taste but The Young Ones, French and Saunders, Monty Python, Morecambe and Wise, Tommy Cooper, Les Dawson - they've all managed to construct a well thought through and vaugely witty bum-joke. Simply suggesting that trousers can concieveably fall down by way of an unrelated pun is neither sharp nor funny. 

Finally, my fave, on Parkinson or something like that she told an anecdote about a time she was in a resteraunt and some pissed old lady started saying to her family """"look that's victoria wood! I'm going to go over! I'm going to go over!"""" then she approached Wood and said """"I've come over to see you"""". Now even a comedian with good delivery would have trouble making that one funny, but Wood just sort of stumbled through it. Everyone in my livingroom sat stony faced while Parkie roared with laughter (he deserves the money he earnes) before my Grandad said what everyone was thinking - """"Why's that funny?"""" Even me mam had to admit there was no humour there. I've never been so happy. 

The number of times I've seen Victoria Wood and someone's had to ask """"Why's that funny?"""" Now if you can give me something that is funny by her instead of prasing her as one of the sharpest comics you've ever seen backed up by nothing I'll relent. Until then my original 18 posts stand. """,0

 Corm Capital SPEEDY Deletion 

Dear Darkwind (!),

This page is not unambiguously promotional and definitely does not deserve deletion! The page was NOT created by Corm Capital! That said, reading it and now that it has been created, its purpose is not about promoting Corm Capital but giving a different perspective on the company. Corm Capital is a company with over 1 billion USD in private funds and extremely well established in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA). Furthermore, S&P;/Bloomberg conducted in-depth research on the company, its subsidiaries and senior management before including it in its ultra-selective S&P; Capital IQ database (public link available at http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=238637949). And the list goes on and on...

Bottom line: Corm Capital is a company founded in 1998 with private funds over 1 billion USD and extremely well established in MENA. Having not created this page but having stumbled upon this deletion message, I strongly contest the deletion of this article on the grounds that Corm Capital DESERVES to have a Wikipedia page on it like so many other smaller, less interesting and less established companies that have one. If the content is the problem (I noticed that the description was a taken from our website), PLEASE allow my team some time to arrange it according to Wikipedia's guiding principles.

Also, please note that my grandfather's Wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Corm) has been online for years and has been visited by thousands if not millions of people (my grandfather is in most offline encyclopedias). I personally guard his page when """"incorrect"""" material is inserted in his Wikipedia page so I am well aware of Wikipedia's SPIRIT and GOVERNING PRINCIPLES.

Please trust my sincerity with regards to this deletion matter and please feel free to suggest steps you recommend I/Corm Capital take in order to avoid such an undeserved action (your warning page is impossible to understand!).

I have been a staunch supporter and promoter of Wikipedia for the last 10 years.

Once again, I urge you to remove your deletion of the Corm Capital page to give time to my team to write a """"Wikepdia friendly"""" page.

Kind personal regards,
Charles David Corm""",0

 Jim1138 

Hi.

How did you get involved in this business with ?

Jim1138 left an erroneous and damaging Edit Warring warning on my page.

You can see what he did here. In the 'History' section, he replaced an entirely duplicated section, duplicating the content immediately above it. He called it an """"Unexplained removal of content"""". No content had been removed, it had only been paragraphed ... which he then duplication. 

He was obviously in the wrong. He obviously paid no attention to the content. 

Then he left the erroneous and damaging bad mark which I have asked him politely to apologise, and remove and erase it.

It strikes me it would take a lot less effort just to do so than all this running around.

It is not a """"content issue"""", it was bullying. 

Can you remove and erase it? I don't want it to be left to be used against me, as already happened.

Thank you.   """,0

Third World Comments
I also fail to see how his comments about third world countries belongs in the controversy / criticism section.  Does anyone actually take issue with his claim that they have """"problems of poverty, disease, and corruption?""""  He's basically saying that third world countries are...well...third world countries.

Bin Laden / Ahmadinejad Comments
Gibson isn't accusing Democrats of modeling themselves after Osama or Ahmadinejad, which I admit would be controversial if he did.  He did just the opposite, in fact.  He seems to be accusing the duo of modeling their pronouncements after standard talking points of the Democrats.  This is a far cry from comparing Bush to Hitler, for instance.  

France / Hip Hop Culture and the School Shoooting
His comment saying no one would care if France were nuked might be considered controversial, although it's proven not to be his """"nappy-headed ho's"""" type career damaging statement.  Every section in the criticism section has created NO RIPPLE outside of the highly partisan sections of the blogosphere, aside form his comments on the school shooting (which was mentioned in a small circulation hip-hop magazine).

For the sake of comparission, I'd like to cite Chris Matthew's June 26th edition of """"Hardball"""", where Ann Coulter was a guest.  After saying he was """"deeply concerned"""" about people who think like Coulter, many of the members in the live audience cheered.  This caused Matthews to exclaim, """"My God, is this 'Deliverance'?"""".  I personally criticize Matthews for comparing people to inbred hillbilly homosexual rapists (and not giving them a chance to defend themselves).  Yet, I'm not putting my criticism on Matthew's page.  It's not significant enough to merit mention...just like nearly everything on Gibby's page.  Anyone disagree?""",0

I have posted nothing on the article page as this would presumably be a Conflict of Interest, and have made here suggestions of the way in which the book may be used only because requested - my view remains that it should be done by an editor who does not have COI. I think that now we've moved on from the efforts to exclude a source through (wrong) application of the Notability guidelines we're left with Neutrality of Point of View as the main issue. Wikipedia reports what is out there and a decision to exclude entirely from an article an appropriate source which has a view on much that is in the article (as well as topics the article excludes) appears to be a bias. The idea that the only book of lit crit on Beedle the Bard has nothing whatsoever to add to an encyclopaedia article on the topic is incredible. I don't think COIN is central to the issue as it now stands; rather the central issue is NPV. I think there are wider issues which it would be interesting to discuss - for example had my username not been essentially my real name a post on the talk page a year ago saying """"hi guys, this book exists and has something to say about the article"""" would not have generated this negative discussion. I suggest MedCab is a way forward because it can consider all issues, while COIN considers only one issue and probably one which is not central.   """,0

"""Beating does not necessiarily casue death - maybe the beaten person dies of heart attack, for which he has been susceptible genetically from birth. Still, it seems reasonable to label beating-related deaths like that. A person having beaten and dying soon afterwards reasonably dies related to that. Analogically, a massive cyberbullying case that makes objectively mesurable neurotic symptoms is reasonably related to a death if the death occurs soon or in that context. Of course, the person may have emotional labilities from earlier, but, following the beating and heart attack analogy, I think the """"no direct casue-and-effect"""" argument goes to far.

For Canada and all other Commonwealth Realms (except for England itself), the monarch appoints a governor-general to take over his or her duties in the realms.

He or she stands for stability, democracy and justice. One only point I don't like on monarchies is that in most of present monarchies the husband of a reigning queen becomes Prince Consort instead of King Consort. That should be changed. And now to the USA: the president is not elected by the People, but by electors. Second, there are only two parties, which have real chances to become ruling parties due to the restrictions of the Constitution. And third, it has a first-past-the-post voting system like in England, which also favors the only two ruling parties. In England, it doesn't matter, because Con. Party and Lab.

"There are several issues with the Sageworks article:

 1. Sageworks engages in the questionable practice of gathering protected business data and reselling it for a profit. Given their tricky indemnity clause in the Terms of Use, I sense that they know this and seek to shield themselves against potential legal attacks by irate business owners. This needs to be stated in the article.

 2. The very sensitive data they resell is offered online. They are thus a high value target for cybercriminals. That needs to be stated to make the reader aware of the risks. If Sageworks systems are broken into, the attack will not be made public as they are a private company.

 Removal of images of nudes 

To editor 96.60.28.170... To be honest, you raise a good point; however, it is my opinion that any children who may see these images of classic paintings will not only be enriched by them, but also they will probably not see the """"nasty"""" side that some adults might see.  When I was a child, I saw great beauty is such works of art.  And I also saw great beauty in a Van Gogh, or a Rembrandt or any number of works by great artists.  Sculptures of David, Venus de Milo and other nude or scantily clad subjects are a part of this world.  And I might add they are some of the better parts of this world. 

Since this is an article about """"Truth"""", I would ask you to honestly state your real concerns here.  Are you worried that some child will see these nudes and they will cause him to become a pervert?  Is it your concern that children will be permanently marred by being exposed to nudity?  Children, as you may know, have very short attention spans.  They revel in one fascinating thing after another, rarely staying with one thing for any length of time.  In any case, it is a violation of Wikipedia's Neutral point of view policy, as well as the content preservation policy to remove works of art such as these for no reason other than it is one person's point of view that the nudes should not be viewed by children.  If these images are offensive to you, then by all means use your mouth quickly and click on another article.  There are several other articles related to Truth that can be found in the Navbars near the bottom of the article.  Best of everything to you and yours!

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, """"splash"""", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

 Please reconsider taking a break 

It's not just because of Sapphic's loss of temper that I'm suggesting a break, although it certainly plays a part.  I really think more progress would be made (in arriving at a community decision supported — and enforced — by ArbCom, as well as in getting the injunction lifted) if the named parties all removed themselves from the situation.

As for my comments about your son, I did NOT mean to imply that his trying out to be a SEAL was important to you and nobody else.  If I'd meant that, I'd have written it that way.  I don't like sarcasm or veiled insults, and prefer the more direct variety.  If I'm not writing mean things to you, then you can be sure I'm not thinking mean thoughts about you when I write whatever I do write.  I think in at least that one aspect of things, we have pretty similar views, and I definitely respect you for being able to shrug off insults.

I'm not posting anything to any of the dates-related pages for at least a week, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to convince Sapphic to do the same, and hopefully Locke Cole will follow suit.  You can choose to keep posting, but I don't think you're actually helping your cause by doing so at this point, and you may in fact be hurting it.  Most of the reason I picked the names I did is because we all seem to have a rather... """"wordy"""" ... approach to things, and we're drowning out (and probably scaring off) other people who might want to voice their opinion.

Kung Moggy

Tae Kwon Do is inspired by the conbination of Karate and Judo and practiced by real people, so its history is very similiar to Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do.  Hence it is an actual martial art.

 Moving Teras Kasi from """"Movies and Television"""" to """"Games"""" 

 
Though the game Masters of Teräs Käsi is set in the Star Wars universe, the fighting style exists only in video games, namely Masters as well as Star Wars: Galaxies. It has never been mentioned in the movies, and is not part of the canon. I propose that this entry be moved to the games section.

Teras Kasi is also part of several Star Wars novels written by Steve Perry. So it is not just used in games, it is is also used in several of Steve Parry's star wars novels.

JJL, 23 November 2005
Tai Shing Pek Kwar is a real style of monkey kung fu, not (or in addition to?) a fictional one. It's the style of Paulie Zink. Does it belong here?

On Taejutsu, it was not invented by Seth McFarlane for """"Family Guy"""", although he might have thought so at the time. Taejutsu is actually the name of the unarmed fighting style which is part of Ninjutsu. See any book by Stephen K. Hayes.

Thats Taijutsu, different spelling. Also I second the moving the Teras Kasi thing, never been in or near the movies, and I don't believe that it does have any relation or connection to the the Force, the article on it certainly says nothing about that. Lastly is Fuck You not infact a joke Mike Myers said in So I Married An Axe Murderer, not a fictional martial art from that movie?  

 Miss Ho style 

While drunken boxing is real, the drunken Miss Ho style Wong Fei Hong makes up is not.

Miss Ho is one of the eight drunken immortals of legend, and her movements are part of the Eight Immortals Style, as well as other forms of Drunken Boxing.

Also, wouldn't lightsaber fighting be broken up into the dark side and the light side?
 In fact, it is mentioned in canon resources that there are seven traditional lightsaber fighting styles (or, they are mentioned up through seven), though their exploration is done entirely in non-canon. 

 Naruto 

What about adding the martial arts from Naruto? Tekken Taijutsu (with its swirling leaf attacks and inner gate openings), Jyuken Taijutsu with its Dim Mak-ness, etc.

 CQC 

I've seen references and articles that state that CQC is a real combat system and the MSG3 CQC style is simply a version with a alternative history and modified for gameplay. Not really a fictional MA. Someone should check this out. 

I believe CQC is real only because I saw it on many websites describing it's origin (all are the same), The history channel, and...wikipedia >_> I'll just go ahead and remove CQC from the list. 

""""CQC"""" is an acronym for """"Close Quarters Combat"""". It's just a generic term for armed and unarmed close combat tactics, not a specific art, although there are several military and paramilitary organizations that use it to refer to their hand-to-hand training systems. On the other hand, the thing featured in MGS3 is a specific fictional art, albeit inspired by real-life tactics...

""" and sounding similar to the English word nigger are used without the disparaging connotation the word holds in English. The French cognate , however, commonly used during the colonial period, is similarly considered offensive, whereas  (literally, """"black"""") is the standard word, with the Anglicism black being a common slang term.

Interestingly, in some places these words refer to people with an only slightly darker appearance than those native to Northern Europe, i.e. people who might be said to have a typically Mediterranean, Southern European/Eastern European appearance without any facial or hair-texture characteristics associated with black people. There are also socio-economic reasons behind this as southern Europeans but particularly eastern Europeans are stereotypically deemed more backwards and less well off than their northern European cousins.

Forms ultimately derived from Latin  have been borrowed into various non-Romance languages, and may be used to refer to people without negative connotation; The Hungarian  referred to black Africans without any negative connotations until the 1990s when its meaning changed under English influence. In Latvian, """"nēģeris"""" is still referred to black Africans without any derogatory meaning. The word nigger, typically with the same spelling and more or less similar pronunciation, also appears as a loanword in languages other than English and has the same racist connotations as the English word. In Nazi propaganda, the German compound niggerjazz was used as a derogatory term for jazz music, which Nazi ideology held was a degenerate form of music. In Yiddish, """"shvartzer"""", meaning 'black' is considered offensive while """"neger"""" is the standard word.

Non-human uses
In the past, nigger was sometimes used as a synonym for """"defect"""", deriving from the phrase """"nigger in the woodpile"""", which originally referred to escaping slaves hiding among woodpiles being transported on trains. It came to mean some unseen problem.Definition of nigger in the woodpile For example, the May 1886 issue of Scientific American, page 308 said, """"The consequence of neglect might be that what the workmen call ‘a nigger’ would get into the armature, and burn it so as to destroy its service.""""

The term nigger was used in lumber mills until the mid-point of the 20th century. It refers to a device that turns a log while it is being stripped of its bark. This may be an off-hand reference to the prejudicial use of the word, as until the machine was invented, this was considered a job too dangerous for anyone other than a black man.

Literary uses
Nigger has a long history of controversy in literature. Carl Van Vechten, a white photographer and writer famous as a supporter of the Harlem Renaissance, provoked debate and some protest from the African American community by titling his 1926 novel Nigger Heaven. The controversy centered on the use of the word in the title and fueled the sales of the hit novel. Of the controversy, Langston Hughes wrote:

The poem Little Topsy's SongLittle Topsy's Song: Sung by the Hutchinson family A modern recording. Music by Asa B. Hutchinson(1823–1884), Boston: Oliver Ditson, 1853Little Topsy's Song: Text and Sources Music by Asa Hutchinson and also by Henry Russell (1801–1900) written in about 1845 by Eliza Cook has the first stanza
'Topsy neber was born, / Neber had a moder; / Specks I growed a nigger brat, / Just like any oder.

The famous controversy over Mark Twain's novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), a classic frequently taught in American schools, revolves largely around the novel's 215 uses of the word, often referring to Jim, Huck's raft mate.{{cite web

Before that a couple of suicide bombers killed 72 Barelwies during their Maghrib prayers.  Their fault?  they were celebrating the Prophet Muhammed's birthday which seems a sin punishable by death.  Before that, a couple of suicide bombers blew scores of visitors to the Shrine of Bari Imam who is revered by both Shias and Sunnies.  Their sin?  They were reading holy Quran for the soul of the saint.  In all three incidents the victims were non militants and many were women and children.

The 2008 ratification of The Great Lakes Commission finally commits American and Canadian governments to the geographical definition of the North American Great Lakes as a distinctive political entity.  In fact and operation, the complex cooperative management of The Great Lakes for purposes of trade, border discipline, parks, transportation, hydro-power, water management and environmental protection has been a reality since 1815.   Ethnically and economically, the borders have always been porous.   Politically, the region has more bi-national commonalities than generally supposed.    Much of Ontarian political culture derived from both Anglo-American heritage and the simultaneous influence and threat of American examples.   More importantly, both the American and Canadian sides played analogous roles in the world-economy.   Both sides of the border transformed from peripheries that supplied natural resources; to semi-peripheries that performed middle-man brokerage functions; to core regions, represented by such world cities as Chicago and Toronto, that provided hubs of capital, administration, and management.   History, politics, culture, and ethnic composition, as well as the more obvious economy, technology, and geology, define Ontario and American Great Lakes states as one region.  04:11, 27 January 2009",0

I know the what the official Star Wars databank says, and it can still be left open to interpretation.

No. The lightning burning his tissue theory doesn't make any sense in accordance to the behavior previously exhibited by Force Lightning interacting with the human body.

No. Just because the lightning was deflected doesn't make its effects on the human body any different. Seriously, why do you think his Sith eyes appeared along with the changes?

 I agree with User:Man with two legs that the graph is extremely misleading.  See this quote about (or maybe from?) Edward Tufte:
 Before the development of spreadsheet graphing, the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist-drawn 3-D images with the height of 3-D objects representing the magnitude of the data points.  In these charts, both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points.  The effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude. (Source)
 The image suggests that the Tsar Bomba, which was three or four times more powerful than Castle Bravo, is actually 40 times larger in volume (or ~10x larger in area).  If explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield (not really accurate, but much closer than this chart) the Tsar Bomba mushroom cloud would be 1.5x taller than Castle Bravo and 15x taller than Hiroshima.  Instead, the diagram shows the CB and TB over a thousand times taller.  

 On this scale, one could conclude that since the Hiroshima bombing's mushroom cloud was about four miles high, the Tsar Bomba explosion (3,000x taller) must be larger than the Earth itself.  98.218.195.90  12:41, 6 July 2010",0

 Roman era/Byzantine/Greek colonies/ Illyrian Albanian/edit wars/Epir plz read all my message 

In the dark and solemn days of the wondrous lands, which would later be called the Balkans, there existed two people. 
One, that would later be known as the Greek people, and the other, the men that would form the nation of Albania. For centuries these two cultures would have many periods of cultural exchange and of cultural strife.

Most of scholars and philologists alike contend that the modern Albanian language to be descended from Illyrian.(check the atlas of world in Barnes Noble,see where they put the Albanian languange)

The Illyrian name is understood in the Albanian interpretation of the Illyrians, """"Ilirët.""""

The root in """"Ilirët"""" is """"i lir"""" which simply means, """"FREE."""" Thus, the meaning of """"Ilirët"""" is """"freemen"""" and the meaning of Illyria (long before America came into existence) is """"land of the free."""" 

The first references,that of 1285 cf.Jirecek 1901,1904,Ajeti 1977,1982,occurs not in Albania itself but in Dubrovnik(Ragusa) where a sizeable Albaniancommunity had existed for some time.In the investigation of a robbery in the house of Petro del Volcio of Belena(now Prati),a certain Matthew,son of Mark of Mançe, who appears to have been witness to the crime states:
""""Audivi unam vocem clamantem in monte in lingua Albanesca"""" """" I heara a voice crying in the mountains in the Albanian languange""""
and I sure those who study Albanian history have 4 more importan references.(they should know that)

What is the significance of these references? First and foremost, it is apparent that in the period 1285 to 1322 the Albanian languange was well-established on the southeastern Adriatic coast.

The dating of these refernces,should not however be taken as an indication that Albanian or early forms of it were not spoken in the preceding centuries.If the Albanians,tells us were rural nomads,warlike inhabitants,and if their settlements were more concentrated in the highlands than on the coast,it is quite likely that they were not taken note of, even though they may have costituted at substantial population group. 

Most historians of the Balkans believe the Albanian people are in large part descendants of the ancient Illyrians, who, like other Balkan peoples, were subdivided into tribes and clans. The name Albania is derived from the name of an Illyrian tribe called the Arbër, or Arbëresh, and later Albanoi, that lived near Durrës.Only Albanians preserve the Illyrian names ex; me my name is Taulant-Taulantët illyrians tribes, Genti,Bardhyl,Dori,Boiken,Bato etc etc so the question is How come Albanians are the only one to preserve this names and languange? and NO its not communist propaganda, my greatgrandfather's name was Bardhyl and his dads was Agroni.

The most known Illyrian sign is the snake or dragons rolled or twisted, that Illyrians used in their shields & in their art.Dragons and snakes were worshiped by Illyrians, they still continue to exist until this day in Albanian mythology...

Greek roots with Illyrian its a stupid argument,mixing oil with water,I never heard that Greeks claiming Illyrians.One point its true, some did mix with Greeks, I am sure not everyone was isolated on southern Illyria from the Albanian hardesh geography or imigrated towards Italy.
Greeks have their old history and I don't think they need Illyrians to prove that.
I was the one who started the Greek colonies because they show that we all have a worked together but never thought that it will end up like this, with maps to be used for nationalistic ideas,to claim lands.Epir it was and is to the Albanians,Greeks,Albanian-Greeks,Greeks-Albanian people. We need to show some respect,from those mountaints of north west of Greece (south of Albania) Pyrros, Bubullima,Boçari etc called home.

I don't like nationalist of any kind, its 2008 people,there is thousand of books about Albanians,wake up, but to delete critical points that linked Albanians with Illyrians its wrong,shame on u people, it makes Wikipedia looks bad and it shows that some people still leave in the past.
All these Roman/Byzantine/Greekcolonies articles need to be on one article,they are too long.I would suggest  to help in here,I really do think he is the only (Greek) Wikipedian that can really help and has an open mind.

We know that the shadow of the ancient Greece was too strong/too close for the Illyrian Albanian civilization, but at least try to understand that not everyone who dresses Levis, listens to hip-hop or writes grafitti in English ... is an American........ """,0

The trouble with Mahler analysis is that there isn't a consensus about his compositional thinking.   So, like it or not, comments are going to be subjective, and may well look like """"original research"""".    But it ought to be possible to explain why he thought of this work as a symphony (he deliberately withheld a number from it, because he had a superstition about Ninth Symphonies being terminal: the work we know as his Ninth was in fact his Tenth, and, like Das Lied von der Erde, posthumously premiered).   This article doesn't address that.   It has been suggested that the six movements can actually be seen as covering the traditional four - movements 3 -5 jointly fulfilling the scherzo function and helping to balance the finale.  (One also quotes the Eighth Symphony's second movement).  It might be possible to find in the finale a texture resembling a hybrid of scena and aria (two of each, separated by a funeral march, based on elements of the Trinklied which begins the work, in the role of a development section) and sonata.  The last section of the finale with its repeated """"Ewig"""", could also be seen  both as  a cabaletta and the coda to the whole symphonic conception.   So the intellectual and formal weight distribution of the classical symphony is completely reversed.  But we still have something which can be called a symphony, even though nothing more different from its immediate predecessor, the Eighth, could be imagined.   I'm not proposing this as an addition to the article, simply suggesting that it wouldn't be too hard to find similar thinking in the literature.94.192.68.44    Croy379""",0

Thank you for responding. When a crime has been committed, the last thing you want is for the perpetrators to benefit from the crime. The most important action to be taken is that of restoring the damage that was done through the use of illegal activity. In a civil society, concerns of punishment are secondary to that of fixing the problem.

In this case, User:Chaosfeary has been punished with a 72 hour block that could become indefinite, but the damage he did has not been reversed. By punishing the user while allowing the crime to continue, we are telling editors that they can ignore the rules at Wikipedia in any heavy handed way they want and that, even if they are caught, the results of their criminal activity will remain.

In this case, we can undo the damage simply by restoring the """"American terrorism"""" article. The article needs a great deal of work, of which I am happy to oblige, but the term """"American terrorism"""" definitely exists in usage and has nothing to do with the made-up """"umbrella term"""" """"Terrorism by the United States of America""""

You are nuts, there is a lot of freedom of speech in the US and you abide to that.
You can't just make a law that will prevail over the US constitution. Unless you are willing to rewrite the bill of rights, for that we have to kill Dr MLK jr. again.

No freedom of speech on wikipedia, and i am sure our fathers have fainted back there in Philadelphia after that statement.

His intrusion in our territory shall not be tolerated, he can do as he pleases in his country but in ours, he just can't.

 Copying 

Look, the music is a re-write of the old tune. Its not a copy but its not original.  They covered """"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"""" but with new lyrics. Just having new lyrics does not mean the music is not copied. If not a cover,its close to a cover. A re-arrangement.

This is nothing  as trivial as  """"Ice Ice Baby"""". If """"Ice Ice Baby"""" caused controversy about attribution of the music (It was only 5 notes and the 4th and 5th were slightly different !) then Candy Man should also attribute music to the authors of Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy's music.

 Hari and other parts with sources not cited 

To attribute quotes to Steyn or Hari without citing sources is against Wikipedia policy. You should reference with links (or due diligence references including where and date it was published, volume and page number) what quotes are attributed to Hari or Steyn. Erroneous quotes attributed to a person, not backed up by references, could be interpreted as libelous, and should be avoided. http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/61063/
Large quotes attributed to Hari will be deleted as this is a post about Steyn, not about any single critic. 

The following was deleted:

According to Hari, in November 2001, Steyn circulated a series of conspiracy theories that a huge number of Muslims in New York City had been forwarned of the terror attacks. A Muslim student at a Brooklyn high school, he claims, said to his teacher on 6 September 2001: """"See those two buildings? They won't be standing there next week."""" 

On 10 September 2001, Steyn further claimed, """"a sixth-grade 
[NOTE: HOW COULD STEYN HAVE CLAIMED THIS ON 10 SEPT 2001? THIS STATEMENT MUST BE TOTALLY FALSE.]
student of Middle Eastern origin at a Jersey City school warned his teacher to stay away from Lower Manhattan because """"something bad was going to happen"""". Teachers at schools within sight of the World Trade Center in New York reported that, as the towers burned, many Muslim students were taking pictures: it seemed odd that so many of them happened to have brought their cameras to school on that particular day.""""

Hari commented: 

""""Almost no evidence has been offered in support of [this] claim. Steyn cites only the """"evidence"""" of a disgraced and sacked journalist on a suburban New York paper, and even that is for just one of several """"facts"""" that he cites. [...] Steyn seems to believe seriously that many American Muslims knew about the plan and did not warn anybody - not even the 300-plus Muslims who were murdered in the attack... """"

Steyn himself wrote:

In The River War (1899), Winston Churchill's account of the Sudanese campaign, there's a memorable passage which I reproduce here while I'm still able to: 
""""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - either as a child, a wife, or a concubine - must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.

""""Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen: all know how to die. But the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytising faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science - the science against which it had vainly struggled - the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.""""

Is that grossly offensive to Muslims? Almost certainly. Is it also a rather shrewd and pertinent analysis by one of Britain's most eminent leaders? I think so.""",0

"I don't claim. I write according to what scholarship says. If you don't understand the problem, it's because there is no problem.  Both comments above are pointless except to underline an unfamiliarity with the distinction between ancient texts and secondary scholarship. Let me illustrate by using your claim of a contradiction and restating what I said re Moses, as if it dealt with Odysseus, another fictional person.
'Odysseus is a fictional character invented by Homer and Homer's Odyssey is not a source for explaining the etymology of the name.'
No one would blink at that, except . . .
Just as 'Moses/mashah' is a kind of figura etymologica used by the writers to explain a name whose origins they did not know, so too is 'Odysseus/odussamemos'(Ὀδυσεὺς/ὀδυσσάμενος at Od.xix.406ff.).  This is very frequent in ancient literature. Just as modern scholarship doesn't accept the  Biblical etymology for Moses, so classical scholarship has generally disabused itself of the idea, stated by Autolykos, that Odysseus be named  'child of hate/woe' because his grandfather was in wrathful odds with the world.
γαμβρὸς ἐμὸς θυγάτηρ τε, τίθεσθ᾽ ὄνομ᾽ ὅττι κεν εἴπω: 
πολλοῖσιν γὰρ ἐγώ γε  τόδ᾽ ἱκάνω,
ἀνδράσιν ἠδὲ γυναιξὶν ἀνὰ χθόνα πουλυβότειραν:
τῷ δ᾽  ὄνομ᾽ ἔστω ἐπώνυμον:

The ancient Jewish readers of the Bible were quite aware, as we can see from Philo of Alexandria and Josephus, who both proposed an Egyptian etymology. In doing so, they dismissed the folk etymology given in the Tanakh, realizing that that the derivation from the verb 'to draw from' was an infra-Hebrew folk etymology, a kind of Figura etymologica as ancient rhetoric classified such games, that had no value. How could an Egyptian-speaking princess in 1,500 BC be sufficiently fluent in a language that was only attested in that form several hundred years alter, to give Moses a name that would make sense a millennium later? In medieval times, once direct and living contact with antiquity was lost, all sorts of fantastic speculations developed.",0
"David Shankbone is traumatizing notable authors 

David Shankbone's attitude toward authors who don't like the photos he's taken of them is bossy and bullying.  He takes disastrous photos of authors.  Taking more unflattering photos could hardly be possible (See Edmund White, A.M. Homes, Francine Prose, Kathryn Harrison, Mary Gaitskill).  It's gotten to the point that authors he hasn't assaulted yet with his camera are afraid to go to readings for fear he'll be there, waiting for them.   I don't spend much time on Wikipedia, but when I come upon an author's page with a terrible photo, I now know it's been taken by David Shankbone.  I became curious about how these authors felt about the photos he'd taken of them, so I went and looked back in the history of a couple of them.  First I checked in the history of A.M. Homes, and sure enough, someone tried to take down the Shankbone photo (possibly even A.M. Homes herself or someone close to her), saying it was not a good photo, and he repeatedly put it back.  I also looked in the history of Sharyn November, and she herself had an exchange with him on one of their talk pages saying she preferred another photo of herself instead, but he would not let her have her way, and I don't remember the details, but his attitude was unpleasant and bossy.  She quickly backed down sweetly. 

A few days ago I came upon yet another disastrous author photo by David Shankbone and decided to Google his name, because I've been thinking that sooner or later an article will inevitably come out in the print media about authors' frustrations with this offensive photographer.  I wanted to see if any articles had been published yet about it.  I didn't dig very deeply but did find that on February 18th, 2008, lots of Wikipedia editors wrote about their frustrations with David Shankbone (in a section called: Does Wikipedia want David Shankbone or should we just tell him to leave?), to the point that he promised he'd leave Wikipedia (he shouldn't make promises he won't keep-he didn't even leave for one day, as far as I can see from his list of contributions).   All those posts from upset people have been deleted from Wikipedia, but I was able to find them by going into the history of the page: Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents.  

Authors are not the only celebrities Shankbone has upset.  I came upon discussions (on Wikipedia) about the actor Mike Farrell, who was upset by the photo Shankbone took of him, but Shankbone insisted his photo stay up on Farrell's page (it has now been replaced by a much better photo taken by someone else).  And I'm sure it's happened to countless other “notables”.  Many notable authors who are distressed by their photo will just remain quiet and try not to look at their Wikipedia pages, either because they don't know how to take down photos and post messages on Wikipedia, or because they fear that fighting David Shankbone will be futile and will  only increase their distress.  
Authors are often shy and insecure about their physical appearance.  Why make it worse?  And why be stubborn and nasty about it to the few authors who do muster up the courage to request that an unflattering photo be taken down? 

As with any contributor to Wikipedia, David Shankbone should have no right to assert that his photos take precedence over the photos of others, especially when more appropriate pictures are available and copyright free.  He claims that he has allowed better pictures to take the place of his, but this is clearly not true in many instances, given the way he fights to retain his pictures even in instances when any reasonable third party observer would agree that another picture is either better or more appropriate for the article.  

David Shankbone might be using Wikipedia to try and make a career for himself, and maybe that's okay, but he's hurting a lot of people along the way.  

I am an author, with a few published books, and there is a page on me on Wikipedia.  That's why I care about this issue.   I'm appalled at what David Shankbone is doing to authors.  

As I don't know the best place to post this message, I'm posting it in three places: David Shankbone's talk page, Jimbo Wales' talk page, and Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents.",0

I didn't only cite the scriptures but also other sources that purports to tell what is the real story behind the origin of Gadhimai Festival (I didn't claim it as the sole truth either but it provided a food for thought). If, according to you that is original research, then everything is original research, won't you say? If not in the gadhimai festival article then where should we give a chance to Hinduism as a religion of non-violence? The article attributes all the animal killings of the festival to Hinduism. Isn't that a sufficient ground to shed light on the religion's actual position. Besides, the animal killings of the festival are associated to Hinduism but based on what? Isn't that an original research or a subject of personal opinion too? Thank you I await your reply.  (Talk?)

Beijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on July 13, 2001, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by an absolute majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.

 More on Protocols/Procedures/Courtesy 

Hi Bov,
Thanks so much for your kind reply. Our discussion was getting so long it was unwieldy to scroll though, so I thought I'd continue under a new heading. Hope you have no objection.
I'm still under the gun with that project I mentioned and am amazed that my last note was as long as it is!! Wanted to reply to a few points for the moment...I'm using numbered points because it makes it easier for you (and me) to refer back to.
1. Regardingn my making a clear distinction between me/us and """"your editorial colleagues"""", yes, you're right. I guess I don't know enough about WikiP yet, but I clearly don't have access to the same """"additional facilities"""" (which I take to mean """"tools"""") as you, so I don't have the same control.
Sure, I could put a Copyvio on someone's page, but I rather doubt it would stay there any more than my {db}s did  I assume Copyvio notices are either 1. sent to all admins (or those who deal with Copyvios specifically), and/or 2. posted to the Copyvio page for you and your colleagues to make some sort of determination on. From what you say above, it appears that some Uber Admin(s) makes the final determination.
2. Also regarding """"tools"""" I and, I suspect, most WikiP contributors have no power to Lock and page to insure it doesn't get Reverted by anyone else. Nor can we Delete a page, even our own. Nor do we have access, as I assume you do, to EB and other pay services to check for likely infringements.
There are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers, theses, etc. Perhaps you also have access to those? You didn't indicate how that EB page was accessed since the public can only get the """"teaser"""" entry for Crapsey.
Thus, to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom: """"we are all peers, with equal power to edit, but some of us are more equal than others!""""
3. Regarding your statement that it's """"actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment,"""" are you saying that once a Copyvio is pointed out, the """"offending contributor"""" simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection?!! That's truly astouonding  I'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others, however similiar the contents might be.
Have no idea what you mean by """"the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page."""" Can you point me to a sample of this?
4. Regarding your statement that """"he EB page I'm referring to is , the one originally referenced  what do you mean? Referenced by whom? By your colleague?
Or are you obliquely saying that WikiP has the means of reading contributor hard drive caches and Recent URL lists to determine where they've been?! I know I didn't reference EB and don't know how you access their pay service, but if you're in fact suggesting that WikiP can somehow monitor member hard drives, I'd find that VERY disturbing...an outright privacy violation. Will run AdAware & Spybot S&D; just to see if anything they regard as """"malicious"""" turns up with WikiP fingerprints on it! ;-) 
5. On your reply to 3 above that """"Wikipedia does not, in general, use text 'with permission,' """" I'm confused. The passage I quoted suggests that the authors are granting WikiP a GFDL """"license,"""" which, from my understanding of the law, means """"with permission."""" The author still """"owns"""" the material and, presumably can make whatever other use s/he wants of it but cannot expect payment from WikiP, restrict the editing of, or, for that matter, even withdraw permission for work submitted to WikiP.
6. Regarding your answer to 5 above that you """"don't have access to any special posting info. It's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use,"""" this sort of relates to my #1 immediately above, and I guess I'm confused again. How in the world would Admins and other """"watchers"""" like you (still don't know what your title is) know """"what's new"""" on WikiP if you don't get notices or have some list you can comb through? Are you saying there's an actual public list of all new articles? If so, where is it, and what prompts you folks to check one article vs. another?
Again, thanks. Will try and get back later or tomorrow.

1. Gene_poole, it is not MY pet project - as stated clearly more than once above. That's one more proof you don't read thoroughly what people write - and similarly, you don't check thoroughly things which you delete. Thus, I'm not convinced you can give any actual evidence there's an explainable reason for deleting it. The quote I provided in the initial letter here is a quote from the creator of this project. He said his opinion about you clearly. Not that he cares about any Wiki trolls, Mr know-it-alls and control freaks. The fact that he doesn't even bother wasting his nerves on this discussion here is eloquent enough. But I do care when I see injustice. Not that my """"little rant"""" would change anything. But am I someone who remains silence? I could at least make my """"various pronouncements"""" when I saw injustice. Wikipedia at least allows this, doesn't it? As for the proofs, links and evidence you requested, I shall commit my efforts to collecting them with the guidance from the original creator of the Alphistia project, and present them to you here. After that, it is up to you, to show whether justice really exists in Wikipedia or it is really subject to control by self-authorised junkies as my impression has always told me.

2. I understand the rules of Wikipedia and its standards for verifiability. But I can name you at least a dozen Wiki entries which don't have verifiable source either, save some crafted websites linked to them (that's not a reliable source, anyone can put up a website about anything) - and they still remain. Moreover, I cannot see how you made the conclusion that Alphistia was """"made up in school in one day"""" by reading """"my webpage"""". And, aren't most other invented utopian micronations created in exactly the same circumstances? Isn't this exactly what it's all about? It's not about existing micronations.

3. """"Wikipedia places a high value on verifiable reliable sources"""" - that's pretty ridiculous, as far as anyone's invented micronation is concerned. Invented projects like this do not exist - that's the main idea of utopia. What a material proof do you require? This project has been around the place for many years, and has been presented in internet space for quite a long time - and in more than one place (it has its own website, its own LiveJournal blog and a network of fans and devotees who have developed a community and have even started learning the invented language of the micronation in question) - but all this remained out of your sight as you were deleting it at random, without even checking anything about it. My only conclusion: it made you jealous, and abusing the powers that Wikipedia gives you, you did not hesitate for a minute to do what you've always done (yes, I've been following your epics over here for some time).

4. """"Do you have press coverage, books, real-world items proving it's been an active, well known project?"""" - if you had made the smallest of researches, you'd have found out that this project has participated on a number of exhibitions (the latest one, in Germany) and has picked up some awards among other such invented micronation projects. As for real-world items, the only ones for now are postal stamps issued in recent years - that's something I doubt most of the projects on this list can pride of.

In conclusion, I think this discussion remains pointless until the moment when I provide the above """"proofs and evidence"""" requested. Then, I'll be looking forward to your response.

As for the statement about Wikipedia pronounced in the above Letter, I believe things will change some day here too, though this looks rather unlikely at present. One day, guys like you will be stripped off their undeserved powers. Because the idea behind Wikipedia is too utopian itself - complete freedom brings anarchy. But I admire its democratic principle - everyone has equal rights to express their opinions without being deleted or edited by someone else to whom they don't sound suitable. As for the Truth, the Facts (what is """"notable"""" enough), the Truth is only what the more powerful present it to be.

There seems to be some general confusion about the pronunciation of the Roosevelts' name, even within the FDR article.  I've tried to find a few reliable sources for this info.

M-W gives:
Main Entry:
    Roo·se·velt
Pronunciation:
    \ˈrō-zə-vəlt (Roosevelts' usual pron.), -ˌvelt also ˈrü-\
Dictionary.com gives:
Roo·se·velt  /ˈroʊzəˌvɛlt, -vəlt, ˈroʊzvɛlt, -vəlt; spelling pron. ˈruzəˌvɛlt/
Inogolo gives this about Teddy's name:
Name: Roosevelt  Phonetic Pronunciation: ROAZ-uh-velt
Notes: There has been much debate about the correct pronunciation of Roosevelt's last name, however, in several letters Theodore Roosevelt himself specifies the correct pronunciation. In a letter to the Rev. William W. Moir dated October 10, 1898 he writes:
As for my name, it is pronounced as if it was spelled """"Rosavelt."""" That is in three syllables. The first syllable as if it was """"Rose.""""
Note that none of these sources make a distinction between Teddy and FDR, despite the claims of some that they preferred different pronunciations.  At the very least, each article should be internally consistent.  For Teddy, it seems to be clear that it's /ˈɹoʊzəvɛlt/.  His statement above makes that pretty clear.  FDR's case doesn't seem to be as unequivocal, but the same pronunciation seems to be the preferred one in most media.  The most common variant seems to be the barely noticeably different /ˈɹoʊzəvəlt/.  Most seem to cite the preferred pronunciation of the name being three syllables, not two.

Australia-Italy 15-0
Don't worry... I surely complain also about the Italians! Not to speak about the easy target, our overlord Silvio Berlusconi, give a check to nice guys such as Umberto Bossi... and his electors are around me now I lived in northern Italy! Brr... chills of disgust.  Even Piedmont (I am in Turin now) which was traditionally leftish, now has a total Northern League jerk as governor. To put it on the fun side, maybe I'm especially angry against you Commonwealth guys since Australia again washed us out yesterday in rugby! So for me being polite, or the grocery man, wait till we'll be beating Australia or New Zealand! Joking! Seriously, I really admire Anglophone and Nordic civilizations, and I honestly think you (and Australia in particular) are far better than us in 90% of life things (and 90% of what remains comes from our past). Again honestly, in the matter I got disappointed since I always had a very big picture of Times and British journalists in general (while 90% of Italian ones are renowned to be just serfs of they payers), but for once I understood that journalist made a big mess and did not study in depth the matter. Ciaoooo!! Hugs from Attilio.

Yes and no. Yes because, well, it's a technical decision made by the developers; they change the config files at the direction of their bosses, the userrights change. In theory, it is a decision we could make without consulting the community. In practise - look, I've been an editor for 6+ years now, most of those as just an editor (I've been contracted here for, I think, 9 months and change). I know how silly a decision that'd be, both for practical reasons (people would get totally up in arms about it, and for good reason) and ethical ones (we owe a duty to involve editors in decisionmaking wherever we can, because we're a bottom-up organisation, not a top-down one). So generally speaking, I think editors should be able to disagree and I think editors should at least be asked their opinion before a change is made. That's what I believe, and that's why I held that RfC.
That's also why arguing with me is likely to be futile ). Not because this is a WMF decision, not because this is my staff account, but because we asked people what they want and they said """"give this to rollbackers too"""". I believe this was a perfectly valid expression of the community's opinion on the subject, and that it's much more applicable than the 2008 RfC, which was held when the community was in a much different state, addressing an (in some respects) radically different question, and not explicitly prohibiting these actions. So I'm not going to be persuaded by appeals to that, and it's not me you should be looking to persuade - if you want the situation to change, as said, hold your own. If you don't want to do that, I'm stuck in a situation, hired as a person to ensure the community was listened to, where the only way out is to ignore the opinions of those editors who spoke up when presented with the opportunity. And I'm not going to do that.   13:59""",0

Also, the """"fact that the cattle chose the location"""" of Cattle Chosen is stretching the truth somewhat.  John Garrett Bussell chose the location after thoroughly exploring the area.

They assumed the cow was lost forever, but it turned up at their new location shortly after they did.    The point of the name was that the cow had wandered off because the feed at their old location was poor, and had ended up at their new location because the feed was better.  | Talk """,0

 death 

I think there are various explanations on how chinggis died in the different sources. Some say he fell from a horse, others allege a connection to a XiXia princess, one(?) goes into detail and sais that this princess severed the small Genghis. I think incorporating this into the article would be better than leaving it at the current """"unknown reasons"""". I'll try to find the exact citations until tomorrow. Heissig's Ein Volk sucht seine Geschichte should be OK, I assume?   

 Spelling of name 

The article says:

""""Genghis"""" as popularly spelled and pronounced in Western media and text is supposedly derived from the original Persian reports of an invading army, led by a man in 1219 against the Khwarezmid Empire. The Persian people pronounced the man's name """"Genghis"""", as there was no """"ch"""" sound in the Persian tongue. Henceforth, the Persian version of the name of the leader of the Mongol Empire became known and widespread in the Western hemisphere as """"Genghis"""".[citation needed]

This is absolute nonsense.  There is a """"ch"""" sound in Persian (e.g. chahar, four).  The spelling """"Genghis"""" is more likely to have come from Marco Polo attempting to render the sound of Chinese.  It might be worth pointing out that, in that case, the initial G should be pronounced j or zh, and not like """"get"""" as so many people do.   

Do we have a source either way? If not, then this kind of speculation is Original Research, and needs to be removed (that's why there is a [citation needed] there in the first place).   

I've found a review that attributes the Genghis/Persian theory to Weatherford, and also refutes it based on historical documents. Therefore I've fixed the text in the article to explain that disagreement and pointing to the relevant source.   

Genghis is not Western but the English, French and Spanish spelling, note it's written and pronounced with a """"ch"""" [ʧ] in Russian (Ч),  Mongolian (Ч), Tartar (Ç) and also German (Dsch-). The English spelling should follow the Russian, Mongolian and Tartar for this word, IMO.   

German pronounciation is actually more like Jingis, with J as in Jungle.   

The English name is and remains Genghis. It is not up to Wikipedia to decide whether it """"should"""" be or follow anything different.   

Above statement is wrong. Genghis is almost never used in newly published (scholarly) books and articles in English these days. Most common spelling is Chingiz. Chingis also used. Genghis is now reserved for childrens' books and journalists, Wikipedia should change to reflect this.

I have never seen anyone use Chingiz. Chinggis, Činggis etc. yes, but not Chingiz.   

Looked at some sources and I was wrong above - Chinggis is most common, followed by Chingis and Chingiz in roughly equal second place. No matter how commonly Genghis is used in English, there's no escaping that it's wrong. 212.135.195.50

The bottom line/Recapitulation
Hi. I believe you used your administrator rights improperly since you accused me of multiple things. I consider the content of the block message very offensive and untrue since the edit war technically didn't occur (one false accusation) then calling non-abusive ad hominem reactions as """"offensive personal attacks""""/""""harassment"""" (second false accusation). I realistically admit that policies of Wikipedia sometimes can be bureaucratically absurd (like for example using specific descriptive words for  a young person will result in prohibition from contributing to Wikipedia, since everything even AGF responses are considered as extreme personal attacks), therefore we won't discuss the latter issue. 
Multiple references, like this one, supports my Kylie Minogue's revert and the user Nickyp88 is notified now to not revert other people's edits over personal OR claims such as """"Nu-disco. No. Disco, Nu-disco is different than disco"""". But you clearly didn't want to hear my opinion and probably just let the AN/I """"plebs"""" decide my """"destiny"""".

"Nephilim deleted edit 

You state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).
This aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. 
The next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. 
Here is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.
The next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.
This again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?
You may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.
Once before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.
The reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it.

"""===Contemperary Quebec nationalism contains far too much POV===
First of all """"Anglophone Canadian nationalism""""? I think most Francophones outside of Quebec share the same Canadian nationalistic sentiment and there are still (believe it or not) many Francophones in Quebec who see themselves as being Canadian! So I do not think that Canadian Nationalism should be described as being strictly """"Anglophone"""", because it is not. 

Also when it came to the argument of Quebec nationalism being ethnic oriented as opposed to territorial I felt that again far too much POV dominated the presented thesis. The fact that study after study has shown that the vast majority of non-Francophones in Quebec, groups whose roots in the province go back just as far as the Francophones do not see themselves as being part of a Quebecois nation was ignored. So I made reference to it of course.

 Editor review 

Hey Nish, I'm currently up for Editor Review. I would be most appreciative if you could comment on my Wikipedia habits there and offer some advice. Thanks in advance.  

Thanks for the Editor Review. I honestly, truely know that I do not want to become a Wikipedia Admin. However, I hold the same thoughts towards Wikipedia as I do towards the US military: Given the choice, I would never join up, but my personal philosophy of national service (I agree with the idea of mandatory national service of some sort, whether it be community service or military) compels me so that I plan to join the US military in some form in the future. 

The problem I currently face with Wikipedia is that I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle in both the preservation of information and the adding of new information to Wikipedia. Often, something that I hope to be small edit becomes a huge issue due to vandalism, edit wars, extremely overly burecratic Wikipedians (example: those who like to delete almost every image from topics under the fair use policy), etc. I don't want to end up like many of the former Admins who came to Wikipedia to add information and stayed because they became Admins and spent all their time putting out fires. However, as Wikipedia will experience exponential growth within the next decade (it will plateau when the Internet finally reaches into the third world in a big way), and with that growth will come a huge number of vandals. Honestly, I believe Wikipedia now can use 10x the number of Admins. I can't even imagine how bad it might get on here (with vandals) in a decade or so when the number of Admins has grown at a steady pace but the number of vandals is huge due to the rapid growth of Wikipedia and the Internet in general.

I would prefer to not be an Admin, but I'm willing to put up with whatever it takes to preserve the good info of Wikipedia while ensuring that new info can be added properly.

Any thoughts on this?  

EDIT: Also, I'd like to expand my Vandal Fighting activities, but I'm not sure if I should get external programs like VandalProof. I do patrol newpages every now and then, and in the process catch many vandals. However, I usually cannot punish these vandals because of the WP:AGF policy and the fact that warnings really do nothing to repeat vandals.  

I'll try my best.

You left this comment on my talk page:
Umm...you stated that you shortened the intro here as per WP:LEAD. We were discussing the intro on the talk page, and I would have appreciated it if you would go back and discuss the intro's status on the talk page. I am restoring back the intro section, and you can make minor changes if you wish, but please don't make drastic changes without discussing. Thanks. By the way, keep up the great work with the article. =) Hopefully we can pull this to GA or FA in the near future. Best, Nishkid64 
I've discussed the article on the talk page: The introduction is way too rambling and detailed which is why I shortened it. Please read WP:LEAD which recommends it is concise. Also some of the sentences don't flow well. The first sentence was a Russian Security Service agent [with a link to FSB] and later a Russian dissident is a much better summary than was an ex-FSB lieutenant-colonel with KGB experience in fighting organized crime. Tom .  In order for the article to have more impact it needs to be more concise.  You restored back the intro' i.e. a major change and said I could make 'minor' changes if I wish but 'had to discuss drastic ones', I hope you realise this is hypocritical, given that you did a major revert without discussing.  As you know, several people on the talk page have suggested to you that the intro was too long.  I promise you, the shortened introduction looks and reads better than the longer one.  The longer one does not summarise what he was in the first sentence including his dissidence, it goes straight into a narrative without any gap: """"After working in..."""", it doesn't make sense in English,""""his superiors had ordered for the assassination"""" should be """"his superiors had ordered the assassination"""".  You can't be a dissident of an organisation, see dissident.  It's got several long contiguous paragraphs instead of 4 short clearly defined ones. Anyway, hope you're okay, give us a shout and we can talk about it.

 TTP: """"They are not affiliated with the Afghan Taliban of Mullah Omar who are supported by the Pakistani army and state."""" 

Hi, while I agree for the most part with the above statement, I have to take issue with a little bit of the wording, as petty as that may seem.  I believe that stating that the two groups have no """"direct"""" affiliation would be clearer.  Reference #6 indicates that at some level they do have some sort of affiliation although they are both independent of one another.

Also, the source cited regarding Pakistani support for the Afghan Taliban only alludes to incidents prior to the US invasion of Afghanistan.  However, Reference #6 (from 2009) does indicate more current coordination between elements within the ISI and the Afghan Taliban.  I am going to modify the statement slightly to reflect these two points.

 US emissions description is totally contentless now. 

The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

 On the goodness of description and evil of prescription 

The article on grammar suggests in many ways that teaching people how to listen and read is good, but teaching them how to speak and write is wicked. Linguists are said to be concerned """"normally"""" with the former, implying that there is something abnormal about the latter. The notion that we are all culpable when helping people decide how to communicate, when seeking such help, and when making such decisions ourselves, is not only perverse and deplorable, but also patently wrong. We begin our lives incapable of speech. Is it wrong to acquire the ability? Is it right to call instruction in the application of the rules of grammar an invalid activity? Banning prescriptive grammar from the general article on grammar and suggesting that it is illegitimate are serious mistakes, motivated, I suspect, by timidity, laziness, irresponsibility, and ignorance. Only a stubborn, intentional, dedicated ignorance can maintain that proficiency in English composition must not be taught, nor properly called """"grammar"""".  """,0

Stop interfering in issues you do not understand. You also failed to understand that the 300,000 figure give by Federation of Cypriots refers to people it represents.

 Found more usage of the term """"black sheep."""" Depending on the group culture using the phrase, it was either positive or negative, so further clarified usage by splitting the term into two groupings with citations and examples for each.  I know Baa Baa Black Sheep was removed once.  However, it is an example of the use of the term.  The other examples should be obvious.  If not how do I clarify.

Speedy deletion of The Wrong Trousers (Band)
 A tag has been placed on The Wrong Trousers (Band) requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

To be honest I have some issues with your edits. I answered you question above and fixed your error in the introduction of the article. 

There are two methods to define the topology of a LCTVS space: using a family of seminorms and using a local basis of locally convex, balanced and absorbend sets. Both methods should be present in the article on equal terms. The family of seminorms is useful to view LCTVS as generalizations of normed vector spaces. The definition in terms of a local base is useful if you are coming from the more abstract topological vector space concept.

The definition section is now too long and detailed. I think the subject is specialized enough so that we can assume the reader is familiar with the basic concepts which are now explained in detail in the definition.

Bah.  Spelling is important when the medium being used is written. )
I don't understand why you are insisting on having a separate NPOV template instead of allowing the issue to be noted in the """"Multiple issues"""" template that is already in the article.  Can you please explain?   

Oh I dont doubt the importance of spelling, its typing I find difficult. This article is so POV, I do intend to seek out some other refs but NPOV demands both sides are prevsented and as I made clear on the talk that isnt happening in this article. That some rascist editors are targetting it (eg the banned fourdee) is ample evidence of that. I am baffled as to why anyone would remove the NPOV tag, I never do that before resolving the issue,  
Please answer the question: Why do you insist on a separate NPOV template when the other one communicates the exact same idea but with less clutter?   

I removed the blue tag. I want the orange tag there and I have fully explained my reasons. The article presents one side of an argument and not the other. I dont understand what the controversy is as I removed the unnotable blue tag,  
No, I'm afraid that you haven't answered the question.  I don't see a need to for multiple templates when one easily suffices.   
Nor do I. That is why I have removed the blue tag. An orange NPOV tag was created for a reason and it should stay as an orange tag. What is the problem?

The other day I wanted to look up something about the T.A.R.P., and I went to the Wikipedia article and found a lot of misplaced newspaper headlines in the top of the article. They were clearly out of place, so I removed them. I hope you come to some sort of resolution with your sockpuppet fears. If you're too stressed out or feel like you're taking on the world, just take a few days off from editing. And I really cant' emphasize enough, you seem like you're interested in journalism. You should start a blog. I think you'd be good at it. Just keep in mind Wikipedia isn't a soapbox, news stand, blog, newspaper, or anything else. It's just an encyclopedia.",0
"Missing the Forest... 

I just have to add a comment to this talk page, in light of the ongoing struggle over administrator priviledge and userboxes.  I try hard to assume good faith, and I certainly would like to have the same assumed of my actions.  Having contributed a number of userboxes, and finding them deleted without notice, I was confused.  Upon digging deeper, I saw that the problem was much more serious that a few templates being deleted out of process.  There are a number of admins that seem to think that they have the right to dictate to the masses what is and is not acceptable content in the user space.  This is wrong.  User space is where wikipedians are allowed to express their POV, personal convictions, and interests.  Admins do have a responsibility to wikipedia, but first and foremost it should be recognized that wikipedia only exists because of wikipedians.  Actions such as mass purges, mass deletions, and mass edits without explanation, are basically the most disruptive possible avenue available.  In the grand scheme of things, userboxes are basically unimportant, but they have become the most critical issue on the wikipedia at present because they have been attacked by administrators without comment or explanation, outside of process, and with no regard for the impact this has on the community.  I am unhappy with your part in this, Tony, and I expected better.  I feel that admins should learn from their mistakes, and the mistakes of others, but I am afraid I see these being repeated.  If you feel you have the right, then you are welcome to exercise it - but you will destroy the wikipedia if you destroy the desire of wikipedians to participate.  I think you should take some time to admire the forest before you start chopping down the trees that others have planted with love.",0

 Umm, neither of those examples is actually correct. On metalworking machinery, they are dovetail *slides*. They don't join. They make a sliding fit which is resistant to lifting. You can achieve the same effect with box ways by putting a sliding surface along the opposite side from the main bearing surface, but a dovetail is cheaper to make. In turbines, they are not called dovetails and they are not the same shape. They are called """"christmas trees"""" in the shop, my aging brain has forgotten the correct technical term. But it ain't """"dovetail."""" They are shaped like an upside-down christmas tree with NO SHARP CORNERS. The principal is similar but not the same as a dovetail.

Fascism  is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. Influenced by national syndicalism, the first fascist movements emerged in Italy around World War I, combining more typically right-wing positions with elements of left-wing politics, in opposition to communism, socialism, liberal democracy and traditional conservatism. Although fascism is usually placed on the far right on the traditional left–right spectrum, fascists themselves and some commentators have argued that the description is inadequate.""",0

This is childlish:

First of all, I am tired of people who show up to a page and think they have the right to add any modifications they feel like. Next time, before you have the intentions of modifying the alticle considerably (or the contents in this case) it would be wise to write down something in the discussion page, otheriwse you work might end up being in vane.
Secondly, the tempalte for the content is BY FAR THE UGLIEST I have ever seen. It quite hard for a newcomer to realize he has got to look through the text. The old content probably wasn't the best possible, but was significantly better. Also, the old content is not occupied by history in more than 50%. 
I understand Romania has a rich history, but the notion of independence was not a huge idea before 1800s. India has existed as a 'culture' long before the Roman Empire, therefore there is no point in comapring the importance of the history section of the two countries. Check the Germany article to see the model I have edited the format of the history section. You are welcome to edit the history section, but do not add 20 entries about history in the contents section (i.e.: that is why national awakening, independence and union are in the same section; feel free to modify the name, but do not further split it). Also, for similar reasons, there is little point in expanding the section about Dacia.
I might be worong, but you seem to play around a lot with the position of the images. Please do not. Right now they are placed where they are because of some specific reasons.
I will add more comment later 

Now the answers:
 You are welcome. Next time you add about 30k+ of information to an article and somebody comes and starts freaking with the article, you will be really happy.
 Appearance and professional looking? Is that what you are calling the template for the contents section? Come on, try to be objective and agrre that even the contents section on the present page is really ugly.
 I have allready replied to this and I do not feel the need to throw away some of my time to add more reasoning to this rather retarded dispute. Note: The big size also has a real outcome, and that is the article is really annoying to edit because it takes almost 10secs between the press of the save button and the reloading of the page (and it is not my connection)
 Again I allready explained this. The issue was not the byte count but the length of the contents section that took several pages to scroll down (and I think more than hald of the contents were SMALL entries into the history section).
 The article is about Romania, not about the History of Romania. Again feel free to click this link and edit. The history is there, it happened, and therefore the history ARTICLE should be expanded. """"(some of us hate to change pages!)"""" Some other readers hate to search stuff about Romania and have to scroll down through pages of history to get to some more present facts."""" Putting links is not equivilent to giving a reader a recap of the era—in particular, I find the way you did it in that page to be poorly prioritized."""" This is your opinion. The page has beeen previously reviewed by other users (check the article milistone) and they found it actually really aggreable and felt the need to specify the usefulness of the way it was 'prioritizied'.
 For exampel in Europa Yearbook (a kind of printed version of CIA Factbook that is printed yearly). Also, your example with journals is at least annoying. Journals are actually reviewed by professionals, which means that people who nt what is happening agree on those formalities. This is not Libertatea where you need to put catchy titles to make people buy your crap. This is an encyclopaedia and should have some professionalism in the way titles are given.
 I checked and decided the contents section is REAAAAALLY """"off-putting"""". It is unfortunate, but I find it fair to undo edits from people who do not ask first, than to reedit their edits.
 IT IS UGLY!!!!!! Also, what browsers? Anything that is not Firefox or IE has no weight. (i.e. even Opera is a niche browser)

Also, I did not get the joke about first of July. If you were refering to the date I have created this account, then... you are at least superficial to base your opinions on that. There are al least two possibilities that you cannot prove with this kind of research: 1) that I did not have another account before then. 2) that I did not do real publishing in real life (i.e. in real Journals, were people review your stuff before publishing)

It is not easier to balance an egg on its end on the first day of spring. In fact, the ease or difficulty of balancing an egg is the same throughout the year. This myth is said to originate with the egg of Li Chun, an ancient Chinese folk belief that it is easier to balance an egg on Li Chun, the first day of spring in the Chinese calendar. In Chinese Li means setup/erect, Chun spring/egg. Setup spring is a Chinese solar term, literally interpreted as erecting an egg for fun.

 NPOV violations
 Making bold edits
 Unintentional misinformation
 Unintentional nonsense
 Stubbornness
 Harassment or personal attacks

Out of the two lists my edits could only possibly fall into three categories, however I would disagree with two of them:
NPOV violation - I am removing POV from the article by ensuring CP is correctly quoted and that an alternative viewpoint is offered to the liberally biased criticism of the project
Stubbornness - if standing up for the truth and acting as a barrier to the liberal smears rampant on the project makes me stubborn then so be it, but history will judge me as being forced to engage in edit wars against other stubborn editors who refused to consider anything other than their liberal delusions

Some early books I have found on Google Books refer to is as Reform Judaism; I am always corrected about this. My point is that when you say """"all types of Judaism"""", Orthodox Jews do not view Conservative Judaism as being any different than Christianity or Islam with regards to validity.

 Thanks for your reply. You're right that it's common, but it's still wrong according to the Manual of Style. Links should only be included if they're useful to the user: too many links are distracting. It's not useful to link every possible word when there's no doubt about its meaning. So, to take a cricket example, if you write """"He played his first Test match in 1928"""", it's useful to link """"Test match"""" because people might not know what a Test match is and might want to follow the link to look it up. But it's not useful to link 1928 because everyone knows when 1928 was, so the link doesn't help anyone.

I feel bad, too, JG. I know I can have a real smart, sarcastic mouth when I get totally frustrated, and when it gets going, look out! I apologize... Seriously. I don't want bad blood between us.

I do have a POV, of course. We all do. But in an entry that is explaining the traditionalist POV (where there is """"the"""" trad POV), it matches. And when it comes to external links/further reading (not """"sources""""), then traditionalist websites deserve to be represented as much as others. I mean, on a page on Hannukah, there might be a link to """"An Orthodox Hannukah"""" or """"Reformed Readings for Hannukah,"""" but with Dominick it seems to be only his way or no way. He can't add a link for balance, or add """"a traditional Catholic site"""" tag, or group links under headings as you did; he removes and replaces and mischaracterizes in the edit summaries.

I am totally fine with any links to my site being labelled """"a traditional Catholic site"""" or what not (though I think the same thing ought to work in the other direction such that EWTN, for ex., is labelled a """"conservative"""" or """"neo-conservative"""" site  not that I am worked up about going through Wiki and making it so, but the point remains). 

I'm glad you liked at least most of the page on the Rosary! (I think if you looked at the links mentioned in my RfC, you will actually like them, too  at least most of them. Seriously, check this section of the site out, and the sub-sections inside of it, like the """"Customs of the Liturgical Year"""" section. There is nothing like it out there on the Net, and I'm not finished yet!) But your words show the key differences between traditionalists and conservatives/neo-conservatives: you use the phrase """"attacks on Pope John Paul II"""" with regard to the footnote about trads' opinions that changing the Mysteries of the Rosary was unwise, but we don't see it as an """"attack"""" but a criticism. Even St. Paul himself resisted St. Peter, our first Pope, """"to the face"""" when His Holiness did an unwise thing (Galatians 2), and St. Catherine of Siena used to write letters to the Pope, basically telling him to act like a man LOL Our differences pretty much come down to different understandings of infallibility, to perceptions of our ability to criticize and resist prudential, pastoral decisions, and to our different notions of Christian obedience (and here different trads have different opinions as to what should be obeyed or rightfully resisted, because that is a prudential concern in itself, one that each Catholic has to study and pray about).

But no matter whether you and Dominick and I agree or not (we don't have to agree to be decent to each other, and some of my favorite people are conservative Catholics!), there is a trad """"movement"""" out there, and we have as much """"right"""" to be heard as anyone else. Or imagine that we're not even Catholic at all and there's a page on the Rosary: no one would remove a link to """"Anglican Rosary practices."""" I just feel as if the traditional viewpoint is being censored, and it frustrates me (it doubly frustrates me when links like this aren't only removed, but are labelled """"blog"""" or """"[[monograph|monographs]"""". It's beyond belief, really, that he is allowed to get away with it).

I will promise you this: from here on out, if I add any links to the site (only on relevant pages, of course), I will use the word """"a traditional Catholic site"""" or some such after it, or will group links so that the fact that it is a trad site is clear. If I come across any older links that have already been added (and not all have been added by me, BTW), I will edit to do the same. Sound good?

The year 140 AD is leap year so if Thoht 1 is July 20 in 139 AD
it is July 19 for the next 3 years, all 4 years claimed as the rise of Sothis.
The year 2773 BC is likewise a Thoth 1 on July 17 whose previous year is July 18.
4241 BC is a July 19 date for Thoth 1.
As for correlation placing Egypt's earliets dates as 2170 BC and 2030 BC and 2001 BC etc;
the date for Thoht 1 is Jan 6 in 2001 BC and the winter solstice.
The wprt name for new year has been used for sothis but also for solstice
and not clear whether winter or summer. Connecting it to Nile flood doesnt help
when the myth of Noah's flood is at winter solstice. Further, if Thot is the 7th month
then Epagum days begin July 5 in 2001 BC so that the July 10 solstice is Pamenot 1 not 6.
Every disagreement in short Genesis has a counterpart application in Egypt.
Example, reunification in year 955. If Flood is year 600, and Noah dies in year 350,
he dies in the year 350 that the Pharaoh was created.
If using a 360-day calendar for those 350 years, then from year 600 it is year 955.
Unification of dynasties 1-5 is then the same year and event for dynasties 6-10.
The 5th being dead in Genesis in year 340, but in LXX in year 768.
The date 1872 BC July 17 is Memphis. But what if its at Fort Quban where
sothis rises on July 10 the solstice during the 12th dynasty. That blows those
who try to trace July 20 back to a Gregorian solstice in 4242 BC.
And at the time of that July 10 date in the year 120 of the 12th dynasty,
let's say 1824 BC July 10 as second month Parmuti 16 (versus 8th month 22)
we have Paopi 16 on Jan 6, so which is the wprt sopken of in record, winter or summer sothic.",0

I agree with Lisa that the first sentence should make a positive statement that describes what Judaism's view is, not vaguely describe what the view is like.  Lets look at the topic sentences of some recent versions.
Judaism's view of Jesus is a very peripheral one. fails completely. Not describing Judaism's view at all.  The second sentence Jews have traditionally seen Jesus as one of a number of false messiahs who have appeared throughout history. is worth considering, but think it is not informative enough. 
Judaism's view of Jesus is largely defined by the Jewish principles of faith, rejecting any view of Jesus as divine """"Christ"""", or """"son of God"""". falls short, being too hesitant.  perhaps simply.Judaism reject any view of Jesus as divine """"Christ"""", or """"son of God"""".
Judaism has no special or particular view of Jesus, with very few texts in Judaism directly referring to or taking note of Jesus, and disputes all Christian interpretations of canonical Jewish scripture that allegedly make reference to him. does a decent jobs but the lack of text reference and disputing Christian interpretation are not really the most important things for an intro.

The external links I reverted were matching the following regex rule(s): rule: '[a-za-z][0-9]{2,}\.photobucket\.com/albums/.*\.jpg' . If the external link you inserted or changed was to a media file (e.g. an image or a sound or video file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's copyright policy and therefore probably should not be linked to.  Please consider using our upload facility to upload a suitable media file.

Please read Wikipedia's external links guideline for more information, and consult my . For more information about me, see . Thanks!   

Granted - yes, they are links.... but to PHOTOS intended for that particular entry. They are of the album, the tv show, and the video respectively.

Of course, a stupid BOT would not know this. I suggest a HUMAN review the data personally.

 Republic of Korea 

It's irritating to that this page is titled """"South Korea"""", which is nothing more than a regional designation. Maybe a page on the unique geographical or cultural/historical happenings on the southern part of the Korean peninsula would be accurately named, but there doesn't seem to be a good reason not to redirect to Republic of Korea. China, for instance, isn't the page name for the People's Republic of China. There are plenty of other counter examples, of course, Japan being the name of the page for the State of Japan, or Zimbabwe for the Republic of Zimbabwe, or a dozen others, but these names are so close to their formal names as to only designate the form of government. Because of the DPRK and ROK's mutual use of the term 'Korea', this isn't a satisfactory alternative. """"South Korea"""" reads increasingly anarchronistic, a vestigal designation from the Korean war when the difference between the two countries was most importantly location-geographic in the sense of military holdings, and a division which was supposed to be temporary. Does anyone have thoughts on this, or an argument why we shouldn't use a nation's preferred English designation for itself? 210.103.36.58  """,0

I would also add that Schlesinger, as a historian of the United States, a country which has never seen viable communist or fascist movements, would seem a poor choice as a specialist to quote.

 For each report, there's a /Configuration subpage (e.g., Wikipedia:Database reports/Articles containing red-linked files/Configuration). This houses the code that the report uses (assuming the page is up-to-date). If you want reports in English, you shouldn't need to modify this code at all, you just need to run it.
 If you look at  you can see the source code for the database reports. There's also a file called settings.sample. Following the format in that file, you'll need to create your own settings.py file with the appropriate information. Your host is probably """"localhost"""".
