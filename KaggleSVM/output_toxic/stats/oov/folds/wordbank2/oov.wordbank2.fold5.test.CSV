"From Depleted Uranium in Urine of Soldiers by the WISE Uranium Project:

Is DU more hazardous than natural uranium, since it contains contaminants such as uranium-236, plutonium-239, etc.?

No. Depleted uranium used for bullets has been found to contain trace amounts of artificial radionuclides, such as uranium-236, neptunium-237, and plutonium-239. The presence of these radionuclides can be explained by contamination from recycling of spent fuel introduced in the manufacturing process; for details, see [Diehl 2002]. The radiation dose from exposure to such contaminated DU is only a fraction of a  percent higher than from pure DU - and thus still is lower than from natural uranium; for details, see [Diehl 2001].",0

I read the cited reference. It is extremely vague about actual facts. All I can discern is that Kennedy wrote Andropov (not the KGB) offering public relations advice. The specific contents are not mentioned at all. This makes me extremely suspicious. No sourcing for the """"treason"""" language was provided, it appears that possibly some blog used the term. If you care to re-write it, please focus very carefully on the actual _facts_ presented in the source, and not their spin or interpretation (CNS is quite partisan). All I could find was one fact satisfying both WP:RS and WP:V — That a poli sci prof said Kennedy offered public relations advice to Andropov. I think we should wait until the major press have had a go at it, and some actual facts (memo contents for example) are available before spending a lot of energy on it. Derex """,0

He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk) 

I'll keep an eye on it. I also find it a little hard to believe that he was kicked out of San Francisco State for writing a novel that was """"too radical."""" -) Steve Dufour (talk)

 User TastyCakes Superior Intellect Shines in Message 

Greetings All!!!

Once again, the user TastyCakes showcases her superior intellect and reasoning in her response.

Instead, user TastyCakes and an admin MarkSweep took it upon themselves to block user HerrGoebbles with absolutely no warning.

The RMS Titanic was an Olympic-class passenger liner owned by British shipping company White Star Line and built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, United Kingdom. For her time, she was the largest passenger steamship in the world.

On the night of 14 April 1912, during the ship's maiden voyage, Titanic hit an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later, early on 15 April 1912. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. The high casualty rate was due in part to the fact that, although complying with the regulations of the time, the ship did not carry enough lifeboats for everyone aboard. The ship had a total lifeboat capacity of 1,178 people, although her capacity was 3,547. A disproportionate number of men died due to the women-and-children-first protocol that was followed.

The Titanic used some of the most advanced technology available at the time and was popularly believed to have been described as """"unsinkable.""""[6] It was a great shock to many that, despite the extensive safety features and experienced crew, the Titanic sank. The frenzy on the part of the media about Titanic's famous victims, the legends about the sinking, the resulting changes to maritime law, and the discovery of the wreck have contributed to the continuing interest in, and notoriety of, the Titanic.

Eric's got form for this sort of thing - if he gets it into his head you're a wrong'un, no amount of evidence or explanations as to how you've never acted against him, had any crossed words with him, or how you actually even like him, will make any difference to him. Although possibly aggravated by his well renowned poor memory for the names of other editors he interacts with, as you saw when you corrected him about his claim you always start ANI threads, he just ignored you and instead upped the ante, referring to your """"obvious campaign of harassment"""" of him. A clear personal attack if ever there was one. He's done it with this 'reformed' account many times already, he did it when he was socking on his 'roommate' account, and he did it when he was just plain old Malleus the b/tard. It's ironic this behaviour is the same sort of bullying he often accused admins of doing. And with no hint of irony at all from him, he accused you of trying to demean and patronise him, even though that's basically how he treats anyone on Wikipedia he doesn't agree with. Still, as you see, nobody cared, due to the fact he gets special protection from the likes of Drmies.""",0

Yes, I'm sure it's possible that the many books and articles on the topic, written by various well-known authors, or found in reputable sources, are, in fact, completely wrong, but you'd have to find other reputable sources to refute them; your own personal concern with the concept is not particularly relevant.  Regarding the definition, it's pretty much the same as it was 3 months ago, and the forumulation which presents it more as perception than fact is in deference both to NPOV, and to various editors (like yourself) who were opposed to the concept that it existed at all.  Finally, the photograph does not really illustrate the concept well; a far better one would be the rather common """"Star of David = Swastika"""" signs you say at various rallies. (talk) 17:53""",0
"""

Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond that
Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  

First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  

Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with """"probabilities"""". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say """"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it"""". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  

Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, """"B"""" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if """"A"""" were a dead body and """"B"""" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, """"A"""", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed """"B"""". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.

"Firstly, Montanabw, there is no such thing as Equus caballus. That is a domesticated animal. The proper name is Equus ferus caballus - unless domesticated Horses somehow come from Zebras or Asses... Also, there is no consensus that Equus ferus ever set foot on the North American continent, though I personally believe Equus lambei may be a subspecy of Equus ferus. Thirdly, and most importantly, and I hope EVERYONE is listening here when I say this, Equus ferus caballus, the domesticated Horse IS NO MORE native to the North American west than Chihuahuas are to the Canadian tundra. Domestic forms are native NOWHERE. Period. The domestic Horse is RADICALLY different from it's wild ancestor. And Dysmorodrepanis, the reason all the Equine articles are so Horse-centric is because a very large number of vociferous (and outright foolish) people are unhealthily obsessed with horses. Unfortunately, many of these people also think themselves expert enough to declare a domestic animal native to a continent it never inhabited simply because they like to watch them run. Seriously, that's all it is. They like looking at them. It's certainly not an environmental issue. Horses are wildly destructive to their surroundings. They eat more than cattle! And an obscene amount more than the native Pronghorn (which, by the way doesn't trample its food to death like the Mustangs do with they're enormous, heavy-stepping hooves). The only argument the Mustang and Burro worshippers have to use (and they milk it good, let me tell ya) is the similarity of Equus lambei to Equus ferus. But, Equus lambei has not been proven to be synonymous with Equus ferus (though it is a possibility), and even if it were it would be more closely related, by far, to Przewalski's Horse than to Mustangs! E. lambei was tiny! It was like four feet tall at the shoulders! And all the other North American Equids are pretty well-known to not be synonyms with Equus ferus (including E. caballus). Not by a long shot. This is why the Horse Evolution page (and every other page dealing with equines) has been changed back and forth so many times. The people who know what the heck they're talking about try to add useful information and correct blatant lies or grievous mistakes and the people who like pretty ponies go back and try to convince the world that Spanish horses have roamed every continent including Antarctica, Mars and the Sun since before Dinosaurs walked on two feet. I made the ridiculous mistake of trying to add factual information to the Mustang article and, if I remember correctly, it was changed WITHIN THE HOUR. The person doing the changing even removed the scientific names I inserted! The Mustang article has absolutely no indication of what specy the Mustang belongs to now! I swear this endless struggle between the My Little Ponyites and REAL BIOLOGISTS is like the Evolution vs. creationism argument, only dumber. Like I said, these people aren't calling for us to turn our rotweillers loose into the nearest forest, but why not? I mean, it's the same specy as the Gray Wolf. Domestication doesn't matter, if you listen to these people. If that's the case then why aren't we restocking mature Oak forests with farm raised white turkeys? I mean, it's the same specy, after all. Oh. And this is my favourite. Where Wild Asses are actually native they're critically endangered. But I have not read ONE WORD from the Cult of the Mustang and Burro about saving them from ACTUAL extinction, but get this, they want to have the Mustangs and Burros in America declared endangered species. How's that for mentally inept and savagely hypocritical?",0

Yes, there is.

If one clicks on the """"History"""" tab at the top of the article, one can see any comments or explanations that the editor has made when summarising their edit.

It's not just Irish Nationalists that are a wee bit (too?) sensitive about the term and in this case the sub-heading of """"British Isles"""" should dispel any lingering confusion - as does the internal linking or re-direction of """"The North East Atlantic Archipelago"""".

 Middle Bass Island 

Norman,

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site started as a non-commercial site and contains a great deal of island history as well as many, many island pictures. It's one of the most popular sites in the Lake Erie Islands.

Please take a look at """"Site Map Page 1"""" and """"Site Map Page 2"""" before removing the link again. Saying that the hundreds of pages listed there have only commercial value is idiotic.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

So what is your real rationale for deleting it again and again and again???

 Discussion moved from Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Doctor Who 

I know you're all probably sick to your back teeth of hearing about it, but considering how we have just changed the name of the 1996 television film to Doctor Who (1996) (in my personal opinion, an infinitely better name), why not try to resolve the seemingly never ending debate of whether it is 100,000 BC or An Unearthly Child? Talk:100,000 BC (Doctor Who)
 19:02, 9th January 2006 (GMT)

Okay can we also try to bring peace to the Middle East and Northern Ireland, bring harmony between all religions, sort out whether the UK is an international or European country and all those other things that have been fiercely argued a lot? ;-)  

I hate to say it, but I think the debate is about to get a second wind, seeing as the upcoming American DVD release, The Beginning dubs the story An Unearthly Child and also uses the Edge of Destruction name for the Inside the Spaceship two-parter...  

I think you're right, and that we should think about people less familiar with the original series; after all, a lot of people who have only watches the Ninth and Tenth Doctors in action will snap up the boxset, to learn more about Doctor Who. Calling it An Unearthly Child will not only help these """"newbies"""", but also seeth the feelings of quite a lot of Whovians I know. (As well as this, at least half of the sources I have seen - official or otherwise - call it """"An Unearthly Child"""").  20:39, 9 January 2006

The current opener to the article and the redirects handle the requirements anyway. Fandom has long been deeply divided and I don't think some notion of appeasing one wing of the debate should direct where the Wikipedia page is located.   
 I agree. As long as the proper redirects are in place and the article acknowledges the alternate titles, I think we're good. This isn't quite the same situation we had with the TV movie when an off-the-cuff remark by the producer calling it Enemy Within came to be seen as somehow official. (And the Doctor Who Information Network here in Canada apparently uses a different title altogether that was mentioned in a CBC profile of the series made to tie in with the Eccleston season. I forget the name that was used.).  

The CBC profile I think used """"Out of the Ashes"""", which apparently came from a misreading of Shannon Patrick Sullivan's webpage.  As for 100,000 BC vs. An Unearthly Child, I agree that the redirects and article opening make the issue less pressing, but I also think that the title used in the DVD release (which isn't just in the US, but UK as well) lends a bit more weight to the An Unearthly Child argument.  However, if we do reconsider the page's location, I agree that it shouldn't be about appeasing one group or another, but what's best for the article.  — (talk • contribs) 

The DVD releases seal it for me - these should both be at their DVD titles, with the others being redirects.  

That's a good point to raise. I personally believe that it should be An Unearthly Child; but then it's not up to me, and I fully understand where Josiah is coming from. Why don't we settle this once and for all: a democratic vote where Whovians like ourselves vote for one title or the other. Anyone else agree/have another idea?   16:18, 11 January 2006

I'll put my vote in as An Unearthly Child also.  

It's been said before, but I'll say it again. The title of the serial is 100,000 BC. The title of the first episode is """"An Unearthly Child"""". The fact that BBC Enterprises releases the DVD as """"An Unearthly Child"""" is a matter of marketing, not historicity, and neither here nor there. The real reason the serial was called An Unearthly Child to begin with was because of a mistake by the Radio Times. AUC redirects to the right page, and there's no confusion. I'd rather rename The Daleks to The Mutants rather than change 100,000 BC to that.  (talk • contribs) 16:39, 11 January 2006",0

Agreed.  That area of the table needs some work, and is not fully consistent on the distinction.  It came about because """"scheduled"""" (which was formerly the word used in all future launches) was both clearly incorrect and also unsourced for many of the rows in the table.  

When I looked at a bunch of the sources about a month ago (2015-02-14), for most of the far future launches, the most one could say is that they were """"under contract""""; while some of the very near term future launches (one to three ahead in the queue) were both clearly """"scheduled"""" and also scheduled with the particular local and national authorities to make the near term date have some meaning.  So that is what led to my attempt to improve the article by having a three-way distinction: 
 """"Scheduled (with range & launch license authorities)""""
 """"Scheduled""""
 """"Under contract""""

It appears that most of that bold edit was left, and has remained, while some parts have been modified by other editors.

The whole chemical weapons sections is skewed way out of proportion.

"""

 Troubling aspects of the artiicle as it exists right now 

1) I believe if Eric Altermann is to be accorded the prestige of being associated with msnbc.com, it should be noted that he is a blogger for msnbc.com. I say that because I found conservative columnist and author Michelle Malkin referred to as a blogger in another article and I do believe that's meant to diminish the value of her statement. So, again, yes. We HAVE to see the forest for the trees. No one article in Wikipedia exists in a vaccum. There has to be a baseline standard and I reject any argumentation that suggests implies or directs that if 'I don't like that article, go change it.' Instead, one way or the other (and I don't care which way) liberals and conservatives have to be characterized by the same fair measuring stick.

2) This is new. It's from Conason: """"Conason goes on to point out that Coulter's critical nature is blunted by her pre-assumed opinions, making many of the conclusions she draws irrelevant to the actual nature of her arguments."""" Wow! That seems a little unfair just hanging out there like that. I propose either eliminating it or...and I hate this approach as much as the next guy...scotch-taping a quote after that which refutes this obvious cheap-shot.

3) This is old. The McVeigh section, as should be no surprise to anyone who's followed my work here, is troubling. Let's start with this quote: """" She was willing to characterize members of the Branch Davidians at the Waco compound as """"harmless American citizens"""" [6] even after the survivors of the raid and subsequent immolation of the group by their leader were convicted.""""
Well, some Waco compounders were convicted of something or another. But the fact is that there WERE mostly innocent victims of David Koresh in that compound. It's unbalanced to just add the tag line about conviced Davidians without acknowledging what I GUARANTEE you Ann was referring to, which were the overwhelming number that were innocent. 

This quote is also troubling: """"Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his bombing."""" Well, McVeigh had LOTS of reasons for his bombing. But who cares what a madman thinks? And if you do, then I understand he also had some uncomplimentary things to say about the Bible. Therefore, if we are to include this in Coulter's section, I say we include it's compelement in Bill Maher's article. It would go something like this:
""""Naher has frequently criticized the Bible calling it a 'bunch of fairy tales' and claiming 'God doesn't write books.'  Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his distrust of Christianity, though the Bible has been widely criticized throughout history.""""

Whady'a say?

(Much more on this section later.)

4) Racism is not the same as being anti-Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans for supporting Israel etc. To title Ann's comments on Islamic Radicals as allegations of racism seems dishonest to me.

5) Did Ann really say that ALL  women are """"not as bright"""" as men'?
Some editor in Wikipedia wants us to think so. I say this quote be taken out until we get confirmation of her whole statement in context. Now, I know for a fact that Ann is only half-joking when she argues women should not be allowed to vote so she is far from imune when it comes to suggesting she holds less-than-boilerplate-feminist views. But this quote supposedly out of H & C seems like it's probably another smear. Again, if proven wrong, I'll gladly man up and stand corrected. But, unitl I'm proven it wrong, it should be excised in my view.

John: As you know the lead-in sentence for this article is In mathematics, a bivector is a quantity in geometric algebra that generalizes the idea of a vector. That is, this article in WP is about the bivector in geometric algebra (although it could be redesigned to deal with tensor algebra, I suppose, which topic is presently an afterthought at the end). As such, the section on Vector algebra is a subheading of the main topic, the bivector in geometric algebra. Consequently, the reference to the pseudovector in this subsection should make note of the predominant usage in texts on geometric algebra, namely that the bivector in 3D is the pseudovector, just another example of the (n-1) grade multivector being the pseudovector. No? Do you disagree about the common usage?

On that basis it is not exactly a mis-statement but certainly an easily mis-read statement in the article that says: in geometric algebra axial vectors are usually interpreted as bivectors.

 EVHS 

Hi, 

I saw you've been editing the EVHS article.  I wanted to bring a few things to your attention.  The user evhs00 has basically been copying the Los Alamos High School article.  (see for yourself).  Problem is that he's copied a great deal of stuff that does not apply to EVHS.  For instance he makes a serious of false, baseless and dubious claims:

 EVHS was one of Newsweek's 2007 """"1,000 Best High Schools in America"""" (#598).  This was baselessly copied from the LAHS article and is just false when applied to EVHS: 

http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=Rank&count;=1351&Search;=&start;=500&limit;=100&year;=2007&

 EVHS is """"mostly middle class"""".  A dubious claim considering espanola is one of the poorer cities in one of the poorest states and has 21% of its population living beneath the poverty level:

http://www.city-data.com/city/Espanola-New-Mexico.html

 Many other claims are suspect, uncited, and bear a clear similarity to claims on the LAHS article.   

Additionally, 

 The image of the sundevil mascot was taken from the Arizona State University article and is not fair use.

 The image of the basketball team was taken from the EVHS Athletics website and is not fair use. 

Basically there's no citations anywhere and the author's methodology is clearly one of blatant copying.  I really want to avoid an edit-war between rival high school articles so I'm not going to touch the EVHS article.  I'm actually really glad that somebody is working on the EVHS page.  But the author needs to learn how to work within the rules.

 Harrow 2013 
Doc James correctly reverted my removal of text cited to Harrow, noting that it is, in fact, a review although PubMed does not indicate so.  However, IMO the text in the article is too strong for what the source supports.  
conclusions from PMID 23512950, Harrow 2013 Overall, the longitudinal studies cited do not provide conclusive proof of a causal relationship between being off medications and being psychosis free. They do clearly indicate that not all schizophrenia patients need continuous antipsychotics for a prolonged period, providing extensive evidence of samples of medication-free schizophrenia patients with favorable outcomes.6,12,22 Is it at least a moderate-sized number of schizophrenia patients who do well, longitudinally, without medications? This important issue needs longitudinal research for more precise answers. The longitudinal studies indicate the importance of further research on how many schizophrenia patients profit from continuous administration of antipsychotics over a prolonged period, what factors identify and separate schizophrenia patients who do not need prolonged antipsychotic treatment, and whether or not prolonged use of antipsychotics is harmful for some or many patients.

The above-cited longitudinal results from many different countries and different types of schizophrenia patients provide data bearing on issues about long-term treatment. Discussions by Whitaker, Moncrieff, and others question long-term antipsychotic treatment.25–27 These disparate views, research by WHO and DOSMED in developing countries,12 and our own longitudinal studies5–7 should be considered as prompts for further long-term outcome research on this important issue.  This is not a strongly worded conclusion, where our article presents as fact what this article appears to be raising as an important question in need of further study.  I continue to believe this is not a strong enough source for the cited text.  Clearly, further research on this controversial matter is needed.  Can we either eliminate this source or reword the text to better match?  The strongest conclusion of this paper is that further study is needed.  Regards,  (Talk) """,0

Here is my documentation of how the phrase """"operating illegally"""" has entered into 12 Wikipedia articles that relate to unaccredited institutions.

 American University of London - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Suffield University - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until edited by 155.212.44.58, what appears to be a good-faith editor, inactive since 2007.
 List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Kingston College (British Columbia) - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Vancouver University Worldwide - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 American Conservatory of Music - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until edited by 38.104.166.30, what appears to be an account with a single purpose, operating for only 5 weeks, and touching only 2 articles, both about music schools.  One edit removed important information that was reliably sourced.
 Bircham International University - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Weston Reserve University - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Fidelis Oyakhilome - I was mistaken.  This article is not about unaccredited institutions, per se.
 Canterbury University (Seychelles) - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so, remarking that the edit was reverting """"excuse-making"""".
 Washington International University - no mention of """"operates illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Education in India - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until edited by Lalit Jagannath, an editor interested in India, not pushing a POV about unaccredited institutions.

As far as I could see, not one of these insertions were reliably sourced to a mainstream, journalistic publication.  They were marked against state websites that, as I've demonstrated, are proved to make claims about legality without any basis in actual judicial review.

So, we can clearly see that 73% of the mentions of """"operating illegally"""" in Wikipedia (as it relates to educational accreditation) is the sole responsibility of one administrator, .  However, , whom Orlady protects and tags off with on a regular basis, is concerned that I have an agenda that I'm pushing, and not Orlady who is responsible for 73% of a thematic agenda that now permeates multiple Wikipedia articles.  This is truly Orwellian.    """,0

Hi Halibutt,
Excellent to see more polish aircraft articles, but there seem to be some issues with these two:
The subject matter hardly warrants such detailed articles
A single article to cover both would be sufficient as they were VERY closely related and differed mainly in size and engine arrangements, i.e. merge them.
A variants section to explain the differences between the BN3, and T variants.
Try to use your own prose instead of parrotting references.
Avoid adding superfluous details, such as the various competing aircraft which should only get fleeting mentions at best.

Just some suggestions, but if you look at the articles again objectively you may see my points. 

Good luck and carry on writing articles.",0

Imagine finding an article in which every single word is wrong and you will imagine my pain at reading the current Martin Heidegger article. Nor am I the only one who thinks this. Please see the section immediately above this article. Or better yet, spend the next 24 hours reading the first sections of Sein und Zeit and you will see the ridiculousness of the article as it currently stands, which demonstrates no understanding of Heidegger, and leaves everyone who reads it dumber than  when they began and knowing less about everything. This is so atrocious that essentially the entire article as it stands needs to be deleted and began again. I have no more time for this.   

I tried to move the Dreyfus to the main article and now apparently all the material is destroyed. Do you have any comprehension of how bad this article currently is? One would have no idea that Heidegger was ever read anywhere outside of France from the current article. No summaries of Heidegger's important concepts are given. No understanding of any of Heidegger's ideas are conveyed. Since you have decided to destroy my work, you can keep your poor article, which reads as if it was machine-translated from a foreign language. You do not even let someone in the middle of working finish before you destroy their work. No wonder zero academics contribute to this site and your articles are so atrocious. Anyone who reads the article as it currently stands comes away knowing less about Heidegger than they did before because of all of the obvious distortions and gross inaccuracies. You have not even succesfully explained a single one of Heidegger's terms or concepts here, or why anyone should care who he is. This article is an embarassment indeed.

 On his recent arrest 
This news item (published by Keyhān newspaper, in Persian  on 7 March 2010) gives the reason for Mr Panahi's recent arrest. Briefly, according to Keyhān, Mr Panahi had been secretly producing a film at his home, a film that the newspaper calls """"anti-régime"""" (alleyh-e nezām) and aimed at being released outside Iran. Keyhān says that there has not been any """"party"""" going on at Mr Panahi's home at the time of arrests and the people arrested had not been """"guests"""", but a number of people working on the film at issue. Keyhān cites the source of this news to Sobh-e Sǎdegh, and says """"according to a knowledgeable source"""", but I have not looked into the latter publication. """,0

That is a bit much to tackle all at once, so I'll start with the basics. Your edits removed a reliable source dealing directly with the topic (namely, the article from the St. Petersburg Times). Your edit also added material from a source which I believe is unencyclopedic and fails this site's sourcing policies. Both aspects make the article poorer. I will go into more detail once I have time to fully digest your argument, but for now, the Times article is entitled """"Doctor's syndrome a sham, board says"""". Our article reflects the content of that reliable source. I don't see any similarly reliable independent, fact-checked, third-party sources that have appeared in the intervening years to contradict that assessment - certainly the Board left the door open for medical science to corroborate Wilson's claims, but I see no reliably sourced evidence that such corroboration has occurred. Let's start with the best available sources on the topic, and follow where they lead - that's the gist of this site's policies and expectations. '''''' Talk """,0

If you look at the Mugabe you will find the situation is more complex than 'anonymous vandalism'.

Regrettably, I have to agree about the Gameplay section. It comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games, using Mother 3 as an example, than a proper encyclopedic entry. I won't quickfail just for this, but I do want it fixed before I'll pass. I'd prefer the section to be rewritten entirely, but some glaring points follow:
""""Mother 3 is presented in eight chapters with rotating player-characters including the protagonist's """"cowboy father"""", the """"family dog"""", an """"inept thief"""", and """"abused monkey"""""""" - So is the protagonist not playable? How large is the party? Why are these descriptions in quotes? - it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. Actually, why isn't the protagonist named in this section? Again, I completely understand the desire to approach this from an out-of-universe perspective, but only to the point where the prose doesn't trip over its own detachment.
""""Mother 3 begins with naming the members of the player-character's family along with questions of the player's favorite food and """"thing"""",[3] and opens to a """"pastoral forest village"""" soon interrupted by a forest fire and the Pig Mask Army, who impose police state-like conditions on the village.[2] With the fire's outbreak, the father ventures out to protect his family (twin sons Lucas and Claus and wife Hinawa), but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot.[1] They set out to take down the Pig Mask Army.[4] Lucas, the game's hero, does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. The game features a lighthearted plot, with enemies like """"partying ghosts"""" and """"talking rope snakes"""".[5] Porky, a character from EarthBound, appears as the leader of the Pig Mask Army and is the game's main antagonist. In addition, other EarthBound characters, such as Dr. Andonuts and Mr. Saturn, also appear."""" - Why isn't this stuff in Plot? The cast of characters does need to be introduced better, but jamming plot details into Gameplay isn't the way to do that.
The second paragraph is better; it's more in line with what I expect from a GA gameplay section. At least, it's good until """"Apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic, the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor."""" What's the predecessor's battle system like? Remember, not everyone reading this has played EarthBound.
""""There is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles"""" - First of all, this should start off with a """"However"""" or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. The information is also lacking, though - why isn't there a need to grind for experience? I think of this as one of the central, love-it-or-hate-it JRPG mechanics, and I'm curious as to how the genre might work without it. Imagine reading a Pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed (which is unusual for a JRPG) without giving a brief overview of how the PC and Day Care systems work - that's how I feel reading this.
"""" and lets the player see their magic """"PSI power"""" abilities"""" - Viewing your abilities probably isn't a necessary gameplay detail, but why isn't there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? And do they have uses outside battle, like HMs, Rock Smash, Secret Power, and Softboiled do in Pokémon?
""""While Mother 3's music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new, it features similar sound effects."""" - By """"completely new"""" do you mean it isn't recycled wholesale, or that the style is somehow new? Also, this bit probably doesn't belong in Gameplay.

If you're up to rewriting this, which I encourage - especially if you're shooting for FA - I'd recommend a structure like the following:
Paragraph 1: It's a top-down JRPG, there's an overworld, you explore towns with your team of characters, yada yada yada.
Paragraph 2: There are battles, they're not random (with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles - is it like in Pokémon Colosseum where you only fight other Trainers, or like in Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them?), this is how the battle system works, this is how items work, this is how experience points/leveling work (again, how is this the case without grinding? Or is a different system used entirely?).
Paragraph 3: Your team consists of such-and-such a number of characters, they change with different events in the story, characters do/don't return once they leave, here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle.
Stuff like items and saving (can you save anywhere?) - work in wherever you want; I'm not picky.   21:47, 25 September 2014 (UTC",0

Mentioning Darwin gave up natural selection and became a Lamarckian

The article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that Darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a Lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of The Origin of Species, which went into 6 different editions by 1872. Hence I propose the following insert at the first Darwin quotation in the current section ‘Publication of the theory of natural selection’, which I also propose should be retitled ‘Publication of the Darwin’s theory of evolution’.

Proposed insert:

'However,  even in the first edition of his book Darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection, but not the only one. In the last sentence of its Introduction he said “Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”

But by 1872 he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions, and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance Darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution, with its strong principle of inheritance, in favour of Lamarckian environmentalism, with a changing environment as the main selector. As C.D. Darlington wrote in 1950 in his Foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of The Origin:

""""Let no one imagine, however, that, in the world of science, Darwin's theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. On the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....The most abiding source of trouble was that discovered  by the Professor of Engineering at Edinburgh. Professor Fleming[sic] Jenkin pointed out in 1867, that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type, and its differences, as Darwin believed, blended in inheritance. Nature would never be able to keep any differences to select. 

Darwin's defence against this objection was already prepared. He had hinted it in the first edition of The Origin of Species: at the end of the Introduction he had said that """"Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."""" In later editions he hedged further. He fell  back on the other means. These depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment: its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. In adopting this view Darwin was giving up his own, and Wallace's, peculiar claim to originality: he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book: and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of Lamarck."""" 
[p. xvii On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection first edition reprint in The Thinker's Library by Watts & Co, 1950.] '

But Darlington failed to establish Lamarck's theory was discarded or disreputable. In fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid-20th century with the ‘Mendelian-Darwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. But even by 1950 Darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to Darlington:

""""In view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that Darwinism, in all civilised countries, would be taught as one of the foundations of thought, that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. That is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. But where, as in its applications to ourselves, in the study of the genetics of men, and to the histories of nations, as exact knowledge of the principles of variation, hybridization and selection is required, we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. At the same time the foundation of Darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in Darwin's own country. The Universities, with their museums and botanic gardens, are happy to forget what, in 1859, they were unable to resist. They contain no memorial of his work,  and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. The old pedantic learning of botany and zoology, which Darwin treated as one subject, they continue to cleave asunder, burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction."""" [‘’ibid’’ pxviii-xix]. '

I also propose the following edit of the article's introduction:

So, as another problem w/ this website, you might just not comprehend many features of what I have been saying about the website's features.

Or, maybe you like having me typewrite f/ several hours extra, as I've already proclaimed that it's excruciating.

This may not be accurate; but, very little of what you,  many of you, say about me is anywhere close to accurate:  I feel as if I, me, am fighting from w/in my disabilities, on the largest website, aside from  searchengines, against several thousand members of an  oligarch   plutocrat   overclass, with the wealth to purchase a new machine, w/ the best programming, every time a new  television commercial  flashes.

Again, that may not be accurate; but, that is how it seems.

Through nearly two years, I've fought through many misperceptions.  Several of you have insisted on """"brain damaged"""".  One  aqua  has insisted that I'm too European, something that it had found on another website about France, Italy.

Now, role has insisted that I'm too American, despite what I've written about  bbcamerica, & that I do not comprehend a clock, nor a  calendar.

You've deleted my response to those attacks; you've deleted my plea for more description of the wings.   Your deletion converted role's attacks into libel.  Minor, virtually insignificant libel; but, libel  nonetheless.

&, with all of the other libel that you, all of you, have attacked me with, for two years, how else might I stop it?

As long as you insist that you were correct all along, that  obviates all  apology:

  I would urge you not to remove other's {others'} comments with a summary of """"libel"""" unless they really are. I still don't see any libel in them.

That sentence means that you assert the right to  label, including  libel.  That is not apology.

First you have me too European, then too American, both as insults,..... libel.

If someone offers an apology, then virtually completely contradicts it, well, what is that?

When I had heard  Peter_Burkill's name, I had input his name, immediately, on this website.  That brought me to that page.  I had recalled another crash long ago.  I'd, eventually, confirmed the name, through some searches,  Alfred_Haynes.  I wanted to assert a connection there, & honor them.

You can clearly see when I'd learned of  Eric_Moody,  John_Coward.  Each of those names are rather ironic, considering who they are, in reality.

Why does what I've said of the wings  offend you such that you cannot even acknowledge that I've said it many, many times over?

Well, I know, factually, that I've read several messages, pining f/ a way, to trick me off, force me off, otherwise get rid of,.....

Well, one specific method to reduce the time that I have to scribe on this website would also be positive: if I could figure how to start one, or more, of my own.  It is obvious that many of you do not prefer positive  modi operandi.  But, however, maybe one of you, @ least one, is truly positive, & sufficiently  knowledgeable.

If any of you are positive, yet approximately as  ignorant  as I am, I would accept, welcome, your assistance anyhow.

I do hope to improve this  disambiguation:

Since this grotesque offense started I have probably been solely and directly responsible for 85% of the material attempted to be posted.

I am stating as a fact that the entire WIKI premise has evolved into a joke and a 100% waste of time. WHY SHOULD I continue to fight the vast multitude badgehuters?
There ain't a single speck of ethics in ANY of the full time WIKI retards doing censorship as a career choice, probably because children aren't mature enough to learn what they are.

 A lot of points to respond to.
Aleenf1 - you once again ignored the fact (or are being misleading intentionally) about national titles.  On Wikipedia pages, we use China, Laos, Palestine, Iran, etc. when those are NOT the official IOC designations.  Not only are those now the official names, those are not even the official IOC designations.  Yet, we still use them without question.  It is only with the situation of Taiwan that you make an issue of it.  I am not even proposing the sole use of Taiwan, just it's mention as a parenthetical.  Otherwise, I insist that you use People's Republic of China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Islamic Republic of Iran, Palestinian Authority, ETC. as those are the IOC designations for those countries.  THAT is where your hypocrisy lies.
Rebskii - People SEE Chinese Taipei, but they don't know it is Taiwan.  Why do you think one of Taiwan's gold medal winners had to declare before the international press in Athens, in English, """"I am from Taiwan.""""?  It is because there is much confusion among people.  I spoke with a couple of Australian baseball fans who made the trip from Australia to see the 2006 Intercontinental Cup here in Taichung.  They didn't know that Chinese Taipei was in fact Taiwan until they started making plans for the trip.  It is not even universally known among sports fans, much less the general public.
As for the domains of Taiwan, Orchid Island and Green Island, among others, are historically linked with Taiwan and have long been administratively a part of Taiwan.  The only counties that are not historically part of Taiwan are the tiny islands with some 10,000 people off the coast of Fujian which produces none of our athletes.  Taiwan is the commonly used phrase on the street domestically, not ROC and not Chinese Taipei.
We are not bound by the opinions and illegal claims of barbarous dictators in Beijing.  
If you look at the good article guidelines, one of them is that the article should provide appropriate information for people who are not necessarily familiar with the subject.  Simply stating Chinese Taipei does not meet that standard because few people know what it is.  A simple parenthetical (Taiwan) beside Chinese Taipei accomplishes one of the standards of good article writing with very little trouble.
Again, if you insist on ONLY Chinese Taipei because that is the IOC designation, then use all of the other IOC designations for the other countries I have listed above.

Speedy deletion of Murder Manifest
 A tag has been placed on Murder Manifest requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

Hi again dear

yes I strongly support independence of """"south Azerbaijan"""" from Iran, If Green movement could change somethings, probably I would change my idea, but I dont want to be under Islamic rejim anymore and I support the changing of destiny of Azerbaijani people.

And about """"Azerbaijanis are Turks or not"""". Despite you are talking about Persian theory of the roots of Turkish people, we all know that Turks started to migrate here circa 1000 ad when Saljuk Turks of west branch(Oghuz)started to come, but infact it is not important when they came here. The important thing is """"EVERY ONE"""" in Azerbaijan feel themselves as Azerbaijani( and not Azeri which is an invented word by Persians) Turks and believe that they r Turks and speak Turkish lang. as same as Turks of Turkey. You can come here and ask yourself one by one, you will see. It is so irrarational to say to some one that:"""" No, you r not Turk, you dont know who you are! I know! you r Azeri and Azeris are indoeuropean."""" Pls dont tell us who we r! let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a Turk whatever others like or not. 

About Aran, as I know we didnt have """"Eyalat Aran"""" in the Qajar era. We had """"Eyalat Azarbaijan"""" and both Azerbaijan rep. and Armenia was part of this big Eyalat as well as south Azerbaijan. Aran was part of this big land. But the important thing is, the name of land is not important here as well, the important thing is the people who live in Azerbaijan rep.( former Aran as you called) are of my race and we r same nation. You may call there Azerbaijan or Aran but the important thing is: """"here a nation live which called themselves Azerbaijani Turks!"""". You may call them whatever you want as well as their land, the important thing is what they call themselves. If they change the name of their republic, will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves """"Arani"""" and start to speak """"Aranian"""" language! which does not exist! 

Ok let's think Azerbaijanis r not Turk, so what they r? Azeri? Ok, let's call them Azeri, what is the next step? You will ask them to forget to speak in Turkish language and start to speak Persian? Or not, speak Azeri lang.? So what is Azeri lang.? where is it? Can you learn it to about 32 million people? let's thing pragmatic as well as rational. Even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically, you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of 1000 years ago nor Persian.

Also I dont rely neither to researches of Kasravi nor Zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. One was Paniranist other was Panturkist. Some of their researches looks really funny!

About the names of Turkish places and cities, I guess you have never ever travell to Azerbaijan. If you were here, you'll see that Iranian government has changed the names during Pahlavi era! Some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example Tabriz has a suburb in Western part of the city called """"Akhmagaya"""" which in Turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place, do u know what is its official name? """"Ahmagiyyeh!"""" the lands of stupid people! All of the Turkish names tried to change to a Persian words which looks verbally simmilar them! The fact is Persian never have been to Azerbaijan. Most of the Azerbaijani names have Armenian or Tat roots not Persian. My believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like Tats, Armenians, and other caucasian tribes lived here and then Turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called Azerbaijani Turks nowadays. They have their own culture, music, dance, cuisine etc. which seperate them form Persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of Turks of Anatolia which believes that they r 100 percent Turk! I told you history is not important than today, the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a Turk. I dont know what they want us to feel in Tehran!

The name of Azar abade gan looks wrong as well. This word cant change to Azarbaijan during history. I guess the word was """"Azar pay gan"""" (maybe) which zoroastrian Persians called, not Azar abad gan which Ferdowsi mentioned in Shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now!

I had a look to your files about vote frauding which I still believe is correct as well. The diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of Iran will give their votes to Ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election, but you know there is unwrittenable rules in Iran which every one know. Whenever some one come and ask me in person that """"do u like Islamic republic, Ali khameni and bla bla bla"""" I will answer """"YES""""! cos I dont want to lose my life! We dont have life guaranty",0
""":Voltaire as an egalitarian is about the funniest thing I've heard in a long time; of course he was not (and harldy any of the Enlightenment philosophes were). Does that diminish his statue as a thinker? Of course not; non-conformity with 21st-century sensibilities hardly matters in any assessment of an 18th-century thinker. As for the discussion of Voltaire's racism/anti-semitism we obviously must apply similar principles apply. Throwing in a few decontextualised quotes about Voltaire's view on Jews and black people to demonstrate that he was a raving racist is simply meaningless. If these issues are to be included in the entry at all (which I doubt they warrant), then surely they need contextualisation. For instance, Voltaire's discussion on Jews surely must be understood in the context of his general account of revealed religion, and must be set in the context of 18th-century censorship (which often led writers to attack the Jews whilst actually aiming at their Christian off-spring). Similarly, Voltaire's views on non-white people cannot be understood outside the context of his general framework of savagery, barbarism, civilisation and historical development. If people started to read Voltaire in such contexts, then they would start to understand that the question of whether Voltaire was a """"racist, anti-semitist, egalitarian, etc.""""? is pretty much meaningless and doesn't increase our understanding of him at all. However, given the above discussion, I sort of doubt whether wikipedia readers/editors understand enough history to appreciate this. In any case I give it a go, by deleting the presently pointless section on Voltaire's views on race ....

"Merge Pooltown 

The way this village was 'articled' was asymetric, with redirects for the hamlets of Kingsbridge and Churchtown, but a seperate article for Pooltown. The Pooltown article said very little that this article didn't, and nothing that couldn't easily be added. So I've merged the two articles, and made Pooltown a redirect.

The one downside of this is that we lose the geo coordinates of Pooltown. However as all the hamlets are within 1 mile of each other, on balance I think we can live with this. The alternative would be to create articles for Kingsbridge and Churchtown, as well as reinstating Pooltown. Both approaches have precedents, and I've done similar myself for other places, so I've no problem if somebody wants to go down that route.",0

 MBT-3000 engine power and numbers

 User_talk:Stpaul#Personal attacks 

I find it absolutely hypocritical that you percieve the French contribution to England as one of oppression and nothing else, whilst including the Irish whom would object to England in respect to the same percieved issue.  You have insulted the Irish by not affording them the same position you afford yourself as regards the French.  You wholly capitalise on your own fantasies and call anybody else's neutrality to be POV-pushing.  You do not believe in seeing that others have equality with your standing, but sure get upset when it is not percieved to have been given you by others.  Oh how democratic and enlightened such attitudes are.  You'd make a """"fine"""" diplomat!  Governmental practices of power delegation vs restriction means nothing in respect to ethnic relations; they exist irrelevantly.  Therefore, your arguments are jingoistic and POV supremacism.   

I am simply supporting the consensus, which is to only include nations of the British Isles. As a matter of fact, I think the Germans are a lot closer to us than the French, but someone else has been trying to argue the opposite and at the same time push all sorts of medievalist, aristocratic fantasies. TharkunColl 

Brittany is not a nation of the British Isles and hasn't been.

You rewrite history to serve your Whig history-revisionist political schemes!  I have no aristocratic fantasies, unlike yourself!  You want the """"Celtic nations"""" to assimilate into the English spectrum and co-opt their identity, the way the French co-opt Roman Gaul as an identity.  Oh, the hypocrisy continues!  You hate the Mediaeval example, but are ardent defender of the New World Order in saying one thing and doing another!  You rewrite history to commit hypocrisy; condemning the actions of one party towards your percieved polity and then adopting such policies towards other ethnic peoples.  Mediaeval my arse; you are guilty of those accusations you level towards the French!  You have no right to talk!

Yes it definitely isn't an ideal source, but unfortunately since these events took place in a very secretive, distant battlefield (Mike Spann was the first US casualty in the War in Afghanistan), the fine details of the event are limited to only a few sources, thankfully an experienced and respected English-speaking journalist was there shortly after events to record them.

The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers (not really a grand final, as it was still part of the regular fixtures), which resulted in a draw, 4.10 (WP) to 4.7 (R) – I'm guessing behinds weren't counted at this stage. Also, I think this comment pretty much confirms it: """"Fremantle supporters will feel very sore at not having any interest in the final match for the premiership. Really they have themselves to blame for the school-boyish behavior they have shown in ignoring the Association."""" Fremantle later challenged Rovers to a premiership decider under any umpire selected except Mr. Croft, which Rovers quite rightfully declined to take part in.

""":::Even during the 1891 census, castes like Vilakkithalavan and Veluthedan were counted separately. 90% of the Nairs counted in 1891 belonged to the Kshatriya divisions. The remaining 10% were caste groups wrongly claiming the Nair status. Moreover, the 1891 census in Kerala was conducted by Iyer Brahmins, who had a deep seated resentment towards Nairs (Iyers were treated much below Illathu Nair and Swaroopathil Nair in Travancore caste system and they were not allowed to perform priestly functions). Since all the original castes composing the Nair supergroup were Kshatriya and none of the historians considered the primary occupation of Nairs anything other than being soldiers, there is no reason to change the introductory phrase. As pointed out in the reference, the Nairs were commonly referred as Kshatriyas (whether it is accurate or not is another question) by historians. KN Panikker, probably the most famous historian from Kerala, calls them """"a Dravidian variety of the Aryan Kshatriyas"""". Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya calls them """"Nagara Kshatriyas"""" in his book  Downfall of Hindu India. The question is not whether the much researched Nagvanshi origin is accurate or not. It is whether Nairs were known as Kshatriya during the last millenium. And the answer is yes, from multiple sources. 

However the caste system is the most complex in India, and this is the reason why Swami Vivekananda called Kerala a mental assylum. In Kerala, the son of a King can never be a Kshatriya, as according to Nambuthiri beliefs, a Kshatriya should have a Brahmin father and Kshatriya mother. This is the reason why the so called four """"Suryavanshi"""" dynasties of Kerala always married off their females to Nambuthiris. These clans were known as Samanta Kshatriya and were regarded as equivalent to Kshatriya by the Nambuthiris. It should be noted that the Nambuthiris considered every other caste as Sudra, even the other Brahmin communities. The pollution time period (pula) gives an indication to this. Nambuthiris observed 10 days of pula (6 days in some places). The caste which is immediate next to them, the Samanta Kshatriyas observed 11 days of pula. Top most ranked Ambalavasi Brahmin communities like Elayathu and Moosad (unlike other Ambalavasi Brahmins like Maarar, these two castes were recognized by the Nambuthiris as a part of Brahmin community) observed 12 days of pula. This means that the position of Samanta Kshatriya was intermediate between Nambuthiri Brahmin and Ambalavasi Brahmin. The next higher ranking ones were some insignificant divisions of local Brahmins like Pushpaka Brahmins, who observed a pula ranging from 13 to 15 days. Higher ranking Chandravanshi and Nagvanshi Nair groups (all of the Samantans, most of the Kiryathils and most of Illathils) observed a pula of 15 days. Lower ranking Nairs (like Swaroopathil and Charna Nair) observed a pula of 16 days, so did Iyers and lower ranking Ambalavasis like Maarars in Trivandrum (In Palghat Iyers never observed any pula traditions and were independent on their own). 

Regarding the claim that people were granted the Nair title, I don't think a sufficiently large number of people belonging to other castes were granted the Nair title. A few occurrences are there in Travancore, where during the 18th century a very small number of Iyers were granted the Illath Nair status. During the 18th and 19th century a small number of Vellala and Maravar people were granted Nair status. Other than that there has been absolutely no """"conversion of caste"""". The Portuguese record an incident, during 16th century when a Portuguese captain asked the Cochin King to elevate the status of some lower castes to Nair, the King told him that even the highest ranking Emperor does not have that power. During the end of 19th century, however as the Nair dominance was on a steep decline, a number of servant castes asked the Iyer census takers to count them as Nair, which they happily obeyed. And for a brief period, some of them even added """"Nair"""" or """"Pillai"""" to their surname, until the Kerala government nullified affirmative action benefits to all those who are having such a surname. These groups came not only from the Sudra division, but also from other divisions. These groups included Brahmins like Maarars, GSBs and Pisharodys (In Travancore, where Ambalavasis are having a lower status), Vaishyas like Chettys (in Travancore) and Arya Vaishyas (in Malabar) and even other Kshatriya communities like Marathas and Bunts.

My work with the current scoring system is to encourage people to KEEP ANSWERING after somebody has got correct, and as the same time KEEP the privilege of the first correct-getter. As you can see, owing to this new scoring system, the amount of answer-scripts have risen dramatically. I wonder if the 1-extra-point system will bring any negative effect to the future competitions. It is because each question carries different amount of points, and the first-answer will lose his or her advantage. Instead, I suggest that a multiplier is to be kept instead of replacing it with an addition.

Also, to encourage more replies, I've also given bonus multipliers to the second and third persons who get the correct answer. So what I think after hearing your opinion is, to keep the multiplying system, but the multiplier may be reduced from *4, *2, *1.5 to something like *2, *1.5, *1.2 (something greater than 1 but not greater than 1.5). Hope to see your feedback at my talk page (click the capital letter C in my signature will do ^_^)",0

Thanks, a separate sentence is an excellent idea, but we will need reliable sources for it. Rather, than tag bomb the sentence, I'll do it here:
""""typically in education""""
""""everybody knows"""" (students are included in """"everybody"""", but they don't know """"the other kind of numbers"""")
""""natural numbers  counting numbers"""" (natural numbers with or without zero?)
Why was the term """"counting numbers"""" introduced """"circa 1965""""? (per Merriam-webster.com)
At what educational level is the term """"counting numbers"""" replaced with another term?
Sourcing ideas include books on pre-algebra and mathematics curriculum standards.

"I was motivated to add value to articles. Then a cadre of fascist, self-important, imperious, asinine pricks took it upon themselves to systematically target my contributions, which were well withing guidelines and certainly along the lines of the 1000's of cultural references in Simpson's articles. They reverted my contributions, deleted my hard work, gang edited my stuff, refused to compromise or in any way work for anything but their own dictatorial will. Now I'm motivated to be as asinine and ignorant as they are. I'm wholesale deleting anything without a source or reference. I'm disallowing references I personally feel are insufficient. Every article locked I feel is a victory, because it diminishes Wikipedia to lock articles, and its due to their actions that they are locked, so I feel vindicated.

Name of Georgia
I recently edited the section about the etymology of """"Georgia"""" to reflect the fact that there is no definitive theory as to the name's origin. My changes were reverted and now the section is back to the version with questionable assertions and weasel words, such as """"probably"""", """"may be"""", """"clearly"""", """"presumably"""", etc. It is not the prerogative of wikipedia editors to create a synthesis of different theories to reach a single """"probable"""",  """"clear"""" or """"presumable"""" conclusion.

"Taiwanese people 

Hi, there's a dispute here involving an anon who is trying to push the POV that the Han Chinese ethnicity does not include speakers of Wu (吳語), Min (閩語), Hakka (客家話) or Cantonese (粵語), with the conclusion being that the Hoklo and Hakka are not Han Chinese. The basis of his definition is genetic: in short, southerners with Baiyue (百越) admixture are not true Han Chinese.

In fact, the entire Taiwanese people article is extremely messy. After several POV-pushing attempts, it now appears to say the same thing three or four times from different angles. The article needs to be cleaned up or merged into Demographics of Taiwan.

 (Removed a fair bit of uncited information about non-notable people) Honi Soit Page 

Hi Andjam,
In order to """"prove"""" who was an editor, all you need are old copies of the newspaper I would imagine, so I can't see how the non citation issue applies here.  
 
I added a lot of these in over period because many of them are notables, for example John Paul Byrne is a published playwright, Trish Pender a published poet and author, Gabby Milgate an actor in Muriel's Wedding and a radio breakfast host, Julia Leigh is a prize winning Author, Anthony Sharwood a senior writer for Alpha magazine, Michael Fullilove is Program Director for Global Issues at the Lowy institute and so on.  

Sould I also suggest that it's also a bit insulting to these people to describe them as """"non notable people"""" on the world wide web?  Working as an adviser to the Prime Miniter (Michael Fullilove) or appearing on the news singing your hit single (Kylie Burtland) is what I'd call notable.

As you'd imagine it will take a bit of time to cite of all these, but I included them because someone pointed out we needed more history.  I don't care either way but I did put a bit of work into the research so...""",0
"""I'm concerned about how problems are being """"addressed"""" here.  Jza84 summarized what this page is merely about (""""merely about how the UK is subdivided"""").  There are two problems  with Jza84's sumarizing language and overall conception of this page.  First, in terms of dividing territory geographically, there is no """"merely"""" involved.  Territorial division is a serious and often deadly issue.  Moreover, Brits tend to be more tolerant of the mixing of cultural, ethnicity, and legal issues because they live without a written constitution.  Jsa84 could learn from this attitude.  The second revealing problem with Jsa84's language is that Jsa84 underscores geographically as if this modifier is going to clarify anything. The discpline of geography is made up of several branches and, until you specify whether you mean political geography or other kinds of geography, you haven't resolved anythingyou haven't even begun.  This page is one of the more inconsisent pages available, and not just internally, but in relation to other pages that deal with consitutional and cultural issues in the United Kingdom.  I recommend that Jza84 begin to accept the help of others in the Wikipedia community.  Otherwise, these pages will continue to look confused.  Dylan Hunt

3. they watched the Romans building a bridge and then they ran away? Dont take it personal, but this article isnt about Britain - witch was invaded as Gallien was. The Romans where overruled by trying to invade """"Germania"""" more than 3 times. The building of the colonies Germania magna and Germania inferior was more to make some good propaganda in Rome, cause the main population was there was Celtic, and the Germanic people there where new settlers looking for new ground. 
4. There is no Germany till 1871. Till that days Germany was splitted into 39 states, before 1815 into the unbelievable amount of more than 200 states. The states where fighting more each other than the foreign states, and so every invasion made by foreign nations was made with the help of some German states against some others.
5. What about the 30 years of war 1518- 1548, where the half of the population died? I know that you are obsessed with WWI and WWII but the history of Germany is mutch longer than that.
6. Austria and Germany where part of the holy roman empire of the German nation, and its unhistorical to devide them from Germany till the year of 1871

Godwin devised his Law (and others built on it) with reference to discussions such as the one on this Talk page. Its antecedents lie in Reductio ad Hitlerum, also called argumentum ad Hitlerum, or reductio (or argumentum) ad Nazium – dog Latin for """"reduction (or argument) to Adolf Hitler (or the Nazis)"""" – a modern informal fallacy in logic. It is a variety of both questionable cause and association fallacy. The phrase reductio ad Hitlerum was coined by an academic ethicist, Leo Strauss, in 1953. Engaging in this fallacy is sometimes known as playing the Nazi card. Doing so (that is, playing the Nazi card) destroys one's credibility, which is why you have been patiently advised not to do it. If indeed Patiwat initiated the article on Banjerd Singkaneti, note that he also included the protest of The Embassy of Israel as published in the Bangkok Post. That protest, strictly my POV of course, demolishes Banjerd's credibility. Notice, however, that that is MY POV; others, who prefer not to be confused by facts, would believe that it is the Israelis' credibility that has been demolished. As for your credibility, write now I think you incredibly angry, which is not a bad thing to be, if only you learn to focus it properly. If you do learn to focus properly, then you will find that you and Patiwat are allies opposed to the policies of PAD as practiced in present-day Thailand, without reference to what went wrong in the middle of the last century in the middle of Europe.

Rudeness is two-fold. Kattie90, your very first comments were self-serving ones when you tried to assert that you were an Etruscologist.

The above statements about the essences of Nichiren Buddhism are which sects did what is a partial explanation; it is clear that it was composed respectfully by someone sympathetic to a particular sect, SGI.  SGI has a powerful voice around and world and has historically represented Nichiren Buddhism to important world leaders who sought it's understanding.  There are at least 2 other schools of Nichiren Buddhism: Nichiren Shu and Nichiren ShoShu.  These sects warn of SGI (but do not prohibit) it's practice; many feel that SGI inherently contains certain personality-cult rituals, and too frequently worship President Ikeda (the current leader of SGI) along with Nichiren and Shakyamuni Buddha.  Nichiren himself has said that he was not a Buddha, but an incarnation of Jogyo Bodhisattva.  The path of the Lotus Sutra is the path of the Bodhisattva  one who delays their own enlightenment until all other sentient beings in the universe have been saved from suffering.  Schools like Nichiren Shu do not believe that the priest should not be worshiped, nor the president, only the Dharma, the Wonderful Flower of the Lotus Teaching.

Managua, Nicaragua 
epicenter of crime in Nicaragua

experienced rising levels of violence and criminality throughout 1990s 

40% of all crimes in Nicaragua committed in Managua – half of these reported crimes considered violent

nature of violence and violent crime shifts from political violence and civil war to crime and delinquency 
Pandillas – youth gangs – in Managua

now a prevalent and widespread phenomenon – growing rapidly

currently more than 110 pandillas with approximately 8,000 members  
concentrated in lower-class barrios – poverty and lack of opportunity drive membership  
territorially based in specific neighbourhoods

Lower class barrio in Managua 
Pandillas commit variety of crime, often employing firearms

responsible for disproportionate share of criminal activity

Historical Context

The Germans had bombed many cities and civilian targets throughout England throughout the war, in addition to many other cities throughout Europe in the opening invasions. The British Bomber Command began a policy of Area Bombing, or targeting cities to demoralize the population, disrupt the infrastructure, and as a method of taking revenge for the bombing of British cities. The Nazis were widely popular, and encountered no resistance from non Jews, non Communists, or any other Germans who were not exterminated by the Nazis. The use of incendiary bombs was also similar to the burning of Jews in concentration camp ovens, which the Germans had given their consent to.

The method used is the Algebraic Topology of PDE's formulated by A. Prástaro in a series of early published works on the geometric theory of PDE's and the characterization of their global solutions by means of suitable bordism groups.

In particular in [1] and [2] it is proved the following theorem.

Theorem [Integral h-cobordism in Ricci flow PDE's]
The Ricci flow equation for n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, admits that starting from a n-dimensional sphere S^n, we can dynamically arrive, into a finite time, to any n-dimensional homotopy sphere $M$. When this is realized with a smooth solution, i.e., solution with characteristic flow without singular points, then S^n is diffeomorphic to M. The other homotopy spheres \Sigma^n, that are homeomorphic to S^n only, are reached by means of singular solutions.
In particular, for n belonging equal to 1,2,3,4,5,6,  one has also that any smooth n-dimensional homotopy sphere M is diffeomorphic to S^n. In particular, the case n=4, is related to the proof that the smooth Poincaré conjecture is true.",0

 Referencing 

Referencing on Wikipedia, thanks to its primitive interface, is a pain. There are a couple of ways to do it: one widely-used method is to simply copy and edit references from another article. The Meridian Hill Park article has a start on references: it's got a heading and a {{reflist}} template, so you're partways there already. There are some extant citations in the text, like{{citation |title=Roads to Diversity: Adams Morgan Heritage Trail |url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/AMHT_English.pdf |author=Cultural Tourism DC |date=2005}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id;=799601 |title=Meridian Hill Park: Sports and Recreation Locations in Washington, DC on washingtonpost.com's City Guide |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}. You can see that the references are framed by  (or ) and  in HTML-like markup. You use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once. When embedded in the text they'll cause notes to appear in the References section at the bottom of the page.

In the top left of the edit window you should see a toolbar that has, at the left, a button that says """"Cite."""" Clicking it will show a drop-down menu of citation references for web, news, book and journal references, which then leads to a form that you can fill out (not all forms need to be used), and will insert a formatted reference wherever your cursor happens to be in the text. Often, for book references, you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference, and just say Smith, p. 15 and go on.

My main concern on the tone of the article is the use of intensifiers and adjectives in general, which is frowned upon in encyclopedic style. A certain dryness is called for, but there's an art to keeping just this side of plodding declarative prose. It's an interesting exercise. Perhaps not Joe Friday, more like Bill Gannon. 

Have a look at the citations policy for more: also verifiability and reliable sourcing are important. The policies on no original research is important, since Wikipedia is a tertiary source that relies on secondary published sources.

I'm certain you'll have more questions, please feel free to ask.  (talk) """,0

"Yes, being paid alters judgement. So does joining Scientology, believing in Astrology, being against gun control, being for gun control, or any number of other reasons for advocacy editing. I could make a case for Wikipedia being harmed more by religious or political advocacy editing than by paid advocacy editing (but see below for why I think this might change).
There are however, a couple of things that are special about paid advocacy editing which IMO require extra care.
First, Scientology cannot do anything to suddenly have ten times more followers. They are already doing the best they can and the pool of potential converts is resistant.
Paid advocacy editing, on the other hand, can easily gain as many paid advocacy editors as desired by simply paying more. Think of the difference between getting emails advocating politics or religion vs. emails about online pharmacies. The first is annoying, but self limiting; the second gets bigger and bigger as long as it remains profitable. Our article on Email spam gives numbers like 200 billion spam messages sent per day and 97% of all emails being unwanted. I think Jimbo is right to be especially concerned over something that could grow exponentially.
Second, we really cannot do anything to convince most religion or politics advocates to change their ways other than blocking or banning them, but we can make big changes in how paid advocacy editors operate. If it becomes well known that the advocacy editors who don't edit articles directly but instead make talk page requests get better results and that the sneaky kind of paid advocacy editor usually gets reverted, the customers will naturally go with the service that gets the best results. We can make that happen, but again it takes special care.",0

"The poobotsdam declaration 

We-the undersigned, representing the hundreds of millions of other vandals and trolls, have conferred and agree that Wikipedia shall be given an opportunity to end this war.

The prodigious land, sea and air forces of the undersigned, many times reinforced by their armies and air fleets from the west, are poised to strike the final blows upon Wikipedia. This military power is sustained and inspired by the determination of all the Allied Vandals to prosecute the war against Wikipedia until she ceases to resist.

The result of the futile and senseless Chanting Fox resistance to the might of the aroused free peoples of the world stands forth in awful clarity as an example to the people of Wikipedia. The might that now converges on Japan is immeasurably greater than that which, when applied to the resisting Nazis, necessarily laid waste to the lands, the industry and the method of life of Chanting Fox and Lucky 6.9. The full application of our military power, backed by our resolve, will mean the inevitable and complete destruction of Wikipedia and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Wiki Foundation.
The time has come for Wikipedia to decide whether she will continue to be controlled by those self-willed militaristic advisers (e.g. JpGordon, Durvova, J.Delanoy, jdforrester, Sandstein, OrgangeMike, BigDunc, Alison, RodhullandEmu) whose unintelligent calculations have brought the Wikipedia Foundation to the threshold of annihilation, or whether she will follow the path of reason.

Following are our terms. We will not deviate from them. There are no alternatives. We shall brook no delay.

There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the editors of Wikipedia into embarking on world conquest, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.
Until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that Wikipedia’s war-making power is destroyed, pages in article space to be designated by the Allies shall be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting forth.

Wikipedia sovereignty shall be limited to the articles of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.
The Wikipedia military forces, after being completely disarmed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.

We do not intend that the admins shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon us through abuse of their blocking, checkusering, and protection tools. The Wikipedia Foundation shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies amongst Wikipedians. 

Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be abolished in favour of whatever is lulziest.
Wikipedia shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted. Eventual Wikipedian participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.

The occupying forces of the Vandals shall be withdrawn from Wikipedia as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Vandals a lulzily inclined and irresponsible government.

We call upon Jimbo Wales to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Wikipedian armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Wikipedia is prompt and utter destruction.

"""Age of consent 17-18==
I wanted about six months ago to add info that many states, at least 19 if I'm remembering correctly, have an age of consent of 17 or 18 but Flyer22 would not let me include the info next to the age range, only as a footnote. I think the information is important because simply stating the age range is 12-15 gives a misleading impression that all 50 states allow children 16 and older to consent to sex with adults, which is not true. Is it at all possible that the statement that not all states have an age of consent of 16 can be included next to the age range. I'm not edit warring I'm taking it to the talk page to see if I can get consensus.   
This matter was already settled after extensive debate. Refer to #Age of consent above. It wasn't about me not letting you do anything. It was about WP:Consensus being against you, and for valid reasons. I'm not about to repeat much of what was stated by me and various other editors on this matter. Furthermore, the lead is currently very clear that it's only the age range on the show that is designated as 12-15. I compromised more than enough with you on this. The current wording isn't even the agreed-upon consensus wording, but it is wording that I compromised with you on upon your return to Wikipedia. And once again, the lead of this article is not for mentioning age of consent laws, and your concern is no longer valid since the lead explicitly states """"on the program, the range is usually ages 12–15.""""   
It would only take one sentence to clarify that issue, its not like it would take a paragraph. And Malke's whole point against me was that the edit gave a false impression that the age of consent in the USA is 16. So I think its worth having one sentence clarifying that. Also I disagree that the lead should not mention laws, because the only reason the show exists is because these men are breaking the law.   
The issue is already clarified. And, like I stated, I am not repeating to you what was made explicitly clear to you by me and several other editors last year. Oh, and WP:LEAD is clear about what the lead should mention. Off-topic material is not a requirement or advised. And age of consent laws in the lead is off-topic.   
And changing the lead back to the contested, consensus-violation wording, which I again reverted, after you've repeated your contested view on this talk page, is something that you should never do. You should wait until the discussion is over. And if you see that the discussion is over, and you still haven't gotten your way, then too bad. We go by consensus when there's been a dispute that couldn't be settled between two or more editors, and consensus is clear on this. Do you think I'm suddenly going to agree with you? That is not going to happen, and, as stated, I've compromised with you enough on this. Your recent restoration of that contested edit is exactly what I was complaining to you about when I mentioned how you revert and revert, hoping to tire out the opposing editor and/or have the opposing editor finally agree with you. If I were to ask the Wikipedia community to weigh in on this again, the outcome would be the same. No doubt. So you need to move on from this discussion. See WP:DEADHORSE.   
I restored the note in a better way, """"age of consent varies by state"""", because it does. And this way it doesn't look like its editorializing, unlike the previous """"it should be noted in some states it is 17"""". The age of consent in Virginia is fifteen, for example, at least according to Hansen's book.   
Yes, you added the note in a way that still violates WP:CONSENSUS on the issue. Thank goodness Zadignose stepped in and reverted.

is entirely unambiguous, and requires no qualification or elaboration. It doesn't need any explanation of the various state laws regarding age of consent, as it doesn't even mention such laws, which seems entirely appropriate to the articl",0

Cu, I do not think it's so much a matter of translation as of using different recensions. All other things being equal we should use newer versions (though many contain commentaries so can be construed as secondary). But Bede seems to have been messed with over the years. Particularly, you'll find there appears to be a lacuna in all versions - Bede promises to return to """"the siege of Badon-hill, when they made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years after their arrival in England. But of this hereafter."""" And """"hereafter"""" never comes: what comes is the only loss of temporal sequence in the book. So this is why comprehensive secondary sources are needed. Anyhow, I am not going to try to impose some novel reading but on the other hand I accept that Martin of Tours was a soldier, Germanus led an army, Patrick's mission was accompanied by a Saxon fleet (Annals of Ulster) - I do not want to suppress this information in the service of an unrealistically sweetened picture of these Christian saints either. So this is why I am wary of the idea that those British bishops were dedicated to """"Romanism"""" - in fact the British invented all this """"Joseph of Arimathea"""" stuff purely in order to claim an apostolic succession that did NOT involve Rome.

Feel free to discuss your questions directly with me by email if you like (wiki lets you do this by clicking a link). I used a variety of references obtained via Google, which I did not list in the article (I probably should have).

I have doubts about some of the information that was there before my changes and that you have restored. In particular, I believe that Skene's glands are not the same as the G-spot, and are not located there.

"""

As I'm sure many of you have surmised, there is something going on behind the scenes to which most editors of Wikipedia are not privy. My purpose here today is to expose it. In doing so, you may be tempted to minimize the problem by vilifying David Gerard or Carbonite, but their actions are only part of the surface manifestation, and penalizing them will only accentuate the dilemma. Finding fall-guys to punish will not fix the problem because the underlying problem is the system of punishment.

Systems of punishment
On Jpgordon's talk page, we see Carbonite punish the administrator with a forced """"time out."""" In response, Jpgordon leaves a message on Carbonite's talk page saying, """"Good call."""" Jpgordon's subservience to the system of punishment is directly evident in this example. Methods of indirectly empowering systems of punishment also exist.

We can disagree with Carbonite's methods while enabling them at the same time by acknowledging Carbonite's ability to control our will. But, does Carbonite have the innate ability to control our will, or do we grant him that power? Obviously, Carbonite cannot coerce us without our agreeing to allow him that authority. Our mind is our own, and our will is based purely on the systems we acknowledge.

When we buy into a system of punishment, as many of us have at Wikipedia, we are purchasing the whole package. It come complete with vandals, disrespect, flame wars, and content ultimately controlled by a very few individuals with little or no prescriptive editing experience.

Prescription
Language requires prescription. This is evident with a little thought-experiment involving two extremes. If you could only communicate with words that remained the same indefinitely after they are coined, communication would be entirely possible. However, in the opposite extreme, where official definitions instantly amended whatever meaning every disparate context assumed, propaganda and """"misuse"""" would soon render that language ineffectual.

Within the intended construct of Wikipedia, we don't have to understand how strong singular definitions empower a civilization. The Darwinism of thousands of disparate editors and competing ideas will naturally lead to a prescriptive definition. In areas of Wikipedia where we don't have top-down control of content, this is exactly what happens. Unfortunately, systems of punishment have become the rule at Wikipedia instead of the exception. Our love for this project creates expectations for its potential, but the fear of not reaching these expectations allows others to control us, closes our eyes to corruption and content control, and ultimately destroys the thing we love.

But, I would support linking to those articles once they include significant Asian philosophical content. But, even then, the link should be to the philosophy section, not to the top of the article. I didn't find anything on philosophy or religion in universe or mortality.

"I am always skeptical about these 'naked spacewalks' for various reasons. They say our body is ~70% water, but that does not really paint an accurate picture. The reality is that we are more like soda pop in a bottle, where we have a certain amount of nitrogen, oxygen, and other trace gasses dissolved in our bloodstream at STP. The key here is the STP part. As with a bottle of soda, when the pressure is decreased, the gasses rapidly come out of solution, which is what produces the fizz. Similarly, if your body went rapidly from STP to the vacuum of outer space, you would almost certainly experience a similar effect. To be blunt, your blood would quite literally boil and you would surly die of an aneurysm or internal bleeding from all the vessels which would be breached by the gasses trying to escape. About the closest I've seen to this being accurately portrayed is in the film Event Horizon, where it shows all the vessels on Justin's body becoming visible as they rapidly expand when the airlock pressure is decreased. But still, it does not explain where the gas goes, which is the same problem in this film. It seems wholly impossible to survive such a drastic change in atmospheric pressure.",0

 Dear Shirahadasha, Please AT LEAST consider looking up terms in Wiki itself before you make statements.

There is NO evidence in JEWISH sources that there EVER was a 'canon' in the Christian sense of the word. Most deduction is based on non-Jewish sources and modern academic research. Therefore you can not call TaNaKh a canon just so it can fall into the same definition as Christian works.

"""

(deindent) Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.

The thought experiment is this:

 you have one observer
 The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style)
 The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environment

From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.

This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say """"I am copy 1"""" and copy 2 will say """"I am copy 2"""".

To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).  """,0

 Pro-Gay Bias? 
To be honest, I am not sure I entirely follow. What is exactly is meant by holding a """"pro-gay bias""""? That I am in favour of homosexuality? This seems entirely nonsensical, and indeed strictly speaking to be """"pro-gay"""" would mean you hold that it is a superior sexual orientation that all should aspire to. To be quite honest, I think the whole notion of a """"pro-gay bias"""" is entirely homophobic, and used to paint those who accept different sexual orientations in a manner that suggests they desire to promote homosexuality. Clearly, the article has a distinctly homophobic bias. It portrays a homosexuality as abnormal and deviant, homosexuality as a """"post-industrial"""" cosmopolitan lifestyle, and homosexuality as the social norm. These are all strongly homophobic POVs which are rejected by those who accept different sexual orientations (i.e., the majority of society in the West, and specifically progressives and social liberals). Those who hold such beliefs are indeed social conservatives who defend traditional morality and particularly heterosexual relationships. Stating the views of social-conservatives as objective facts, without even engaging with the beliefs of the majority of society who accept homosexuality, is clearly and irrefutably extremely biased. As is the implication that homosexuality has supposedly """"increased""""  as a result of the  """"modern urbanity of the post-industrial age"""", when in fact it is irrefutably due to the increasing acceptance of people's sexualities that has occurred in Western society in the 20th Century. On these grounds, I intend to revert this article.  10:00, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)""",0

I've worked in digital cash for about 20 years; it's clear that digital bearer token money (i.e. Chaumian blinded money) could be used to represent arbitrary assets.  There is a difference between distributed and centralized systems, and right now the only really viable distributed model is blockchain based, but the distinction shouldn't be """"cryptocurrency vs. non-cryptocurrency"""", but """"blockchain-based cryptocurrency vs. blinded token cryptocurrency"""".  They're both distinct from account-based money.

There are ways in which blinded money is actually *more* cryptocurrency than blockchain money  by eliminating the historical record of linkability inherent in the blockchain or account-based systems, blinded tokens are inherently fungible, which supports negotiability and finality.

I'm not sure what the solution is to this article; move it en-masse to """"blockchain currency"""" or merge with bitcoin and then redirect cryptocurrency to digital cash?

I may also include other information, such as how long a person is President for (a term of four years) and then maybe say who has held consecutive terms, who has held office more than once (separately), who has died while in office.

"BringIt

BringIt is a video gaming website that provides “gamers” the opportunity to connect over the internet and play one on one or multi-player tournaments against each other for money. The site was launched in November 2008 by Woodrow Levin.

In addition to the gaming provided, the website allows users to blog, create profiles and write reviews in the forums.  BringIt includes the following platforms: XBOX 360, PS2, PS3 and Wii.  The main page also provides gamers with a list of the games the website supports.

BringIt’s main page allows auto matches or allows gamers to select an opponent who is looking to play a specific game for the same dollar amount.  Players identify each other by their “gaming tag”, an online ID, and utilize their console’s online multiplayer platform or the built in multiplayer function of the game to play each other. When the game is completed, both players report the outcome to the website, or in the alternative result, emails are automatically reported from the game’s End of Game Email Reporting System. Winning players then have their account credited.  

Founder/Chief Executive Officer

Woodrow H. Levin founded InStadium and Riverbank Capital Management. Woodrow has been featured in Media Life Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, and has been a guest speaker at the University Of Wisconsin School Of Business. Woodrow received his B.A. in Business from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his Juris Doctor from the Chicago-Kent School of Law. Woodrow is active in community and charitable organizations including JUF, Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation and most recently was on the executive committee of The Chicago Green Tie Ball.

How BringIt Works

All new gaming consoles and many older consoles are able to connect to the internet for multiplayer online game play. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo game consoles all have built in software which allows owners to play online against other gamers anywhere in the world. Each game will then be played through the existing technology of the console or game maker. 

Our Mission

BringIt is an online community where gamers across the globe can play video games for real money.  BringIt is a community of American and International gamers with the ability to play against each other 24 hours a day 7 days a week for real money.

Legal Aspects

BringIt is not in any violation of any United States or International anti-gambling laws currently in place. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that playing video games online are not games of chance; rather they are games of skill. Games of skill are not in violation of the Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2006.  Users are required to be at least 18 years of age. Certain US State laws prohibit skill based game play and these residents may not compete in BringIt’s skill based video game tournaments.

Games which may be played through BringIt’s website for real money include:

Burnout Paradise
Call of Duty 4
Call of Duty World at War
COD4
Dead or Alive 4
Fifa 2009
Fight Night Round 3,4

"Specific points of fact

There seem to be two issues of fact in question:

 Which instruments are correctly called ten-string guitars?
 How many resonances are missing from the six-string guitar?

Viktor maintains that the twelve-string guitar is also incorrectly named, which is the issue on which we first crossed swords. I did not at first understand why it was so important to him, but later I discovered that he believes and argues strongly that only Yepes-tuned instruments and some nineteenth-century harp guitars are correctly called ten-string guitars. Obviously, if a twelve-string guitar is validly called that, then for example a baroque guitar might be called a ten-string guitar, and his chance of having non-Yepes-tuned instruments excluded as he wishes is remote. 

So far as Wikipedia is concerned, the main question is this: What should be the scope of the article at ten-string guitar? It seems to me that, under WP:NC, it certainly includes instruments that are built and sold by Ramirez and Bernabe to identical specification to the ones that they built for Yepes, but fitted with a different 7th string (only) to accomodate a different tuning. In fact I would also include any other guitar called a ten-string by its maker, such as the B.C.Rich Bich 10. And if we include that, then where do we draw the line? Wherever that might be, it won't be where Viktor wants it I'm afraid.

So far as resonances go, Viktor has raised this in many other forums. In the ten-string guitar Yahoo! group he was recently asked to list the resonances of the six-string guitar, to clarify what he meant by a similar essay to the one above. He listed nineteen of them!

The point is simply, resonance in this context is not well enough defined to enable us to count them and arrive at a unique answer. Whether we describe the eight missing notes (pitch classes), supplied by four resonant strings, as four resonances or as eight is academic.

Marlow may well be wrong on many other things. We all make mistakes! But this particular issue is a non-issue. Viktor's real problem with Marlow is simply that she is popularising a set of tunings for the Yepes guitar which he does not like.",0

Any recall article shouldn't contain the Aventis buyback, the non-StarLink precautionary recalls by Safeway/Kellog's, as well as all the product refusals.  None of those were recalls. Scandal may be the wrong term but that article can be renamed to StarLink contamination or something similar.

 This is the English version of Wikipedia! Adjust yourself to that fact or go somewhere else. 

Why are English speakers always barraged by racists trying to insist that we use their language? Especially Spanish and Arabic. This is the English version of Wikipedia, and it should be written in English. Why do these racists always try to cram Spanish down our throats? Everyone in the world has a language. Yours is not better than mine. In fact, it is inferior. Speak, read and write Spanish if you want. And use the Spanish-language version of Wikipedia. I don't care. But stop harassing me! This page is not nearly as bad as many others, but I am fed up with this practice. The leading paragraph of some topics is virtually unreadable because a translation has been added for almost every word.

In this article the leading paragraph provides the asinine translation found in this sentence: """"He is the founder of Ricky Martín Foundation (in Spanish Fundación Ricky Martin), a non-profit charity organization."""" To begin with, a moderately mentally-retarded person, who doesn't speak either language, could probably figure that out. There is no legitimate reason for this translation. And why the racial prejudice? Where is the Russian translation? What about German, Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc? The logical conclusion of this absurdity will be that every word of the English article will be followed by its Spanish counterpart. Insanity! We don't vandalize their wiki; they should stop vandalizing ours.

I checked the Spanish-language wiki for this article, and it contains no translation into English. That is appropriate. This version should contain no translations into Spanish, unless the Spanish wiki is shut down completely. Then it would be acceptable to include a few pertinent translations. However, this instance is completely pointless.

Sorry it's not discussing compounded bioidenticals, but the article makes it clear that it is discussing bioidenticals, as does Boothby when referencing the same data. Compounding does not define bioidentical anywhere but in your mind. Yes, they are associated, but that does not mean that they always go together.

First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...

Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. """"The Ten-String Guitar"""" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]

Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!

 Hi . Wikipedia has a strict policy on how we write about living people.

As a result, we have to pay special attention to living people. Anything we write about them can actually harm them in real life if it isn't backed up by high-quality reliable sources. In other words, we need to get the article right. And one important policy we have is that any poorly sourced negative information about living people should be removed. Next time, you need to back up your content with reliable sources—see Wikipedia:Citing sources and Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners for how to do this.

 Theoretical justification for our tax system?

There's a theoretical explanation for the world's current tax system...either that or we're all crazy.

You don't solve that problem by removing the one sentence that does mention the justification for our tax system...you solve it by creating the section that does provide the justification.

Having already read through all those reliable sources and many many many more...here's my take.  This paper...The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure...by Paul Samuelson has been cited over 5,000 times.  It provides the definitive theoretical justification for our tax system.  Samuelson's argument was that the benefit principle had a very limited scope because of the preference revelation problem...a problem which tax choice effectively solves.

Xbox One gets to know you. It learns what you like and what you don’t. And brings it all together on your own personal home screen. And because every Xbox One comes with Kinect, it responds naturally to your voice, movements, and gestures.  The Xbox one kinect can scan through clothes to gain information about your muscle tension and reflexes for a seamless gaming experience.  The kinect sensor detects when you are smiling, crying, angry, or bored. Every detail of your face is recorded to gain an insight into your likely mood. Even your heartbeat is measured and your motions can be seen in the dark. 
I've worked on several versions of this, and our self titled """"Edit Dictator"""" has been telling me it is not neutral or that I am implying something. Then he changes his argument to saying that I am duplicating information; How is information duplicated when what I add is not there in the first place?

Spread the word; Bias is used to remove pertinent information, Dissent/Criticism is silenced, And you are told that you are the one not being neutral when adding to the article.

 see http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html exposing Wikipedia's lying liars & their lies 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

""""Son of Perdition"""" edit=

The concept of the Son of Perdition (also called """"the beast that goes into Perdition"""") is used in the Bible in three contexts, forming a triunism (or """"trinity,"""" or typology) of three potential references.

First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes as per the Book of Daniel.

In Revelation, John borrowed the """"Son of Perdition"""" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to """"the star that fell from heaven"""" by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. The Greek name is """"Appolyon,"""" from the Greek root word """"apolumi."""" It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation."""" The Hebrew name is """"Abaddon,"""" from the Hebrew root word """"'abad,"""" which means the same thing as the Greek root word. In the Book of Daniel, the interpreter says that the eventual destiny of the """"great beast"""" is to be """"destroyed"""" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (i.e. hell).

Given that many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt, they would say that the reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying """"Theos Epiphanes"""" (God manifest), etc.

Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot

In John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the """"son of perdition"""". The New International Version translates the phrase as """"the one doomed to destruction."""" D. A. Carson suggests that this verse refers both to Judas' character and to his destiny.D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Leicester: Apollos, 1991), 563. The phrase is also used in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, where it is equated with the Man of Sin.

Third frame of reference: Some future figure.

In <>, Paulwriting well after both Jesus and Judas had come and gone to their respective destiniesreferred to """"the Son of Perdition"""" in some future sense from the point in time in which he wrote his epistle. Likewise, in Revelation <>, John refers to """"the beast that goeth into perdition, presumably in reference to the same passage in which he equates the Hebrew and Greek names for """"the star that fell from heaven.""""

The following statements are archetypal, and do not reflect every possible variation of belief held by individual religious institution or persons.

Various sects of Jews and Christians, as well as secular historians and critics would acknowledge the use of the phrase """"the Son of Perdition"""" or """"the beast that goes into perdition"""" in one or more of these three frames of reference:

Jewish Reconstructionists and some historians and critics would acknowledge the first frame of reference, as they hold that the book of Daniel is strictly Jewish apocalyptic literature.

Jewish Messianists and Historicists [see Jewish Eschatology], and some historians and critics would acknowledge the first and third frames of reference, but not the second, as they do not believe Jesus is the Messiah.

Christian Historicists, Dispensationalists and Partial Preterists, Messianic Jews, and some historians and critics would acknowledge the second and third frames of reference, as they teach two advents of Jesus Christ. They may also acknowledge the first frame of reference as a typology.

Christian Preterists and Idealists would acknowledge the second frame of reference, and possibly the first frame of reference as a typology, but not the third, as they do not believe in a future fulfillment of prophecy.

A Triunist would recognize all three frames of reference.""",0

Firstly, I have to point out that academic presses have never stopped rolling regarding Northern Ireland and Irish/UK politics. As I say from time to time, printing presses by and large print round the clock, esp 'academic' ones. If you can find them, you will have a pool of scores of thousands of sources on the subject, saying pretty-much whatever you want them to.

Secondly, to give quotes that follow the sovereign-only interpretation of 'country' is simply misleading people. Not everyone follows that strict meaning of the term. By the standards of these quotes, Wales, England and Scotland are not countries either. You can't have it both ways.

You say of calling Northern Ireland a """"country"""": """"It would cause uproar, not only among nationalists but among different strands of unionism in Northern Ireland too, and would be very much contrary to the supposed spirit of the """"new Northern Ireland"""". It is this highly politicised tone that I am objecting to. Where do British Unionists object to NI being called a """"country"""" in the sense of Wales et el? When you say """"the supposed spirit of the """"new Northern Ireland"""" you seem to be essentially claiming that the new Northern Ireland is more a part of the Republic of Ireland than in was before. The reality is that NI is now less part of the UK, and less part of the ROI. As I write, the episode of 'Coast' on Northern Ireland is on TV, and it is just reminding me of how the NI article is Wikipedia's most shamefully negligent article: something I proved with examples over a year ago. It is bereft of locality and positivity. The more recent generations in NI expect a country to grow up in, not an abstract story, or a 'nowhere place' - they have one in every needed sense, except the minds of those who need to put their on need and idea of nationalism first.

"Pind Bainso 

Sorry if my reply was late.
As for your question, Pind Bainso is a Bais Rajput village and i counlcude this from solid knowledge on whom it was named after: Baba Bainso, a Bais Rajput Zimindar who first took his fellow tribesmen from the areas of Baiswara (Awadh) and Shalikot (Sialkot) to the hills of Punjab and all areas of Kashmir to trade in land and for other economical benefits.

The Bais Rajput of the Hills of Punjab and of Kashmir (all inlcluding Azad) are the generations of Baba Bainso and his tribesmen who first settled in Pind Bainso (and eventually also broke off and moved on to spread). It is basically the headquarters of the Bais Rajputs of the area.

The story of Baba Bainso and the Bais Rajput of the region is recorded in the book of Dogra Raj. (I could tell you the story if you'd like )!)

The second evidence is the old Dhangar migration to Kashmir from which Baba Bainso was the ambassador of the Bais Rajput tribe (also a Dhangar clan). We're talking practically around the time that Islam reached the shores of India, so maybe a thousand and couple of hundred years ago! At the time the Bais Rajputs in pretty much all areas they where spread out converted to Islam. This too is recorded in books and is citable.

The third evidence is that my (now brace yourself!), Great, Great Grandad (wait, did i get that right, my grandads grandad...:S) hails from there! He himself (Baba Bagh Bainso Khan) migrated to the masses of land that was inherited by him and started a new village nearby to Pind Banso.

Lol, i hope that clarifies that Pind Bainso is a Bais Rajput village. I am 100% certain. Confusion occurs when Bains Jat (whos history is another story) claim such things to associate themselves with Royal Rajput lineage.

If you don't mind me asking, what clan/caste to you hail from yourself and where from too? Iv'e seen your'e very active in editing the Bais Rajput page and that too with information i can not dispute!

Hope that helped! =)",0

 V is not equal to IR
Facts:

1) In chemisty the number of electrons leaving a mass is determined by the voltage Source: chemistry textbook 
2) In induction physics, the current is determined by the number of coils in the winding source: physics textbooks 
3) In circiut theory the current is determined by the load Source: also physics textbook 
4) these three things are all different 
5) In the power industry, there is also something called """"current draw"""" which is a current not determined by the load but the power supply Source: Con Edison training manual 
6) All of these things with the exception of 5 are excepted theories of science that contflict with the electricity theory
7) The units for charge are wrong. The 4pi that is in F = q1*q2/(4pir^2). the 4 pi is found experimentaly but is from the units.

I find that most circuits textbooks don't even talk at all about any scientist. Many of whom pointed out alot of these things
What I demand:

1) A scientific presentation of electricity theory that uses the scientific method 
2) A list of people in the scientific community who actually accepted this (and hold electrons to be a fact and more than a theory), and on what basis of the scientific method did they accept it.""",0

"""Student essay editing...==
Andy, if you are so keen, then you are encouraged to make the improvements.  These contributions are inferior in many ways as is being widely discussed not only by myself but others.  The rest of us have day jobs, so limited time to contribute.  As you probably know from your teaching experiences, repairing student essays take hours of effort and time.  Sincerely said, I just dont think that these unsupervised contributions from students are of the technical or stylistic standards we are accustomed to in Wikipedia.  The graphics are copyright violations, the article are often violate WP:NOTTEXTBOOK and are preachy or making value judgements.  The referencing ignores WP:SECONDARY.  If you find these massive additions, salvageable, then you can join the completely absent instructor in editing.  We really hope that you can help with content!    
I find your mass removal of good faith contributions by new editors, and your repeatedly pejorative descriptions of them, both outwith the spirit of Wikipedia (WP:BITE, WP:AGF), and disruptive (WP:POINT). If you are too busy to make fixes, that's OK, you are not personally required to do so - just leave the material for others to fix.  (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 
As I have already indicated, at that stage in my traiing would have submitted similarly awful essays. So my pejorative comments are directed at the so-called ambassadors-coordinators-instructors who foster and protect such inappropriate and poorly crafted content.  Like you, they are waiting and praying for someone with writing skills to intervene.  But as you're discovering, determined mediocrity can be difficult to rectify within the fringes of Wikipedia.  Looking forward to your help with editing these and other articles.   
Those people may have been your intended targets, but that's quite clearly not the result you achieved; here as elsewhere. And no, I do not pray.  (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 
There is no result to be achieved ... the students dropped their essay bomb on Wikipedia and got their grades.  The ambassadors-coordinators-instructors are flush with approval that they are """"encouraging"""" and """"nuturing"""" and being innovative in their engagement of Wikipedia.

First off HESA is not merely """"some 3rd party statistics society"""", it is the recognised main source of data about higher education in the UK. And it gets its figures from the universities directly (with clear pro forma) - the differences between the HESA tables and the respective university publicity (Oxford is not the first institution where this query has been raised) are primarily down to how things are counted, including extra-mural students and whether part timers are counted per head or as a fraction (and more minorly over when in the year the figures are for). They're certainly not counting staff or academic departments. You may have a point about using a different HESA table but it should be standard across the board for UK universities for consistency and comparison - if we let each university article pick whichever table fits local impressions best then the information will be less useful overall.

"""==Expanding sections==
Hello, I was wondering if there were some users out there that could maybe assist with the expansion of this Kingdom Hearts article. I've been spending the past week trying to cite and expand sections as best I can, but I've run into a few walls that I was hoping others might be able to help with.

The development section is missing information on any actual development of the game itself. There's some info in the Kingdom Hearts (series)#Development section, but it isn't cited. If anyone can find some developer interviews about the game that could be sourced, that would help expand that section.

The manga section is missing information on the Japanese publication/serialization.

There are a few statements that I tagged as citation needed that I wasn't able to find any sources for. Admittedly, I wasn't specifically looking for those information, but nothing came up in my general searches.

I'm currently trying to find the proper in-game dialog to cite some of the information in the setting and story sections. If any body would like to help, it would be appreciated.

One last thing, if anybody can get information from or has the Kingdom Hearts Ultimania, Kingdom Hearts Ultimania Revised Edition, and/or Kingdom Hearts Series Ultimania α ~Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II~, that could help expand and source the """"Development"""" and """"Versions and merchandise"""" sections.

I'll keep trying to find information as best I can, but I'm having a hard time finding the appropriate information in English, and my Japanese is limited. Any help would of course be appreciated, but if the list above can be addressed, I think it would greatly help in getting this article to """"Good Article"""" status and hopefully eventually """"Featured Article"""" status. ( )

GameFAQs has a script and journal text. I can't help you much on the other stuff, as most of the interviews I find are only relevant to the later games and aren't sourced very well. I commend you for your efforts to make a good article.  

Thanks for the game script link, that made getting the dialog much easier than trying to transcribe it from videos. I tired to find appropriate citations and I feel that the general story is cited well-enough, but others may disagree and add as they see fit.I found a little bit of info for some things and added a reference for one item needing citation, but am still looking for the others. After looking at the Kingdom Hearts#Setting section, I think it may need a rewrite. I think the people from the peer review will say that it is too much like game-guide information instead of encyclopedic material. I'll try to paraphrase the information there in a separate edit to make any reverts easier, in case other editors are unhappy with the result. ( )
Great work overall. On """"Setting"""", I wrote that section to emulate the style of Final Fantasy VII's section, but I don't mind your complete rewrite.  

Thanks for the copy edit, I wasn't too happy with the rewrite I did, it looks better now. I edited the """"Reception"""" section to create a table of the ratings so that way they weren't just listed one after another. If others think that it takes away from the article feel free to revert it.I'm thinking of doing a rewrite of the """"Characters"""" section, the first two paragraphs read more like gameplay information. There is also no mention of the villains. I'll do it in a separate edit again, in case it doesn't turn out well. ( )
Wow, finally some work being done. Thanks, Guyinblack25, for initiating this. I've had this article on my """"To FA"""" list for some time but I never really got around to it. Anyway, I think I'm going to give it a thorough copyedit before adding new stuff.  

Thanks. Please do, because I keep finding grammar edits or weird sentences after some of the rewrites I've done, I try to remember to fix them but they slip my mind. If you're looking for new content to add, there is obviously the list above, but I also think the introduction could use some expanding if the article is to make further. After you made your revisions to the article, perhaps we should send it to the peer review to see what else can be done. ( )

Being involved in an edit war can result in your being blocked from editing—especially if you violate the three-revert rule, which states that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. Undoing another editor's work—whether in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material each time—counts as a revert. Also keep in mind that while violating the three-revert rule often leads to a block, you can still be blocked for edit warring—even if you don't violate the three-revert rule—should your behavior indicate that you intend to continue reverting repeatedly.
 
To avoid being blocked, instead of reverting please consider using the article's talk page to work toward making a version that represents consensus among editors.

Um, no they're not? For example, of the 14 citations you've made in the article, 5 of them point straight to the game's official website. Not good enough. Several of the others link to obscure MMPORG-related review sites and fan sites. These aren't the best either.

"""{unblock|reason=The user that reported me made several false claims, such as claims of """"personal attacks"""" regardless of the fact that I have never made any, and """"violating Wikipedia's policies"""" regardless that I have never done so.  He himself has been reported several times for doing bad things like insulting people, and posted directly fraudulent information both to me and apparently to administrators.  I was not given any possibility of replying to the block request discussion, because he also did not link this anywhere on my page and on his page I saw a template (posted to him by a user of a different time he has done this) stating that doing so is required.  Basically, the user who reported me shows clearly in """"bad faith"""". The fact that I am being forced to defend on myself on Wikipedia for 12+ hours is not a valid reason for a block.  No """"personal attacks"""" were made, no """"refusal"""" to do anything was done as no """"orders"""" were given that could be """"refused"""" due to the fact the """"orders"""" did not even happen, and being a victim of others who are repeatedly attacking me and even deleting my replies from discussion pages before archiving, and defending myself from these continuous attacks, is NOT a valid reason for a block.  As for the articles which caused people to attack and harass me, nothing regarding these articles was ever properly done.  No messages asking to discuss it, no polls done to find out which information is correct, no editing done after my edits for the purpose of further improving the article, nothing constructive or reasonable whatsoever, just reverting the entire edit without discussion or reasonableness, lying about the reason for reverting, harassment, and making fraudulent claims against me such as """"adding information without sources"""", regardless of the fact that 1) I did not ADD any information to the article and 2) it is okay to add information that does not have  a source, and most new articles consist mainly, and some entirely, of such information.  Someone wrote something about """"friendly advice,"""" but not a SINGLE related comment was at all """"friendly,"""" and no advice was given whatsoever except for one which was both unhelpful and contained more untrue statements.  Even this administrator is purposefully making blatantly fraudulent statements, claiming that I """"ignored guidelines in regards to my signature"""", regardless of the fact that the one who changed Wikipedia's code to no longer link automatically is not me, nor did they notify me, nor could anyone think of a reasonable reason to do this, regardless of the fact that it has been less then 24 hours since anyone requested that I learn programming code and then re-code my signature to compensate for this flaw, that's right less then 24 hours let alone a reasonable time of 4 months or so (assuming the user has logged in for several hours every day during that time), and regardless of the fact that even in that minuscule amount of time my signature had already been re-coded before he ever did this block.  This shows that the administrator himself is specifically in bad faith by citing an alleged """"problem"""" that no longer even exists.  There is also a log of the LITERAL AND DIRECT EXACT OPPOSITE of the claim of the person who reported me (again, WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME TO REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE MATTER), at the Help Desk page.  I advise that people looking at this do not read that conversation as evidence of replies and such, because several of my replies were deleted before the conversation was archived and therefore it is an invalid archive, BUT it does show the exact opposite of this claim in that I specifically complained about someone for doing that very thing because the conversation between MYSELF AND HIM should be done at only ONE place, and should also be done at one of the appropriate pages, rather then being harassive by using different places as this Administrator is claiming I have done when there is direct evidence that I've done the opposite.  So the main thing being that I am the victim of numerous people attacking me, they should not have attacked me but instead should have done any of the things I mentioned, or some other reasonable thing, rather then reverting edits and then attacking and harassing me.  I did not deserve any such harassment and attacks and do have the right to defend such things.  If I am treated fairly instead then there could be a discussion on the matter instead of repeated reverting without any discussion, then no such people would be """"reporting"""", but, since I did not do the things in the report other then correcting articles, and since the decent reply to correcting articles which someone else thinks are incorrect is not to attack them as was done to me, the block is wrong because things should be differently and because the people who were """"edit warring"""" on purpose were other people rather then myself.

"The Malvern Water cure
For what it's worth, I concur that the Malvern Water article benefitted from the exercise. To me, the best indicator that (User:Jerem43 was acting in good faith on 12 November 2009, with the Talk:Malvern Water#Advertising tag was that it was Jerem43 who removed it following Gyro's efforts. I came to that article late, so wasn't caught up in the earlier argy-bargy (so to speak). But I see that since the efforts surrounding that period, both the article and its discussion page have settled down completely. 

There certainly was quite a bit of reference to the Malvern Water article in our discussions. Mostly this was to contrast two referencing styles and layouts. One 'exemplified' by Malvern Water, and one 'exemplified' by Shakespeare. Mind you, the William Penn article might benefit from the latter style (but not necessarily). I counted 74 individual page citations for Hans Fantel's 1974 book - nearly double that of Schoenbaum (1987) in Shakespeare.

The above discussions highlight another thing which the Malvern Water article exemplifies. How one can sometimes find the solution in the problem. The problem being the criticism, and the solution in this case being to take it in good faith, and see what transpires - in this case an improvement. Of course, this might not always be the outcome. But assuming criticism as being in good faith generally raises the chances of a favourable outcome. Not everyone knows how to constructively criticise - we typically learn that through experience, if we're lucky (in my own life, I'd have handled many past situations differently in light of what I now know). And by acting as if the criticism or editing changes are in good faith, if perchance they are maliciously based, that will become so self-evident that it's impossible for any reasonable person to miss. Even then, what may have started out as malicious may resolve favourably if the other editor gets a kind response. A funny old world indeed, what with that and the irony that the Malvern Water cure still seems to be working its magic!   Wotnow",0

CONFLICT OF INTEREST & NEUTRAL POLICIES OF WIKIPEDIA

Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia  since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..  Does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?  

PS: “Blackpearl14"""" Do you, your friends and family or any contributors, editors, administrators or Mr. Wales or their friends and family own stock within the Walt Disney Company?  The Walt Disney Company page is not neutral, it is a series of promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Many of the other statements on the Walt Disney Company page don’t follow your so-called neutral definition.  Following your own claim of “neutral”, the entire page would have to be deleted per your own standards.  Furthermore, the lawsuit sentence that was placed on it, was exactly as the other statements of “criticism” within the Walt Disney Company page, yet you claim it’s",0

Factionists own the article there. No sense trying to edit there anymore. The lawsuit probably has something to do with it. One article only speaks about one publisher of a book that was printed by several, went to court, and had it's copyright voided. The other article is a fake biography written to look sort of credible on top about the other party in the lawsuit (the party that was sued).

In fact, a book of Lawrence Stone's (as I recall) demonstrates that Lord Burghley put the Earl of Rutland, a royal ward, on his feet again financially through his management of Rutland's affairs during Rutland's wardship (Lord Burghley was a good friend of Rutland's stepmother).  The wardship system was a cash cow for the Tudor monarchy, and although Lord Burghley doubtless profited from his position as Master, he did not take financial advantage of his royal wards.  In particular, since this article is about Oxford, Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford during his wardship.

 I need an advocate and help with mediation 

Greetings,

I need an advocate who will walk me through the mediation process.

I am trying to get the following added to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.  Max Tegark is a renown physicist and a PhD profressor of cosmology at MIT.  He agrees with my addition.

I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.

I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.

Advantages of MWI

If Hugh Everett's theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:

1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, """"God does not play dice with the universe.""""

2. It eliminates the """"measurement problem.""""

3. It eliminates Von Neumann's """"boundary problem"""": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: """"Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.""""

4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.

5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: """"Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.""""

6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, """"[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery."""" David Deutcsh wrote: """". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment.""""

7. Schrodinger's Cat paradox evaporates.

It seems Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle.

 A """"hint of longing?"""", a """"HINT of longing?""""  It's more like an avalanche of teenage angst because your crush won't reciprocate! 

a melancholic song about unrequited love, especially because it’s all crescendo and no denouement: Listeners never find out if the main character actually gets her wish—much less if the person she’s confessing her love to actually feels the same way. “All I Want For Christmas Is You” is a one-sided confession of wants and desires, not a song describing or celebrating a consummated relationship. “Honestly, the lyrics, to me, come off as hopelessly sad,” Williems says.  “I’ve read the critical reception section of the song’s Wikipedia page, and I can’t help but think the critics weren’t really listening. One critic seems to claim there is a ‘hint of longing,’ which might be the understatement of the century.

If you wanted to get real bummed about it, I think the argument could be made that the song is denouncing the artificiality surrounding the spectacle of Christmas,” he continues. “Saying that you are so hung up on the negative of not being with one person on Christmas that you can’t embrace the joy of the holiday is really pretty sad, but also movingly honest for a pop Christmas song.

 Thanks for the compliment! It's true, content is my main passion. I am happiest when doing lots of content creation/editing and community building, and I believe I do my best work when happy, and am least likely to get testy or make rash decisions. I tend to go through cycles in my editing. Recently, there's been a great deal of content creation that interests me, so that's what I've been most focused on. (A major recent exception would be the discussion of image placeholders, which has involved doing a lot of work to try to determine consensus from a broad segment of the WP community.) When I get less inspired on content, I tend to go on Recent changes patrol, jump into an XfD or RfA debate, etc. In my opinion, it is a good thing to have administrators who are heavily focused on content, and make brief forays into administrative duties. I recognize that some hold differing views; to them I would say, it's essential that an administrator have sufficient experience with things like image licensing and fair use, other projects like Commons and Wikinews, deletion debates, mediation, etc. to act accordingly. I certainly feel that I have enough experience with that stuff. I have nominated numerous articles for deletion, using speedy, PROD and AfD procedures; I don't know a good way to assess the results, but my sense is that the most of my recommendations have been approved. I do lots of vandalism reversion, and would estimate that I include subst'ed  templates about 80% of the time. I have recommended the occasional block for stuff like 3RR. I participate in CfD's and IfD's. I'm familiar with lots of criteria (like speedy delete); I would not claim to know any by rote, but my familiarity makes it possible to read up on something and act pretty quickly.

 So, I would make no promises to be the most productive wielder of the mop, but I would make every effort to be well-informed and judicious in my use. I suppose my main use of the tools would to drift over to Category:Administrative backlog at the times that I presently look at recent changes, and do whatever needs doing. -  23:16, 24",0

"You wrote about (elsewhere) about your dream of creating election pages after the election You're anticipating part of my proposed wikiproject (House - 2008).  I'm was thinking that the parts would be something like this:

0 - Create a draft of the project; recruit some editors to do phase 1.

1 - Move REALLY FAST to create campaign articles (template/shell/skeleton/whatever) for all competitive races where an incumbent won or there was an open race.  Copy the info from articles on challengers into the campaign articles.  Then slap redirects on the articles on challengers (if of questionable notability) so that there is no need for AfDs for these.  (Such AfDs are bad precedent, in general a waste of time regardless of outcome, and successful AfDs could kill off source info.)

2A - Refine the phases of the project and what needs to be done - for example, what a really good campaign article might contain (polls, snapshots of campaign funding at various points, results, newspaper endorsements, a good selection of links to local newspaper stories, etc.)

2B - Create campaign articles for all competitive races where a challenger defeated the incumbent. 

2C - Finish the 50-100 campaign articles for 2006 House races.  That might include a rating/evaluation of the quality of each article.

2D - (Optional) - do the same for the 30+ Senate races. (I just looked at the Florida Senate campaign article the other day - except for the polling info, it's devoid of any significant content except primary results.)

3 - Improve the quality of wikipedia bio articles for incumbents in competitive races (defeated or not), winning challengers, and notable but not-winning challengers: good citations, good copyediting, etc., as baseline for 2008.

4A - (Starting mid-2007?) Build a 2008 comprehensive master page, and set up campaign articles for every race expected to be competitive/notable (that is, every race listed on the master page).  Evaluate feasibility of doing transclusions from individual campaign articles rather than updating the master page directly.  (There are both human and technical issues here, I believe).

4B - Recruit editors to take responsibility for maintaining each (individual) campaign article.  Ideally we can find 3 or 4 editors who are (a) local and (b) can work together well, for each campaign (race) expected to be notable in 2008.

 Bioresonance therapy and Scientology 

Hi there

Casting my mind back to January 2010, as evidenced in the diff. I think I wanted to make more precise a previous editor's mention of """"the E-Meter used by Scientology"""" in the Bioresonance therapy article - and so I found the citation which I added, and which as it stands appears to link Franz Morell (rather than bioresonance therapy itself) with Scientology. That """"factoid"""" might live more comfortably on a Wikipedia entry for Franz Morell, but no such article exists... though the article referenced: http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf does provide more detail. (The reference you gave to https://tools.wmflabs.org/cluebot/?page=View&id;=1909882 brings up only a blank page in my browser. If the referenced article http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf does indeed have methodological deficiencies, we can change our article to state that """"Franz Morell allegedly had links with Scientology'...)

A very rough translation of the cited article http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf - based loosely on the translation provided in Google Chrome, looks something like this:

November 14, 2003 III / Dr.HL-se 

Scientology and Bioresonance Therapy

Bioresonance Therapy includes the """"alternative"""" treatment of diseases such as allergies, eczema and asthma and in  """"alternative"""" dental treatment an ever broader space. 
Bioresonance therapy goes back to  an alleged discovery of the in the Year 1990 deceased Frankfurt Doctor and senior Scientologist Dr. Franz Morell. 
Dr. Morell had in the 70s of the 20th century the allegedly """"genius idea"""" of eliminating patients' harmful mood-swings by reflecting them .

[Footnote 1:  Dr. Eva Rasche in a """"MORA Patient information"""" document published by the F. Dermatological  health center Wadern Elvi Foss -  http://www.degezet.de/leistung.htm
] 

Together with his Stepson Erich Rasche, Morell developed in the year 1977 the so-called MORA-therapy and MORA gear necessary for the therapy. 
In just this period of time Dr. Franz Morell was a Scientology activist. 
So founded Dr. Franz Morell on the 12th June 1970 together with six other like-minded people in Frankfurt the Club """"College for Applied Philosophy e.V."""". 
According to the at-the-time built Statute, the Club should exclusively serve """"scientific and research-supporting ends"""" and organize 'Courses for the enhancement of consciousness by practical application of the philosophy of L. Ron Hubbard, known under the name Scientology"""". 
Appart from that,  Dr. Franz Morell co-operated in the year 1975 on the foundation of the Scientology Tranorganisation """"Narconon"""" in Frankfurt. 
Likewise in the Year 1975 was Dr. Franz Morell in the by the Stuttgart Scientology branch issued Magazine College No. 11 referred to as """"for years highly trained Scientologist"""". 
Dr. Franz Morell was, when he made public his method of treatment, since many years an active Scientologist, who openly held L. Ron Hubbard teaching and techniques as an appropriate basis for scientific and educational activity. 
Under the given conditions it appears not surprising that the idea of bioresonance therapy shows parallels to Scientology practices including: While supporters of  Bioresonance therapy believe appropriate equipment can catch harmful moodswings of people and by the generation of corresponding counter-vibrations can weaken or delete them, Scientologists see in so-called engrams a type of spiritual disruption fields, which with Scientology auditing with the help of the bioresonance devices - quite similar to the so-called E-Meter (electric meter) - can be tracked and deleted. 
The MORA-Gerät is still distributed by the Company Med-Tronic Trading Ltd. 
in  Friesenheim. 
Erich Rasche is Managing Director of the Company Med-Tronic. 
In view of the social and family Relations between Dr. Morell and Mr. Rasche one can hardly assume that the activities of the late Franz Morell for Scientology remained hidden to Mr. Rasche.  
The Term """"Bioresonanztherapie"""" was according to the Company Regumed Regulatory Medizintechnik GmbH in Gräfelfing coined by its own executive director Hans Brügemann. The firm Regumed Ltd. markets a therapeutic device comparable to the MORA-gear, called the BICOM-Gerät, which in the words of Hans Brügemann originated """"in collaboration with Dr. Morell"""". 
The two Managing Directors of the Company Regumed Ltd. - Hermione and Hans Brügemann - have been Scientologists for many",0

This protects against assertions that in fact serve hidden agendas such as attempts to sneak in legitimacy for unspeakable perversions like satanism and pedophilia.

Paglia: On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism. 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",0

 Further response from Elonka:  I am in full agreement with Bishonen that some of Castanea's comments were harsh and inappropriate for the page, and was in the process of archiving them to a different location when I was blocked without warning by Admin .  I would ask that reviewing admins make a distinction between my information and that of Castanea (Bishonen herself has muddled her description as to what I said and what Castanea said).  I made no sockpuppetry accusations, and no personal attacks. I am a longtime good editor of Wikipedia with no history of problems except for defending myself from a long stream of personal attacks from DreamGuy.

Celebrity side dish: John Malkovich brushes Bernie Madoff off of his shoulders
Tom Hanks' films are helping us 'Buck' up through tough times
He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw. 
Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence: 
“He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.”
The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols.
A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.”
The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found.
“It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.”
Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ”
The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy.
Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.”
But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”

Is it worth it to mention that, in regard to electronics working after the EMP, there are perfectly valid reasons?

All that works after the EMP are the video camera, the 2 vans, the ferry, and military equipment.
Electronics that are off at the detonation of an EMP are much less susceptible to damage, so it's presumable that the video camera was grabbed after the destruction started and turned on then.
The first van was fixed by Ray, and the second news van was far away from the EMP.
The ferry was also far away from the NY EMP.
Military equipment, whether it was near the EMP or not, are constructed to be much less vunerable to EMP's, so its understandable that they would work.

Nicola Sedda actually has the largest vocal range that I know of which I only remember his highest as A9.

{{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be """"an editor of astrotheology"""" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more """"egregious misintrepretations."""" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia.

That is when an editor:puts together multiple sources to reach a novel conclusion that is not in any of the sources That isn't happening here. There are two sources which each independently put these facts together and draws the conclusion not the editors.

I am not the author of this section but an editor working to resolve the undue problems (which I'm sure you've noticed we've taken steps to remedy) and perceived POV problems; I come with no sympathies per se.  I don't see how this paragraph (after I rewrote it) reflects the author's bias. It (properly) reflects the source's biases which is allowed on Wikipedia, per WP:NPOV:As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints. The neutral point of view policy is often misunderstood. The acronym NPOV does not mean """"no points of view"""". The elimination of article content cannot be justified under this policy by simply labeling it """"POV"""". Labeling this section as having a POV problem is not a sufficient argument.

One good reason would be that it would be wrong, on procedural due process and substantive due process grounds.  Make that two good reasons.  Lionelt has reported 5 """"reverts,"""" none of which hold up to scrutiny.  First revert is actually changing a paraphrase of the source into a direct quote of the source, while eliminating references to primary sources (eg, I Corinthians) bolstering POV arguments of the editor, not relying on secondary sources. 2nd & 3rd """"reverts"""" are actually an accommedation to the removal of the citation of the primary source by moving the table displaying the primary sources including the Corinthians source in context in parallel columns [originally produced by me four years ago] higher in the article to allow readers to decide for themselves what the primary source said]. """"revert"""" 4 eliminate a redundancy in another New testament reference covered by the table as well as an unsourced claim and is not a reversion. """"revert"""" 5 is simply not a reversion, is an attempt to flesh out a paraphrase of a source, from the source, a point which I actually don't agree and it's not my point of view, nor I think the point of view of that person making the complaint.

In addition, the complainant is required to document his attempt to work it out on the talkpage which he has not done. You've tried to resolve this edit war on the article talk page, haven't you?

Diff of attempt to resolve dispute on article talk page: [diff]

My repeated attempts to get other editors to discuss content, talkpages have the perverse result of being used against me.  I used the term, editors, when there's really only one other editor, Esoglou, who is currently under sanction, and who used to be sanctioned under the handle LimA.  Lionelt's involvememnt stems from a cry for allies at the Christiannity noticeboard:
 Origin of the Eucharist 

History2007 has referred above to a past problem with the article Origin of the Eucharist.  The problem is again as acute as ever.  Only two editors are active in opposing the lone editor about whose apparent aims I say nothing.  I would be grateful if editors with greater knowledge than I have about Wikipedia rules would give advice.  One solution with which I am toying is to let the lone editor have free rein, so that nobody then reading the article would take it seriously.    

One thing I am not sure about is this. Does Eschoir have a possible WP:COI issue there? That may be one way to resolve it. As I said before, I have 1,500 pages on my watchlist, so I can not get involved in details there right now, and that is why we need a general 9-1-1 call system or a Mayday button (perhaps built into the WikiProject Christianity banner) as Lionel suggested so editors can be called for help.   
What an interesting idea: add it to the banner. Well, if you like the """"Click here in case of emergency"""" button I just added to the top of this talk page, it should be relatively easy to add the button to the banner. It would take a consensus, of course, and we'd want to coordinate with John's redesign of the banner. – Lionel (talk) 
Lionelt has helped very much, and I express my appreciation.  As for Eschoir, I think he just enjoys stirring others up.  In the past, another favourite target of his was Free Republic (see the archived talk pages).

 Reason for moving title. 

It is mentioned clearly within this article and the scope of the Cholan wiki articles, that the whole of the island except for Ruhuna came under Raja Raja Chola's reign who established a dominion in Polannaruwa called the 'Mummudi Chola Mandalam'(which was an extension of the Chola empire) after he defeated the Kingdom of Anuradhapura.

Rajendra Chola annexed the remaining Ruhuna to the Chola rule in 1017, King Mahinda V was enslaved.

Then during a civil war in the Chola country in South India, Vijayabahu I would ally with the Pandyas and Cheras would rout the Cholan rule and establish a new kingdom in Polannaruwa.

This is backed up by renowned historians within the articles such as K.A. Nilakanta Sastri and George W Spencer in the article itself. The title 'Occupation' is baseless since the territories was incorporated to be a part of the kingdom and administration, and 'Anuradhapura' equally so, since the whole island came under Rajendra Chola's rule(with most of it already being under Raja Raja's).

 Scientists Discuss """"Evolution"""" 

“My attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed. It is not even possible to make a caricature of an evolution out of paleobiological facts. The idea of an evolution rests on pure belief”. (Nils Heribert Nilsson, noted Swedish botanist and geneticist, of Lund University and evolutionist).

“I think in fifty years, Darwinian evolution will be gone from the science curriculum. I think people will look back on it and ask how anyone could, in their right mind, have believed this, because it's so implausible when you look at the evidence”. (Johnathan Wells, 'Icons of Evolution').

“I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program”. (Karl Popper, German born philosopher of science, called by Nobel Prize winner Peter Medawar, 'Incomparably the greatest philosopher of science who has ever lived').

“Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever! In explaining evolution we do not have one iota of fact”. (Newton Tahmisian, Atomic Energy Commission).

“The pathetic thing about it is that many scientists are trying to prove the doctrine of evolution, which no science can do”. (Robert A. Milikan, physicist by provision and a Nobel Prize winner, speech before the American Chemical Society).

“The miracles required to make evolution feasible are far greater in number and far harder to believe than the miracle of creation”. (Richard Bliss, former professor of biology and science education as Christian Heritage College, ‘It Takes a Miracle for Evolution).

“The only competing explanation for the order we all see in the biological world is the notion of special creation”. (Colin Patterson, evolutionist and senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, which houses more than 60.000.000 fossils).

“Evolution is a fairy tale for grown ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless”. (Prof. Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research).

“All of us who study the origin of life find that the more we look into it, the more we feel it is too complex to have evolved anywhere. We all believe as an article of faith that life evolved from dead matter on this planet. It is just that life’s complexity is so great, it is hard for us to imagine that it did”. (Dr. Harold Urey, Nobel Prize winner).

“A growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from the evolutionist camp, moreover, for the most part these ‘Experts’ have abandoned Darwinism, not on the basis of religious faith or biblical persuasions, but on strictly scientific grounds, and in some instances, regretfully”. (Dr. Wolfgang Smith, physicist and mathematician).

“The evolution theory is purely the product of the imagination”. (Dr. Ambrose Flemming, Pres. Philosophical Society of United Kingdom).

“I have always been slightly suspicious of the theory of evolution because of its ability to account for any property of living beings. I have therefore tried to see whether biological discoveries over the last thirty years or so fit in with Darwin’s theory. I do not think that they do. To my mind, the theory does not stand up at all”. (H. Lipson, “A Physicist Looks at Evolution“, Physic Bulletin, Page 138).

“The talk of evolution is sheer nonsense not founded on observation and wholly unsupported by fact. This Museum is full of proof of the utter falsity of their view”. (Niles Ethredge, British Museum of Science).

“(Evolution is) a great cosmologic myth of the twentieth century”. (Michael Denton, molecular biochemist, ‘Evolution, Theory in Crisis’).

“The evolutionary establishment fears creation science, because evolution itself crumbles when challenged by evidence. In the 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of public debates were arranged between evolutionary scientists and creation scientists. The latter scored resounding victories, with the result that, today, few evolutionists will debate. Isaac Asimov, Stephen Jay Gould, and the late Carl Sagan, while highly critical of creationism, all declined to debate”. (James Perloff, ‘Tornado in a Junkyard’, This book was published in the year 1999, Page 241).

“Evolution is faith, a religion”. (Louis T. More, professor of paleontology at Princeton University).

“Evolution is baseless and quite incredible”. (John Ambrose, ‘The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought’).

My concern about your username (Heavybuddha)

Hello, , and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at WP:RFC/NAME. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you again!   Talk   """,0

Ugly Personal Attacks - You Approve??

""""Good Morning, Philippe. The post above yours, by LoverofArt, is typical of his posts in my direction. An ugly personal attack, by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization  the National Civilian Community Corps  by posting false and misleading information at the Wikipedia website.
If your / Wikipedia's best idea is that what should happen next is that I enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person, hoping to reason with him/her, while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes, then your processes leave a great deal to be desired. A responsible adult  a real Editor  should have interceded long ago.

He/she and the others working over the NCCC text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase """"According to ___,"""" does not belong at Wikipedia. As I read it, there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation. Why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims (as if fact) without reference to the source in its text eludes me. It would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement, which is obviously not the case.

I appreciate Wikipedia's effort to provide freely accessible information to the public. I am not impressed, however, by the response to gross errors made at the Wikipedia site. Your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like.
A pretty sorry performance, which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues I raise or the attacks on me.

Focus on Search Box When Main Page Loads
Is there any way someone can change the main page so that when it is first loaded, the insertion point is already blinking in the """"Search"""" box (like, for example, when you go to Google).  It would mean that the moment a person loaded the page, they could type what they're looking for.  It's an encyclopedia, so the search box should have a little more priority, don't you think?  The fact that it takes an extra click to get to the search box suggests that the main page is primarily a """"click-thru"""" page to other content.  I may be wrong, but for me the main page is primarily where I start searching (by using the very tiny search box that I have to first click in).

 Really tangled paragraph 

The conception of a right to something that implicitly creates an obligation on someone else to provide that thing (a positive right) is widely challenged.  You can not enforce your wish for something (under the auspices of a right) if it implicitly constitutes an obligation on another to do something for you.  However, one person's right to something creates a negative right in that you have the right for that thing not be interfered with by another, and that other is obligated not to interfere with your right to it.  The obligation test is widely used to determine what constitutes a right.  To illustrate: You have the right to own an axe, but you do not have a right to an axe.  If you do own an axe, others have an obligation not to steal it.

I've got a post-graduate education, and I had to read practically every sentence of this paragraph more than once to parse it. And it has a lot of problems beyond that:

 Normally we avoid second person. I don't see why it is needed here.
 """"widely challenged"""" with no citation: I have almost never seen this challenged except by liberatarians. I'm pretty confident that most people, for example, consider that the right to life extends to the point of creating an obligation for a government or society to attempt to rescue victims of a natural disaster. I would doubt that there is a """"widely"""" held belief that a person dying of thirst while someone next to him had abundant water could be reasonably expected to die respecting his neighbor's property rights.
 By the second sentence, this has switched to imperative (or, more precisely, hortatory) mode, which is entirely inappropriate. It becomes a statement of a narrowly libertarian conception of rights, in the article's narrative voice.
 Again """"widely used"""" without citation. I cannot name a country where this, in general, has the force of law. Certainly not the U.S., one of the more libertarian countries in the industrialized world, but one which recognizes a right to a publicly financed primary and secondary education.

In short: poorly written libertarian cant.

You've made three mistakes:
 
Is the version I'd reverted to - unstable? On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable?
Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it?
The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. If you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page.

Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if I """"continue to revert"""", also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if you """"continue to revert"""".
If you continue to both - remove a consensual chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus.
Anyways: due to your claim about irrelevance, I will add to the (stable consensual) chapter - some clarifications, to make sure that every reader (including User:Basket of Puppies) understands its relevance.

Unilateral moves can trigger edit wars, break links and cause a lot of problems. Please stop unilaterally moving pages, as you did with Kim Jong-il, and follow the correct procedure.

I have reverted nationalist anti-Soviet propaganda, mass deletion and removing the mention of Nazi collaborationist war crimes in Participants in World War II about once a day. I have been blocked in circumvent of the rules by a POV admin. The article should be restored to the pre-edit war status

Nixer, you reverted that article four times. I have blocked you for only 24 hours, although your repeated 3RR violations would usually warrant more, as would your """"POV admin"""" remark above.  (T) 

Taking no position whether Nixer  deserves a block for revert warring, I must note that 4 reverts accumulated in 36, not 24 hours as per this. Staying under 3RR is no entitlement in any way and general revert warring is subject to admin's discretion blocks. However, in such case the admin should be uninvolved, unlike user:ProhibitOnions who was one of the editors who reverted Nixer. Again, I take no position on whether Nixer should be blocked for RV warring in general, just noting that technically 3RR is not there and blocking by admin who participates in article disagreement is highly inappropriate in such case.

All this aside, Nixer, you should cool down finally.  

Three of Nixer's reverts were within 24 hours and the fourth was the following morning, which I reverted, but subsequently restored.

"The old taxobox template? 
Hi!

I know you are busy with the cactus, but I hope you can help me out. On the Norwegian Wikipedia, we have since the beginning used a taxobox without ranks. This has been due to early influence from a single editor, which has since gone unchallenged until a year ago or so. Now, we finally have the consensus to change over to a ranked system, the only problem is that there seem to be no-one capable (or willing) of doing the coding of something as complex as a taxo-box. The bio-editors over at Norwegian WP are just just a handful of people, all of which seem to be as techically inclined as yours truly.

So, I had the bright idea to import and translate the old (non-auto) taxobox from English. I don't know anything about coding, but since the ranks are in latin, I suppose it should be possible to understand what bits need translation. The only problem is, I don't know how to find the code.

 Request regarding current RfAr/Clarification 

There is an open Request for Clarification regarding a sanction decided at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Abd-William M. Connolley, see live link, or permanent link.

 is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. I agree with him, and, unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised, I support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. My reason for this: it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at RfAr/Clarification, and that I was blocked while this request was pending, for comments made in the request itself, is an additional impediment.

There is no need for extra debate or argument. I have stated that I am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which I interpreted the sanction, pending clarification by ArbComm. So the status quo is that the restriction is tight, though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. I do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits, and I'd argue that he did so consider. I accepted Sandstein's decision (""""clarification"""") as a neutral administrator, pending ArbComm review, not Future Perfect's who was already involved, and I had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.

I will continue to respect Sandstein's tightening as standing and binding on me, and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated, and it did permit legitimate comment before ArbComm, when I am an originating party, as is normal. Normally, I can, having filed, respond there to comments from other editors, also made there, which is what I did. ArbComm specifically allowed me to originate a case, and if I'm clearly involved as well, I see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.

I will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors, and I will avoid, in such a filing, if it happens, unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. Obviously, if I file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin, I will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required, which would only mention other disputes peripherally, and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.

I hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual RfAr than there has been to the existing RfAr/Clarification, which, as it stands, includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material I filed. It's been pointed out by , with clerk attention requested, and nothing was done. Nevertheless, if the request is closed without action, it's moot. The real point here is that if clerks were following filings before ArbComm, surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved, and possibly the editor warned.   """,0

You can edit WikPedia!

But only if you can suck good cock!

Celebrity side dish: John Malkovich brushes Bernie Madoff off of his shoulders
Tom Hanks' films are helping us 'Buck' up through tough times
He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw. 
Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence: 
“He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.”
The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols.
A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.”
The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found.
“It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.”
Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ”
The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy.
Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.”
But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”

Ethnic Violence
I think the following paragraph should be removed from the article -

It has been suggested that the random violence was a delayed response to crime perpetrated by other middle easterners, such as gang rapes that occured in 2000 and 2002.

My main problem with it is that the claim being put forward is totally unsourced and unsupported. Yes, whoever put it in has provided an article from the Australian as a source. However, if you actually read this article, it doesn't say anything of the sort about the violence being some kind of delayed response to events in 2000 and 2002. In fact, it only mentions rape once. Here is the relevant section of the article -

In an article on this page nearly two years ago (""""Don't turn a blind eye to terror in our midst,"""" January 12, 2004), I argued that the increasing frequency of racially motivated attacks on young Australian men and women - including murders, gang rapes and serious assaults by young men of Lebanese Muslim descent - would rise dramatically throughout Australia. These problems remain widespread and have been documented in the ensuing two years.

So no mention of any kind of delayed response. Therefore, the idea is completely the POV of whoever wrote it, hiding behind a misrepresented source. It should go.""",0

 Legislation: European Union 

 The atricle claims: """"The European Union has ratified a law """"banning incitement to or denial of genocide"""" (both the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide)."""" The source reads: """"The European Union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” (arguably including both the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide)."""" Some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. 
 Let's have a look at the law itself. 
 Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia
 Official Press Release
 Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group.

 Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.

 Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
 As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:
 the commission of genocide is established by an international court and
 the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred
Is the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?   """,0

Well, don't believe it gets better with an electronic system: The rather rare soft skills courses, of which we need 3 ECTS points worth, regularily have about 400 interested people for about 50 or 80 places  you can imagine that it's simply a glorified kind of lottery to determine who gets the points; if you're lucky and hit """"reload"""" exactly at the right time and can enter the course of your choice quickly enough, you're in; at one minute past midnight (or whenever the enrollment starts), all places are gone usually. sighs

The article's current treatment of the cult issue is unsatisfactory. It quotes journalist Ian Johnson at length for his """"common sense"""" argument that Falun Gong is not a cult (""""its members marry outside the group, have outside friends, hold normal jobs...""""). However, it fails to quote any professional cult scholars, like Singer, except to deride their work as """"legitimizing"""" the crackdown. The respect towards the anticult movement within academia—an unclear issue, but continuously repeating that they are an """"extreme fringe"""" does not automatically make it true—is not necessary to have their opinions in the article. The issue of whether Falun Gong is a cult is important to cover from the point of view of studying the media battle between Falun Gong and the outside world. The fact that apologist authors like Ownby are forced to grapple with the cult issue - even if his comments, like Johnson's, are based on personal impressions and not an objective psychological checklist like Singer's - means that the question is notable. BTW, the academic field of religious studies is well-known for its postmodernist defenses of what popular opinion nearly unanimously derides as dangerous cults, like Scientology. Wouldn't it be interesting if someone commented on this tendency as it relates to Falun Gong...   """,0

 Jacob Haun, not a Mormon? 

I am confused. According to this article, Haun was not a Mormon. But in """"The Work and the Glory,"""" a historical fiction series, it is explained in volume 4 that Haun was not only a Mormon but that he deliberately ignored counsel from Joseph Smith to vacate the settlement and lead the settlers to one of the Church's strongholds, such as Adam-Ondi-Ahman or Jackson County. For verification of these facts, see """"Church History in the Fulness of Times,"""" pg. 201. Pg. 183 of the same volume says Haun's Mill was a Mormon settlement established by Haun. With these evidences, how can we justify the claim that Haun was not a Mormon? I feel this needs to be fixed. Thoughts?   """,0

 Analysts concluded that Georgian Buk missile systems were responsible for downing four Russian aircraft—three Sukhoi Su-25 close air support aircraft and a Tupolev Tu-22M strategic bomber—in the 2008 South Ossetia war. U.S. officials have said Georgia's SA-11 Buk-1M was certainly the cause of the Tu-22M's loss and contributed to the losses of the three Su-25s.Georgian Military Folds Under Russian Attack By David A.

This article is now considerably less lame than a month ago. However, the problem I still have with it is that the way the various POVs are presented implies that the fate of the peace process depends on the goodwill of the Palestinians, which appears uncertain, and hence Israel is the victim of their apparent duplicity. Let's be real: Israel is the occupying force here and has far, far greater military might (not to speak of economic power). The Palestinians are virtually mendicants. Hence it is ludicrous to quote Faisal Husseini calling for """"the liberation of all Palestine from the river to the sea"""" without placing it within the governing geopolitical reality: Israel is armed to the teeth, backed by the even more powerful USA, and has between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads. 

Your anti-Israel political rant is of no help here. If you can't be productive, then why are you here? Please do not start a fight. 

I would like to see the material in this article merged back into the parent article under the section """"The Peace Process"""". If that section becomes too long, it then can be spun out in a separate article, such as The Israeli-Palestine Peace Process. The information serves little purpose in its current isolation.

Our limited quoting is well within US Copyright fair use allowances. In fact, for non-profit works, we have considerable more leeway than for-profit works. Again, you are censoring quotes for political purposes. As discussed above, your censorship is not acceptable.  14:38, Jan 11, 2004 (UTC)

User:Antidote keeps quoting NationMaster, which represents an idiotic compilation of facts from Wikipedia (edition several months ago) and other sources, including the Factbook. If one opens Demographics of Bulgaria in NationMaster, one will see the wikipedia article 70 days exactly at the pointn when it was subject to vandalism by an anonomous user who frivolously (ha! it is not only Antidote who does such things but may be Antidote and anonymous are the same person???) tampered with the data from Census 2001.

User:Antidote takes an estimate of the Factbook and calculates on his own ethnic distributions using the 2001 census up to the hundreds!!! How wise that is, my dear, I am thrilled!!! Has the thought that YOU MAY NOT DO OWN CALCULATIONS crossed your mind? Have you thought that ethnic distributions in 2001 may not be valid in 2005? What if the number of Bulgarians suddenly exploded? Or that it suddenly plunged? Ha???

So, the estimate of the Factbook... Some organisation based in Washington makes an estimation without giving any ground for its estimations, without being a statistics organization but User:Antidote thinks this is the best source he could take a 2005 estimate from. Well, the Factbook may be well-publiced but Brittney Spears is well-publicised, as well, and her music is shite. Look at these two links, the first one is the official estimate of Eurostat for 2005  (7,761,000), the other one is an encyclopedia quoting the official estimate of the UN for 2003  (7,897,000). These are REPUTABLE STATISTICS ORGANISATIONS and compared with them, the Factbook is worthless. Other questions, my dear?

As another member put it """"you may indeed be correct. lance's last post was july 5, 2004 and the last post that indicated he was powerbasic support was june 25... also, between march 6 and march 7 of this year lance changed his title from """"administrator"""" to """"member"""". if he is indeed gone i wish him a lot of luck!"""" It seems pretty clear that no one at the time had any idea what happened. But this is irrelevant and I only mention it because Lance provided technical support via the forums (as can be seen by any casual search of his posts). The current levels of participation in the forum by powerbasic staff cannot under any stretch of the imagination be considered support.

Because 30 support posts of any real value in SIX MONTHS cannot be considered support, and there is no eveidence of alleged """"email support"""", my statement that """"little if any real support is offered"""" is valid. Support is a key issue to novice developers and should be clearly represented in the wikipedia entry.

Thank you for helping with the wording of """"there were 8508 total posts, not 8508 requests for help"""". This is perhaps a more accurate statement and as I have said all along I welcome your input. Since we agree on this number, perhaps you can justify your statement of """"18,771 messages in support of PowerBASIC customers""""?

The numbers I quoted are easily verifyable from your search engine. simply type in any of the historical support staff names like """"Steve Rossell"""" or """"Bob Zale"""" under """"User Name:"""", highlight the five forums in which users confine thier posts for help:
PowerBasic Console Compiler

PowerBasic for DOS

PowerBasic for Windows

Programming

Programming the Internet 

then hit search. If you look at page two you will see that posts in the last six months immediatly dry up. 
A grand total of 32 posts from Mr Rossel and 48 posts from Mr Zale.

A quick review of these posts shows that in fact Mr Rossel contributed 18 posts of any significant help and Mr Zale only 12 (leaving aside Mr Zale's recent spurt of enthusaism).

This is a verifyable FACT. Anyone can verify these numbers. This is not my opinion. Even if we include every post made in that timeframe as real """"support"""" we are still only talking about 80 out of 8500, thats still less than one percent! This is a relevant verifyable fact.

Your point 5 contains no references or even vague offers of proof. You mention Microsoft Visual Basic, seem to assert that Visual Basic users should be entitled to support from powerbasic staff etc etc. I am unclear how any of this is relevant? 

It is interesting to note that you use an internet archive to support your arguments about historical posts when is suits you, yet have so far to acknowledge that the post relating to the incompatability of unsigned integers was targeted and deleted. If you statement """"The truth is, we welcome criticism, as it's a key element in the evolution of our products"""" is true, then cite an example from your forums of criticism that has been embraced. 

In fact powerbasic would like to dodge all accountability as clearly demonstrated when this [thread was deleted.]
The user claims: """"This entire issue started when Bob challenged me to prove that PowerBASIC/Linux had ever been announced as """"coming real soon"""" and accused me of lying.
I provided the proof. (Linux is coming soon, and other platforms will follow.)
He deleted my post, banned me from the forum and has now apparently [http://www.powerbasic.com/su",0

 Harry Potter is a Girl 

Dear Jimbo, I posted something here and it was archived because it was viewed that after a 3 day ban I was too expert in the use of WP:XXXX rules to be a newbie. It was said """"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives."""" I don't even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn't know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn't even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it. 86.93.139.223  

So you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them. So while it might be hard for you to believe that someone can read in 3 days a bunch of WP:XXXX rules, it is not impossible. Actually I didn't have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don't bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don't understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn't that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can't read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments. Sorry but this is exactly the reason I contacted Jimbo and not you. Maximus. 86.93.139.223 (talk)  86.93.139.223  

Dear Jimbo, This is a part of a longer post on the Alkaline Diet page called Harry Potter is a Girl. As I am a newbie I don't know how to do links so copied it here.

I can't know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next. I have put it here as I wanted you to know of my experience here at Wikipedia and how after a few days due to repeated WP:BITE I am leaving Wikipedia editing never to return. Because the people between you and me are the problem I thought to go straight to the top. Sometimes the people at the top don't get told what is going on below them. Anyway thanks for Wikipedia.

 David Johnson (footballer born 1976) 

Hi mate, it's odd for me to have to thank you for decimating an article such as you did yesterday to the article on David Johnson (footballer born 1976). Nevertheless, that is what I must do, as I spent most of last night scouring the BBC's archives (using the Wayback machine a hell of a lot along the way) and rewriting the entire page. I wonder if you might take a look at the state of the article as it is now and perhaps give it a new quality rating on the talk page. I was going to do it myself (it's probably up to B-class by now), but I don't feel that's appropriate after I spent the entire night working on it. Cheers. – Jay 
So what do you think it needs now to get it up to GA-class? – Jay 
OK, cheers mate. Thanks for doing the review. – Jay

"Voting

I don't want to see more mutual recrimination and circular argument, since clearly no consensus is going to be reached. I have made a concrete proposal to resolve this matter and I want concrete, non-polemical responses to it. I want particularly to hear from Skyring whether he is willing to submit a policy resolution to go with the one I have written so that people can vote on the two positions.

User:Adam Carr's proposal:

I agree that the above list of statements on this issue does not constitute a vote, and I don't think Jtdrl claimed that it was a vote. Therefore we need to have a proper vote, decide on a position, and then enforce it. I therefore propose a vote (to be announced at the Australian Wikipedians Notice Board and conducted here). The vote should be between two policy positions, one written by Skyring and anyone who agrees with him, and the other written by those who disagree with him.

My proposed policy position is this:
That in Government of Australia, and in all other articles dealing with Australia's system of government, it should be stated that:
1. Australia is a constitutional monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy
2. Australia's head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia
3. Under the Constitution, almost all of the Queen's functions are delegated to and exercised by the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative.
That any edit which states that (a) Australia is a republic, (b) the Governor-General is Australia's head of state, or (c) Australia has more than one head of state, will be reverted, and that such reversions should not be subject to the three-reversions rule.
Edits which say that named and relevant persons (eg politicians, constitutional lawyers, judges) disagree with the above position, and which quote those persons at reasonable length, are acceptable, provided proper citation is provided and the three factual statements are not removed.

Skyring should now provide a summary of his position of comparable length:

And then we can conduct a vote.",0
"I can see it both ways. On the one hand, we can find 2 substantial RSs for every substantial building, if we really check all possible newspaper sources, including trade papers. Sooner or later, they'll all be in GoogleNews/googlebooks; at the very least , for every building erected or planned before 1920. If we're going to hold to the GNG, we have several choices A.  use an increasingly stringent definition of what we consider RSs for WLOCAL  such as requiring regional sources, but that wont have any effect in large cities  B.  Make a special provision about LOCAL requiring more than RSs, such as RSs showing notability in particular ways  C.  Abandon or supplement GNG in favor of distinct criteria that would exclude such articles, such as hotel rating level.  D.   Use combination articles   E.  Accept the articles, but require substantial content F.  Simply accept the articles . G Use a WikipediaTwo or WikipediaLocal project as a supplement to Wikipedia.    

The GNG was originally adopted as a restrictive measure. This is no longer the case. The increase in easily available reliable web information has killed it's usefulness this way. It is now a rule that will increasingly work the other way around. Many deletionists   try to  elevate it into what they consider a basic policy on principles that are not specifically exclusionary, but rely on confusion of WP:N with WP:V ; many deletionists and others think that in principle it is the only logically  defensible way of having a guideline I wonder whether they will stick with it when it yields the opposite result to what they really want, or yield a result that contradicts their own intuition?

What I really want in G, above, a supplement that will maintain WP:V and WP:NPOV and other foundation principles, but not have a WP:N barrier. The inclusionists will be able to get in essentially everything, the deletionists will be able to remove a good bit of borderline content from the present Wikipedia. (and, btw, I do not consider Wikia an equivalent, for even if we had one that did not  fail WP:V and WP:NPO, I remain committed to a free encyclopedia, free in  particular from advertising either in the articles or surrounding them.  

But we have to deal with the present structure and the present question . Whatever may have been said elsewhere which I am deliberately not looking atwhat  Himalayan says above makes sense to me: it is a combination of my choices C and E aboverely on ratings level, and work for better content. Covent Garden Hotel is at present a very low quality articlethe AfD seems based on the possibility of there being a better article. The present one does, in my opinion, violate NOT TRAVEL and NOT PROMOTIONAL. I would have had to support keeping it however, because that is fixable.

There's no need to compromise an article to placate cranks on the Talk page; respond to them on the Talk page.  
There are separate questions:
Why is it called the """"World Series""""? 
Is it justifiable to call it """"World Series""""? 
Is """"World Series"""" meant literally or just a label preserved for historic/traditional reasons?
Regarding the answers:
The answer would appear to be: 1880s hype + 120 years of tradition/inertia.  
The first bit should be in the history section. The reference says In 1884, the Providence Grays of the National League outplayed the New York Metropolitan Club of the American Association in a three game series for what was originally called """"The Championship of the United States."""" Several newspapers penned the Grays as """"World Champions"""" and the new title stuck. 
It would be nice to cite an 1884 newspaper saying something like """"The Grays are now the Champions of the United States; indeed one might well call them the Champions of the World."""" 
""""the new title stuck"""" is rather vague: did it stick instantly and unanimously? Looking at the contemporary match programs on baseball alamanac, 1911 is World's Championship Games, 1912 is World's Series, 1930 is for the Championship of the World, 1940 is World's Series, 1941 is World Series. It's worth distinguishing """"World Series"""" the series of matches from """"World Championship"""" the title at stake in the series.
The """"New York World"""" urban myth is widespread enough to be mentioned and debunked. 
 """"The title of this championship may seem odd to some readers"""" is not a justification for answering this question, since it relates to the previous question. The justification would be something like """"Some people have (jocularly or otherwise) questioned the appropriateness or accuracy of the name World Series""""  
I speculate that there should be some juicy examples of such questioning from U.S. journalists in the 1880s, or Latin Americans in the 1960s.  There is the quote attributed to John Cleese: """"When we [the UK] hold a World Championship for a particular sport, we invite teams from other countries to play, as well.""""  
There are various arguments pro and contra that might be made. But only those that have actually been made by noteworthy sources should be given. 
The relevant information seems to be present in the article.

Rand is not a philosopher
I don't think we ever resolved one big problem with the article: Rand is not a philosopher. The article continues to push the POV suggestion that she is indeed a philosopher, which is an opinion only supported by her and her followers. There is only one professor in all of academia that supports the idea that she is a philosopher, and thus the article is pushing an extreme minority view as the truth. We are essentially doing the complete opposite of what we are supposed to do with psuedoscience articles in an article about psuedophilosophy. The NPOV warning will remain on this article until we truly resolve this dispute.  LGagnon 

A few suggestions for what we should do with this article:
Change the infobox to Template:Infobox Writer
Remove all POV claims that she is a philosopher; replace them with something along the lines of """"Rand claimed to be a philosopher.""""
Do not refer to Objectivism as a philosophy; a term such as """"ideology"""" would be more neutral.
Remove categories that refer to her as a philosopher.  LGagnon 

Also, I'd like to point out this line from the article:
Rand viewed herself primarily as a novelist, not a philosopher  LGagnon 

Response to Suggestions

There are too many conceptual difficulties with LGagnon's suggestions. Again, we need good grounding, not unsourced opinion.

To begin. The distinction between philosophy proper and pseudo-philosophy requires a fleshing out of criteria. Don't conflate Anglo-American analytic philosophy with the ubiquitous  belief-system development that preceded it. Or you can scrub virtually all Continental systems (endless varieties of Existentialism(s))from the category (of philosophy).

In fact, the analytic of North America is merely a method for doing philosophy. It eschews systems as such, due to the influence of empiricist/positivist skepticism going all the way back to David Hume. (Recall Hume awakened Kant  at least so Kant relayed  from """"dogmatic slumber."""" Philosophy has not been the same since.)

Further, though we speak of belief-systems, since the decline of the Middle ages, and the notorious rote of the Trivium/Quadrivium, these systems have been increasingly secular and secularized in knowledge and value emphases. 

In that respect, Objectivism is no less than its equally original, equally American conceptual cousin: pragmatism. Indeed, LGagnon's very student-musings about the exact status of Objectivism in this regard remind one of the reception pragmatism suffered (and suffers still) by comparison to earlier Theocentric philosophic systems. William James famously claimed that the very first real lecture on philosophy that he ever attended was the one he himself taught.

Ergo, """"ideology"""" would not be a neutral mode of reference with regard to Objectivism anyway. That loads the controversial """"Objectivism-as-cult"""" smack into the supposedly neutral explication of the system. It utterly distorts the sourcing and external material that is required by Wikipedia. It loads original opinion/research of the most expansive sort. It fails to unpack the place of reason in the Randian corpus. 

Oh incidentally, many, very many philosophers in the analytic school disdain the Continentalists as philosophers. They used to refer to them, when favourably disposed, as philosophes  a la that great Continental Trio of the Enlightenment, Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu). Othertimes, analytics would dismiss your average Continentalist as a """"philosoher-manque.""""

Ayn Rand did not consider herself primarily a novelist. She explicitly addressed the issue of the novelist-philosopher distinction and with characteristic disdain: sneering at what she perceived to be the implication that one ruled the other out. She could not have been more univocal on the symbiotic connection she saw between the two. This is very serious indeed. AOluwatoyin""",0

 the period dealt with spans approximately mid-2013 to September 2014. This is an indication it may not meet criterion 3a. - As far as I can see, there is not a lot more to say about this young lady so far. While taking in interest in people who are famous because of their parents and because of who they date eludes me, it is no reason to fail criterion 3a.
 Daily Mail may not be a reliable source - There are a couple of references here that could be argued do not come from what is usually considered reliable. However, it is accepted in """"tabloid"""" topics to include """"tabloid"""" sources. Otherwise, Wikipedia would only consist of articles on people The Guardian writes about. Yawn!

However, these things should be adressed:
 Nowhere does it actually state that Wright and Penn are famous actors. That is however necessary, because otherwise one might easily ask why this person deserves a Wikipedia article in the first place.
 The archive links in the references are inconsistent. The style you should use is the one in reference #1 (Link to original page, publiser, archived from and then """"the original"""" as the link). This can easily be achieved by using the cite web template.
 However the first reference is not a good example alltogether, since it makes no sense that the page is from July 28, 2014 and it is stated that it was retrieved on July 19th. Please look into this.
 You might wanna find a better source for the Elvis and Nixon film. Maybe this one even though it is certainly not perfect as well.

The Hebrew name for Hebrew, """"Ivrit"""", is derived from """"Ivrim"""" (the Hebrew word for """"Israelites"""") meaning simply """"the language of the Israelites"""". Neither word means """"side"""". However, both of these words are constructed from the root consonants ע (/ʕ/,), ב (/v/) and ר (/r/).

I was acting on the advice of the admin who blocked you. The responses have a great deal of value, particularly as they're from experienced editors, rather than SPAs with fewer than 500 edits.  (talk) (contributions) 
I agree with Carl and other users that it is important for material to be properly sourced and to avoid original research and synthesis. I was concerned with the first sentence in the section Spin added:
For centuries the common story of the birth of Jesus has been a product of the two birth narratives in Matthew and Luke, but it is not easy to understand the progress of the individual birth narrative in each gospel, because the content of the other narrative is already too well ingrained in our approach to the material, so, in order to clarify the relationship between them, the basic elements are compared in the following table.'
The assertion that """"it is not easy to understand the progress of the individual birth narrative in each gospel"""" is a matter of opinion and needs an in-line citation refering to a reliable source. Same thing for the assertion """"because the content of the other narrative is already too well ingrained in our approach to the material"""". According to whom? Once again, it needs to refer to a reliable source.
It may be more productive to show the suggested section and table on this talk page or on a sub-page and then have editors comment and work through differences before adding the material into the article. At present there's no consensus to add the material, which means that Spin puts something in and then another editor like Carl removes it. In situations like this it's best to slow down, follow 1RR, and work through issues through talk page conversations. Alternatively, third opinions or other dispute resolution mechanism may help. Cheers,  
For the moment I have removed the introductory comment and left the original statement. (I'll just remind you of all the Christmas creches which depict the shepherds and the magi together, all the paintings which do the same, the comments here of people who cannot accept the scholarly opinion that Matthew has Joseph living in Bethlehem only to move to Nazareth at the end of the narrative.) 
I don't understand how a person will work through issues when they have successfully erased the material. One needs to be constructive to make progress on Wiki, not destructive. It is the dialog which allows progress. If a person doesn't want to enter into a constructive dialog, then it doesn't matter how one proceeds.

You don't give constructive indications as to how to improve the material. Constructive indications involve proposing alternatives that would make the material acceptable to you. As to primary sources, again, this is what Wiki says:
Primary sources that have been reliably published (for example, by a university press or mainstream newspaper) may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. Without a secondary source, a primary source may be used only to make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is verifiable by a reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge. For example, an article about a novel may cite passages from the novel to describe the plot, but any interpretation of those passages needs a secondary source.

I've only nominated a few, very obvious MMA people before.  Bostwick was deleted via AfD discussion.  A speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied.  To me, he still fails WP:MMANOT, but I'm in no way a MMA expert.  What do you think?   
At first glance it appears that Bostwick hasn't fought at the """"highest level"""" of MMA as required by WP:ATHLETE (or whatever the guideline is these days) and WP:MMANOT.  If I had an interest in having the article removed, I would AfD it again.    

Hello, It has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. Can I first point out that Jake Bostwick is a former UCMMA middleweight champion and currently the UCMMA welterweight champion? UCMMA is, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom. 

Secondly, after glancing over WP:MMANOT and WP:ATHLETE, I see that they are indeed guidelines. Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me, a guideline is optional when it comes to following it, meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article. 

Thirdly, I have spent much time working on the page (as well as being the creator of the page), I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun, The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a 'typical' mixed martial artist's Wikipedia page, as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars, and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability. The very sources on him alone helps him pass WP:GNG, which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion.

I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more, but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me, however I fairness to you we haven't exactly known each other for a while, so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the page's position on Wikipedia, now we can talk to help improve the page even more.

That, son, is a profoundly political claim. It is hostile, aggressive and completely about imposing a British nationalist identity upon me, my family and everybody I know.

While you were reading British Comics I was reading books like Edward Said's Orientalism (book) and Declan Kiberd's Inventing Ireland (book), both of which are books that emphasise the importance to colonial powers of controlling the representation of countries they have conquered. Claiming Ireland to be in this """"British Isles"""" is precisely about that, about controlling Irish identity, Irish direction. It is disingenuous in the extreme to claim this title is merely geographic: it is merely political! 86.42.90.145  """,0

"""=Not using """"Palestine"""" or """"Palestinian"""" for Talmud and rabbis to avoid confusion===

Note: Many articles about the rabbis of the Talmud and Mishnah are derived from the archaic Jewish Encyclopedia, published between 1901-1906, over one hundred years ago (when the Middle East was still under the thumb of the Ottoman Turks) and which used the archaic expressions """"Palestine"""" when referring to the Land of Israel, and to the Jews living in the areas of the historical Land of Israel as """"Palestinians."""" This is a big mistake that requires constant attention and correction, especially when copying and editing articles from the Jewish Encyclopedia or from similarly archaic sources such as Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897). At this time, no-one uses the term/s """"Palestinian/s"""" (in relation to anything associated with Jews or the land they lived in and which they regarded as their homeland) nor by any type of conventional Jewish scholarship, particularly at the present time when the label """"Palestinian"""" is almost entirely identified with the Palestinian Arabs who are mostly Muslims. Finally, kindly take note that the name Palestinian Talmud is also not used and it redirects to the conventional term Jerusalem Talmud used in Jewish scholarship. Thank you.

 Marvel Database Project 

Please stop
As others have noted on this page, Wikipedia disallows links to other wikis, such as the Marvel Database Project. Please see the guidelines at Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Examples, which state, among things, """"Wikis, including Wikipedia and other wikis sponsored by the Wikimedia Foundation are not regarded as reliable sources.""""   

Hello Tenebrae,
Thank you for leaving me a message about this Wikipedia policy.
In the same spirit as Wikipedia, I believe that the Marvel Database Project is indeed a reliable source. As an aside, I see dozens of links to Marvel.com's wiki, as well. Their wiki is far less complete, and on the whole I believe less accurate.
I request you reconsider the removal of those links as they contain valid and relevant additional information. At the least, I ask that we discuss this topic with other Wikipedia members, as I believe there would be support from other members of the Comics Wikiproject.
Would you consider further discussion?
Kind regards,
 

I completely agree.  If you'll notice, they aren't using the Wiki as a SOURCE; they're saying """"If you 're interested in more info than the Godawful 'notability' policy lets us post, go here.""""  Even on official policy pages they mention that you should throw up a link to an external fanwiki (look how many times Wookieepedia is mentioned in official thingies).  I'm going to readd the link on, because it's in my Watchlist, the Hobgoblin page, and I *will* take it to an admin if I have to.  
Right here:   Also note that Palpatine, a FEATURED ARTICLE, has a link to the Wookieepedia.  Final Fantasy VI, another featured article, has a link to the FF Wiki.  And so on.  If this practice was frowned upon, those would have been sliced out before they got FA status.  They didn't.   
Because it's not against effing policy to have them as LINKS.  And I don't care who originally put them there.  At any rate, I've raised the question here: Wikipedia_talk:Reliable_sources/Examples so let's see what they say.  
Apologies; I've gotten to the point where I don't consider that """"language,"""" especially as I was using it a substitute for a word I WOULD consider uncivil. ;) For what it's worth, use any language you like on mine. )  

Aquaman Dispute
Hello, Tenebrae. I was referred to you by fellow WikiProject Comics member  to see if you may be able to assist in a dispute over the Aquaman article. You see, I was under the impression that they wished me to create a separate page for the new incarnation of the character, Arthur Joseph Curry. When I created the page, other users illustrated to me that I had misunderstood them and reacted in a very hostile manner. I then stood behind my decision for the split when Maple Leaf brought to my attention that the Aquaman article itself was relatively large by normal article standards. A user then reverted the change and re-merged the articles, regardless of the glaring size issue.

I would appreciate your input and assistance in this manner. The main discussion is happening on the talk page for the Aquaman article, and your intervention as a respect",0

 Protest against the unfair treatment and edits by user 'blueboy96'  

I am asking blueboy96 to act fair and do take the very same action against this usera person who is publicly slandering me for many months now.

You can delete info and people as you obviously do constantly, but you can never erase the true happenings. The truth.

It is 'beyond unacceptable' what 'Delicious Carbuncle' is doing. Did you, blueboy96 not realize that I only copied her display and changed the linksto blogs and websites that give the accurate information?!

Important Statement for Blueboy96 from Mark Bellinghaus

regarding his recent action of blocking me, another Wikipedia editorplease do not erase this, it shows the edits of Delicious Carbuncle in which she gave herself awayshortly after I called Pauline Berry, Delicious Carbuncle would edit messages and name the members of MARILYN MONROE PRODUCTIONS, LLC, within her edits. Read

May I add that if 'Blueboy96' looks at '[Delicious Carbuncle]'s' site and realized what a wonderful statement you can find, including the linksthat this is screaming for the very same action. Fairness is one thing, fooling people like Delicious Carbuncle has been doing it, another. She is Pauline Berry and if you check those two IP addresses I provided, you can see that they are leading to New Zealand, Pauline Berry's country of origin and from where she has been slandering me, Internet stalked me for the past three years.

She is fooling the entire Wikipedia community, she has built up a page for her band member, added herself to it, but she has several times tried to delete other sites with the claims which she broke herself. That is what HYPOCRITES do. If you think that this is offensive, then please watch what Pauline Berry has done, what she is supporting. My mom is Jewish and she is crying on the phone because her friends told her about one of the slanderous defamations where Delicious Carbuncle aka Pauline Berry has her hands in.

You haters, you people are sick sick sick people. You defraud the world with your fakes and then you lie to everyone's faces.

I called Pauline Berry in order to make her stop her sadistic and crazy attacks and the William Travilla support. Who else would cut the truth off from the William Travilla site which was edited professionally until Delicious Carbuncle put her dirty hands on it, again.

Who else would edit things like 'Don't call me' and name my friends and my nameif not Pauline Berry. Delicious Carbuncle gave herself away and then realized what she did and erased it fast. Edited over it. So, I ask you 'Blueboy96' to also disaple 'Delicious Carbuncle' who is defaming me for the past five months here on Wikipedia. If you want to remain fair, you must take the same actionwhich you used against me. Or I will file for an investigation in this matter. Fairness should be practiced here on Wikipedia. What you have done is unfair and it is a bias move. I have copied the info that is on Delicious Carbuncle's site about me and just switched links to her sick website and blogshe is supporting people who wanted to break into my home, who threatened me with AIDS infected blood. Do you really think this is funny or something?

Here is my statement and I am asking for immediate action. Delicious Carbuncle is Pauline Berry. She can a million times claim that she is notbut we have caught her in too many lies in the past. She is actively supporting several frauds, she was attacking whenever we made another successful exposure.

This is a statement regarding your block. First of all, I am the one who has been Wikipedia stalked for over one year now by none other than Delicious Carbuncle, who gave messages through her edits. She followed every single edit and deleted EVERYTHING. She is Pauline Berry and I can provide her IP address if you do not believe me.

She has been too obvious for everyone. I am not accusing her, I have disproved her already with facts. She has absolutely and completely supported and defended the William Travilla exhibition fraud which we exposed to the public as being a 100% criminal fraud. She edited out the facts on the William Travilla page, added links to her friend's website, which is also a commercial website, Melinda Mason who sold copyright infringed DVD's on eBay.

Next stopthe VANITY FAIR hoax. Delicious Carbuncle started a Wikipedia page for Millington Conroy, after I exposed him for being a forger who fooled the magazine with his fakes.

I am being blocked for telling the truth? Delicious Carbuncle is defaming me on her page, you did not see this?

She claims that her interest is not focused on Marilyn Monroe and or memorabilia? Her edits are telling a different story. Next the Name of the Rose. She followed me twic",0

 Re: The Call of the Marching Bell 

I'm afraid that I've had to revert your edit.  Frst, your change from Bang-i-dara"""" """"Bang-e-Dara"""" wasn't properly explained.  The sources use a variety of transliterations; for example, the on-line translation uses """"BĀNG-E-DARĀ"""" on the title page and """"Bāng-i-Darā"""" in the text.  Is there good reason to choose one over the other?

Secondly, you seriously over-linked the article.  See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Overlinking and underlinking: what's the best ratio?:

""""An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:

""""Low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century""""

I've replaced some of the goods links that you added, and I've rewritten part of the article so that the problem of transliteration choice is dealt with.   (Talk) 

Hi, while I appreciate your concern for maintianing the quality of the article, I consider your reverts rather abrupt. Except for the linking of years, you do not clearly justify why you reverted other edits:
 E.g. wikilinks to rationality, pragmatism, materialism, spirituality, and patriotism). Although you later re-linked England and Europe and repaired """"articles""""!
 The reason for putting transliterations in Italics is to keep the reader aware of foreign language texts, which is a common practice
 In your edit summary, you blame me for unsourced changes. It is evident that I did not add any new texts for which I had to provide any """"source"""" but if you insist on keeping any part of text, you should provide the relevant citation 
In your edit, you have linked the word Muslim with Islam which are two different articles.
The use of i and e is problematic of transliterating Persian and Urdu texts respectively. But it is good practice to maintain the same standard in one article. The sound of """"e"""" is common pronunciation in Urdu. And as the book predominantly contains Urdu poetry, I followed the same pronunciation pattern.
Many thanks indeed for your messsage. My friendly advice would be to carefully see before any blatant reverts in future. cheers. Talk """,0

"Removed text 

I removed the following text from the article:

==Seating plans==
The predominant floor plans are comprised of vis-a-vis resp. face to face seats, seating rows resp. face to back with split orientation (half in each direction) for trains operated in both directions and a combination of those principles. In regional transport we can find seats aligned with the tracks to give more room to the standing passengers. In scenic trains seats are beeing orientied some degrees to the window are used. Some design variants have curved banks of seats to form a lounge. Flip flop seats that can be changed from face to face to face to back orientation are not used much due to its weights and consequences of the additional mechanism.

While this information could still be valuable, I don't think it's worded very well here.  Besides, the seating arrangements are different for each car type, and this text deals more with coaches than other types.  It seems to me that seating arrangements are better described on the car type pages themselves and not here.   20:48, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)",0

There is no mechanism here for ‘discretion’, ‘broad’ or otherwise, whereby they could obtain blanket license to violate those guidelines without accountability: the moment that such powers (to dispense with guidelines altogether) are vested in or arrogated by them, (1) they cease to be administrators and become ma-and-pa corner grocery’s owners, with the goods on the shelves their private property to dispose of as they see fit; and (2) Wikipedia ceases to be a community editing project and becomes the private fiefdom of a limited few.  So no, I do not believe you understand that you do not operate here in a vacuum of your own making: I am Wikipedia every bit as much as you are, thank you very much.

You allege that I ‘have misunderstood the essentials of the system’, without specifying wherein that misunderstanding might have consisted in.  You do not have the right to make such unsubstantiated allegations in this forum; those are hits below the belt.  You may say to me, ‘you have claimed xxx, which conflicts with stated policy xxx, and fails to take into consideration the fact that xxx, published here xxx’.  The right to make generalized unsubstantiated allegations amounts to the license to launch personal attacks, a practice that again runs afoul of Wikipedia policies.  You are now violating those policies yourself.  I am not concerned with your tone (whether ‘polite’ or ‘vehement’ and how that impacts my liking or disliking you), but with the substance of what you are saying and how that impacts the project we are both involved in.

I wish to state that your own demeanour here has always struck me as approximating something of a Big Brother from Orwell, a position in part claimed by a kind of doublespeak.  No one, not even the founder, holds here a monopoly on Truth (you might have called it ‘a system of permissions to hold opinions’): all views must be closely argued and fully substantiated, by everyone without exception.

Administrators found guilty of deliberately, with (malice or otherwise) aforethought, violating house rules, and subsequently showing remorseless, unreasonable, unreasoning, defiance to the challenges of such violations (on the strength that ‘I am an administrator and therefore I do not have to account for my actions to you’), must be removed as a matter of principle, and will be removed.  There is no other remedy, as failure to clean the house would amount to allowing it to sink to the lowest common denominator determined by such administrators (and their unaccounted and perhaps unaccountable private reasons which propel them to certain actions).  Enthusiasm for the project and other such factors cannot be sufficient qualification to make someone an administrator here: a certain integrity, a sense of ethics, and a modicum of objectivity (the ability, that is, to see beyond the tip of one’s nose), are also required.  While the fulfilment of these requirements cannot obviously be easily determined beforehand, the discharge of one’s mission as an administrator can be appraised retroactively, and such appraisal should determine whether a user should continue in his/her supervisory capacity.  You wish to protect the administrators accused of wrongdoing now (by failing to answer the facts of the case as requested, but drawing instead all kinds of red herrings out of the hat), from the desire to m",0

Tragedy vs. Massacre
Considering the fact that no third-party source refers to these events as a """"massacre"""" I think we need to move the title to Khojaly tragedy to avoid any POV here. Massacre is defined as: """"an indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people.""""

Even those who wish to ascribe full blame on the Armenian/Karabakh side cannot argue that this attack was a planned event. The tragedy took place during the Battle of Khojaly. 

Helsinki Watch notes: Helsinki Watch reported that """"the militia, still in uniform, and some still carrying their guns, were interspersed with the masses of civilians"""".

 your multiple editing practice 

Hi,

The following users have already mentioned this to you: , ,  and .
Your practice of multiple edits for simple changes is distracting to other user's editing of Wikipedia.
You have asked for explanations and have received them:
 It confuses users who are editing the page at the same time as you, as my confusion was when we edited Dayne Beams at the same time and you had only updated his game count and not the stats update time, and therefore I almost added an extra game to him.
 The number of edits a user has is almost meaningless. Nobody looks at this number, and a user's quality isn't judged by the number of edits, but rather by the quality of the edits.
 It floods the watchlist and the recent changes list and makes it harder to spot if other users have made inappropriate edits.
 (adding this one now) Micro-editing takes more time, which you could use for other things, such as bettering a larger number of articles.

We would all very much appreciate if you desist from this practice.

Thanks,

  

 I fully support all four comments. Cheers,   

 Following up from your answer on my talk page, Yes we would like you to do the whole stats change in one edit. In one edit change from """"Player with X goals in Y games as of round Z"""" to """"Player with X+1 goals in Y+1 games as of round Z+1"""".

"Hazel Eyes 

Hi, I noticed you had reverted my changes to the hazel eye section however left me a message informing me I could contact you on your talk page providing more information. I've numerously tried to get Wikipedia to change the hazel eye color section as it's informing people that hazel eyes can be gold/brown and green (either could be dominant) which is a myth as a hazelnut doesn't contain any significant green colouration whatsoever, it is true that sometimes very minimal green tints are present in a brown eye to produce a golden glow and create the hazel colour but hazel eyes can never be eyes that are significantly green with slight brown/gold admixture, that is a North American misconception which is believed to have occurred in the past 100 years or so, as in Europe the origin of light/coloured eyes and hazelnuts, the true/original meaning is still used. The problem is there is no documentation on hazel eye definitions changing throughout the years nor has there ever been a study conducted tracing back to how the myth/misconception in North America came about, it's more of an assumption that people have come to realize as North Americans have started inaccurately identifying eyes that are significantly green with slight brown admixture as well as eyes that are blue or grey with brown admixture; as the colour hazel because they're multi-coloured and appear to change in different lighting even though they don't resemble the colour of a hazelnut in any way. It's an issue/myth that requires common sense to understand really, so even though I cannot provide you with documentation or studies concerning the changes of hazel eye definitions becoming misconceived in North America I can provide you with numerous sources/pictures of what hazel eyes are supposed to be and what the colour 'hazel' is described as being;

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hazel (defines it as a light golden brown colour, after a hazelnut)

http://www.fanteye.com/extimages/p_FreshlooksColorblendsChartLG.jpg (shows a pure hazel eye, big difference to the green eye diagonally below to the right)

http://ygraph.com/chart/2990 (shows hazel as a honey/beige brown colour and categorizes is next to another brown eye rather than green)

http://www.colormecontacts.com/colored-contacts-for-dark-eyes (puts hazel eyes in the same category as honey, not green plus displays a green eye with abit of brown under the green category)

http://www.yestheyrefake.net/color_contacts_buy_photos.htm (shows hazel eyes in numerous pictures presenting them as a golden brown)

http://hazeleyes-wintergoddess.blogspot.com.au/2009/07/hazel-eyes.html (states the North American misconception and the true/original European definition while showing examples of various sources, numerous pictures and comments below of people agreeing and showing gratitude)

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_definition_of_Hazel_eyes (states the misconception and says that hazel eyes are supposed to match the hazel or cob nut, the fruit of the hazel bush/tree that grows in Europe)

http://m.rateitall.com/iPhone/item.aspx?p=0&ItemID;=1074601 (shows an optometrists opinion/experience with the issue while stating the North American hazel eye misconception and providing sources backing up his statement)

I would also like to state the very first reference to eyes ever being compared to the colour 'hazel' was by William Shakespeare in Romeo & Juliet in which he was comparing a persons eyes to the reddish brown colour of a ripe hazelnut; Mercutio: “Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes;–what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?” Act 3. Scene I Romeo and Juliet 
Source: http://blog.wordnik.com/shakespeare-soup

Considering William Shakespeare was an English writer it does prove the original intension/purpose of calling a persons eyes the colour hazel was to compare them to the colouration of either a light golden brown hazelnut or a reddish darker brown hazelnut and never a green and gold/brown mix or any multi-coloured eye (blue, grey or green with brown around the pupil) as a hazelnut doesn't present any blue, grey or green colouration nor is the colour 'hazel' described as possessing any of these colours. I only hope you're more understanding of this issue and can agree with what i'm saying, I strongly think you should keep my last changes to the hazel eye section so people can understand/know about what hazel eyes are supposed to be rather than leaving the information as it is feeding people with the North American myth. That being said the hazel eyes picture on the right of the hazel eye section isn't green or gold in any way it's actually a blue eye with significant brown around the pupil, the hazel eye section doesn't say anything about haz",0

Edits for Your Consideration

2)  NN has removed my client list as expected.

Candid Camera had its roots in Six Photographers, a groundbreaking exhibition held in Sydney in May 1955, which concentrated on what was still a relatively new development in Australian photography and featured the work of Max Dupain, David Potts, Axel Poignant, Gordon Andrews, Kerry Dundas and Hal Missingham.Robinson, Julie """"Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s"""" Art Gallery of South Australia exhibition catalogMcDonald, Patrick """"The Way We Were"""" The Advertiser, 20 May 2010 AdelaideNow websiteNewton, Gael """"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988"""" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055) The work of the first three of these artists is also represented in Candid Camera. Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael """"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988"""" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael """"Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950"""" Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher """"Decisive Moments"""", The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).

Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age – the fifties, sixties and seventies.

In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured “images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware”. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher """"Unguarded Moments"""", The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick """"Candid Camera"""" ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.

Photographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson,",0

Pfortuny on Pfortuny's mediation

Apologies for the delay and for the following text which is far too long and I think out of place, but the discussion has led us here. By no means I intend my opinion to be regarded as more important than any other's, but for obvious reasons some people are expecting it. Here it goes. The history of this text is in  15:09, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

After reviewing the history and talking to , I have got the following vision of the facts (which is the basis for my opinion expressed below):
Alex's editions on the 29 were done without discussion on the talk page. This was clearly a serious mistake which led to the first catastrophe, but I think we may assume good faith here, at least ingnorance, not malice, especially if one follows the summaries, diffs, etc... 
Alex's editions on the 9 and 10 November were done using the talk page but he made edits before discussing them and, given the complete history of the article, the edits were too bold to be accepted without previous discussion; this led to their being systematically reverted (which is common use in the WP for that behaviour) and in the end to the blocking of the page. This behaviour was clearly a mistake of Alex's, and I put it to his not having read the complete history. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of the problems were a result of confusion caused by his Asperger's Syndrome.
Nobody can agree """"not to make unilateral edits"""" (Adam's expression) in whatever page for whatever reason, this is a bit too generic and has no deadline.
He is aware of the damages he may incur in (damages for himself) if he repeats the above behaviour.
Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told me he was going to """"try to stay out of Mother Teresa's page for a while"""". He has privately told me he is not going to touch the criticism section al least for a fortnight.
It sounds nice to be a mediator, but on the other hand it is a responsibility I cannot (I mean cannot, not do not want to or do not like to) take up for the moment.
If Alex behaves like he did on the 9/10 November, I will also agree to any rational punishment. I want to stress that I was in disagreement with most of his edits.
I do not think that Alex will cause any further problems.

Before stating my opinion, I would like everybody to know that Viajero's suggestion on my mediation was done without either mine or Alex's prior consent. He later expressed his concern about this to me. I feel it is only fair to mention it here.

Hence, my opinion is:
Unblock the page. If Alex behaves in a non cooperative way, then the resources of Wikipedia to prevent this non cooperative behaviour will be used, as with any other user.

But I mean as with any other user. If he were going to appear in the problem page, he has to be told in his talk page in advance; if he were going to be banned, then he has to be told explicitly in his own page and by a sysop, or whatever the standard procedure is.  12:35, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I have read the above and agree with Pfortuny.   13:14, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Last sentence was inserted by Alex after reviewing the text in my subpage.  15:09, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

The newspaper cuttings can be found in date order at Press Cuttings, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton. There are no paqe numbers. In the Michael Aldrich article other references are also used. There are three central claims - he invented an online shopping system[he actually claims to have invented online shopping, which I left for peer review],Thomson Holidays 1981 was the first recorded B2B and Gateshead SIS/Tesco was the first B2C with the world's first recorded online shopper.

For the third, there is a peer reviewed source and a TV interview by Lawrence McGinty, an acclaimed UK science reporter, broadcast on Independent Television News in the UK in 1984.
In looking at the sources common-sense is needed. Aldrich's teleshopping systems received a very sceptical welcome. HiFi systems were the big news in 1980. Many reports of his new system are wonderfully garbled and a little silly. Few understood what he was talking about. Online shopping did not exist.

 Hello.  Thanks.  First, if you want to chat with me, please reply at my Talk Page - not at yours.  I check my Talk Page every day and see the new postings.  I certainly do not check your Talk Page every day to see if you posted anything there.  My Talk Page is at this link here > User talk:Joseph A. Spadaro.  Second, per Wikipedia rules, I am not giving any legal advice at all, just trying to answer a semantics question.  Third, remember that the situation and laws are different all over the place.  I am in the USA and answering as such ... I have no idea where you are located, and if it is within or outside the USA.  So, all of that being said ... I can now answer your latest follow-up questions.  Let me address the first part of your question, which states: """"one is free to terminate such a contract for whatever reasons are permitted or not forbidden within that contract.""""  In a one word answer, yes.  But, the way that your follow-up question is worded, it seems like you are mixing apples and oranges  that is, confusing very different things.  I guess I am not sure what you mean by """"terminating"""" a contract?  The contract itself usually has dates within it, such as """"This contract runs from January 1, 2008, and will expire on December 31, 2008.""""  So, you never """"terminate"""" that contract  it just """"dies"""" on December 31, 2008.  If you want to """"break"""" (""""stop"""") the contract before the ending date of December 31, that's a different story - and it would depend on why (what reasons) you want to not finish out the whole year-contract.  As you refer to, some contracts will have explicit terms within them that delineate when/where/how/why the contract may be terminated.  Some contracts have no dates in them, correct.  And, within them, there will be (there should be) certain reasons as to when / how / why either party may """"end"""" the contract.  But, in a one-word simplistic answer ... yes, one is free to terminate such a contract for whatever reasons are permitted or not forbidden within that contract.  Let me address the second part of your question, which states: """"one cannot legitimately accuse the contractee of 'insubordination' ...""""  Again, you are mixing apples and oranges.  So, it is a hard question to answer.  In a simple answer, the answer is ... maybe yes and maybe no.  If any terms of the contract deal with """"insubordination"""", then - yes, one party may certainly accuse the other party of insubordination.  For example, a contract may state: """"If Party A does not report to the work site prior to 9 AM, that will be considered insubordination"""" ... or """"If Party B does not submit the appropriate paper work at the end of the day, that action will be considered insubordination"""" ... or something like that.  So, if the terms of the contract deal with insubordination, then - yes, one party may certainly accuse the other of insubordination.  Now, let's say that the contract does not in any way mention insubordination.  (This is probably the likely case that you are referring to.)  Then, in terms of semantics (that is, language and wording) ... then, no  one party may not accuse the other of insubordination.  But, really, they can accuse the other party of breaching the terms of the contract ... that is, not meeting up with their end of the bargain in the contract.  So, the real and correct words (semantics) would be that one party accuses the other of either: breaching (breaking) the contract ... or ... not complying with the terms and consitions of the contract ... or words like that.  Those essentially mean the same thing as the concept of insubordination (not doing what you are supposed to do and expected to do, when asked to do so).  But, you just would not use the word insubordination.  You would use the word """"violating our contract"""".  But, in spirit, it all means the same thing.  So, if I was the party to the contract .... and the other party accused me of """"insubordination"""" ... and our contract terms never mention insubordination ... then, I would take that to mean that the other party is accusing me of not adhering to the terms of the contract and he is simply using the wrong jargon ... but he may (or may not) be wrong in principal and substance.  In other words, just because the other party used the wrong/incorrect word (he improperly used the incorrect word of insubordination), that doesn't change the fact that maybe, yes, I did do something wrong and I did go against the contract.  I hope this all helps.  Please reply at my Talk Page.  Maybe if you make your question a little more clearer and detailed, I can craft a better answer.  Thanks.  (  )""",0

An event in this article is a April 30 selected anniversary (may be in HTML comment)

 A question has been bugging me 
From the time the first US military advisors stepped in to Vietnam in the early 60s to the final withdrawal of all US troops in 1973 the USSR and China repeatedly warned Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon NOT to cross the DMZ and directly invade North Vietnam. That seems simple enough that we were not allowed to go in to the North BUT my question is were the South Vietnamese Forces allowed to go on the offensive and invade North Vietnam? Did USSR and China ever warn the South not to invade the North? 

Considering the U.S.'s coordination with and funding for ARVN, I'm sure that they would take South Vietnamese ground forces in North Vietnam much the same way they'd take Marines. The only """"crossing of the DMZ"""" that occurred was American bombing raids.  
Probably not, but it is doubtful that such an operation could have been pulled off.  23 July 2005
It's hard to imagine what further threats the major communist powers could have used to dissuade S.V. from doing anything. But I agree with CJK, the limited competence of the ARVN in offensive operations seems well-established in the historical record, e.g. the offensive in Laos.  (talk) 03:04, 2005 July 24 (UTC)
The forgotten factor in this little chat is the fact that the South and its dissident """"South"""" Vietnamese were often the target of U.S. bombing. Keep in mind that the terms """"North"""" and """"South"""" were circumstantial, and not actually representative of the demographic split. """"North and South"""" often simply repeats the ideological and geographic claims about the nature of the war, which American soldiers, for example, found to be not the reality: Many (perhaps most) people in the """"democratic"""" South were pro-independence, despite the Western-allied/ethnic Catholic elite. Hence any use of """"North and South"""" carries an inherent biased disparity with the facts. -|t 
I don't know what you are talking about. We were discussing whether or not the Soviets or Chinese would react if South Vietnam sent its forces to invade North Vietnam.  24 July 2005
""""I dont know what you are talking about."""" Well, it would really help if you did, wouldnt it? -|t 
Well maybe you shouldn't bring up unrelated issues in the middle of a specific discussion.  25 July 2005
I'd just like to commend the recent additions to the article.  
Actually, to my understanding, there were still many rescue raids (of captured POWs) or commando attacks that were conducted by either U.S. commandos or the """"Biet Dong Quan"""" (the ARVN equivalent) against the north during the war. It's an honour to meet celebrities like you, Trey and Parker Stone. I appreciate your criticisms to my editions on the Vietnam War page. - .
well others watching this page are quite capable of RVing Marxist language and POV it seems.  
And would RVing 'capitalist language and POV' be ok with you? -|t 
I don't know what """"capitalist language"""" means, but if it existed and was POV then I would have no problems with its reversion.  
We were actually talking about a full scale attack by South Vietnam, not a raid.  24 July 2005

Let's assume the South Vietnamese Army, without US troop support, did gather a formidable invasion force and did cross the DMZ in to the North, would the Chinese and/or USSR intervene and play the """"defending an ally card"""" for the North exactly like how we did for the South?  
I know this is a hypothetical assumption, but still, it's irrelevant, because the ARVN was never able to operate well without U.S. assistance. So answering your hypothetical, if that did happen active intervention in the form of Chinese or Soviet troops would probably not be necessary given the PAVN's superior capabilities. if we had somehow managed to make the ARVN into a capable offensive force and we were able to take over North Vietnam then yes, I'd expect the PLA (army in China) to intervene just like they had in North Korea. but American go",0

Because interracial rape is now overwhelmingly black on white, it has become difficult to do research on it or to find relevant statistics. The FBI keeps very detailed national records on crime, but the way it presents rape data obscures the racial element rather than clarifies it. Dr. William Wilbanks, a criminologist at Florida International University, had to sift carefully through the data to find that in 1988 there were 9,406 cases of black-on-white rape and fewer than ten cases of white-on-black rape.

I'll believe islam has nothing to do with terrorism when suicide bombers are no-longer video'd with a Koran in one hand and an assult-rifle in the other, but until then i'll just call it the religion of peace and everone else will laugh at that sick joke.

I lack the time to contribute many Wiki edits but I have been listening in on the current arbitration. I've noticed something that may be of interest.

You mentioned  here that one side Mosmac has been portrayed as """"a fragile consensus"""" and yet on the other recently start claiming the opposite.

One doesn't even need to look that far. 

Even in the current arbitration some editors are characterizing the use of """"FYROM"""" as evidence on disruptive Greek nationalists...
... yet on the other side they seem to be claiming that Mosmac wasn't a consensus to justify the move to plain """"Macedonia""""?

If I was participating I would certainly consider asking the users completing about """"FYROM"""" usage to clearly state whether Mosmac was ever a consensus or not. IMO anyone who says """"no"""" is essentially suggesting use of FYROM was valid if contentious. Anyone that says """"yes"""" is admitting it would be very inappropriate for an admin to use their special access to break a consensus.

ArbCom had a choice: to cast this as an issue of foundation principles (which they could reasonably have involved themselves with) or to cast it as a content issue and dismiss it.  they decided to do the latter for reasons of their own.  C'est la vie.

it's not a huge issue; this will quickly end up on ArbCom's plate anyway as a matter editor behavior, from some place or other - there's just too much tension around this particular problem, and too many people acting out on it like children.

Do you understand why File:Grand Kudu, Eritrea.jpg was deleted, Vetrisimino0?  I'd like to hear that you do; you should after a read of .  It seems the deletion was appropriate.  (And, it's reversible with permission logged via an [[Commons:OTRS| OTRS ticket].)
As for the suggestion to   From just reading this page, it looked like this had been settled, and the photos are to be left in and photos of members of other groups can be added over time (and there have been multiple other editors providing opinions already).  Good.  I would add that images should be shrunk or (better yet) merged, as at [:File:Eriamercol.jpg], so that this can happen.  However, I see File:Traditional_Eritrean_dance.jpg has replaced Tigrinya Eritrean wedding picture File:Eritrea_Eritrean_wedding.jpg.  Is this a problem?  I don't know the ethnicities of the photographed parties.  I haven't looked through the article's edit history and don't plan do.
Flickr has lots more appropriately licensed files.  I see File:Rashaida_family.png is on the french article, so there are photos available. 
Re. Faytinga photo: I think it should stay. Re.  The mayote site seems to be a mouthpiece for a particular set of politicial views, so I don't think it's a reliable source for much other than its own views. (My opinion would be swayed if it had a written fact-checking policy.)  However, given 3 other sources Vetrisimino0 says confirm Faytinga's mother's ethnicity, it seems reasonable to belive it's true.  Can you accept that, Middayexpress?  If not, I still think her picture merits inclusion (without noting her mother's ethnicity) and 'clutter' is a poor argument for its removal here.
I do wish to point out that a blanket order to a fellow editor like  is highly inappropriate and invalid here! The WP:BOLD guideline applies to, and allows, such edits.  However, so does the part of BOLD that guides one as to how to react when one's bold edits are not left in place.  So, in other words, both of you should read / review WP:BOLD. (I see no argument for an exception to BOLD.)

So, hopefully both sides will accept my opinions, and move on to edit on other topics within and without Eritrea.  There are points where I have agreed with each of you and points where I have disagreed with each of you (two each), and I believe I've been able to be fair and impartial.  Hope that helps.(t•c)",0

Countries like Georgia or Azerbaijan with serious seccession-problems in their own countries may have agreed,that South Sudan will become a member of the UN,but they may not recognize South Sudan as an independent country,which means,that they will not recognize South Sudan outside the UN and that they will not establish diplomatic relations.

I just discerned and have been enticed by the above argument.  However Gscshoyru, you should recognize his sourcing, and if that does not appease the requirments, then I shall look online until I find a citing that says Ronald Mcdonald is a happy clown (a secondary source of course).

Some people can easily circumvent ridiculous blocking like the kind you try to fruitlessly implement.

Wikipedia sued for ‘aiding neo-Nazis’
December 7, 2007 - 11:14AM

A left-wing German politician has filed charges against online encyclopaedia Wikipedia for promoting the use of banned Nazi symbols in Germany.

Katina Schubert, a deputy leader of the Left party, said she had filed the charge with Berlin police on the grounds that Wikipedia’s German language site contained too much Nazi symbolism, particularly an article on the Hitler Youth movement.

“The extent and frequency of the symbols on it goes beyond what is needed for documentation and political education, in my view,” she told Reuters. “This isn’t about restricting freedom of opinion, it’s about examining what the limits are.”

Schubert said she had taken legal advice before making her move, and that she hoped it would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist, anti-semitic and racist ideologies.

“There are signs neo-Nazis are trying to take advantage of such structures, and this needs to be stopped in good time,” Schubert said. “Especially given that Wikipedia is too important to jeopardise as an open and self-regulating project.”

A spokesman for Wikimedia Deutschland, an organisation that promotes the internet lexicon in Germany, rejected the charge.

“We don’t really know what Ms Schubert’s problem is,” Arne Klempert, managing director of Wikimedia Deutschland, told Reuters. “What’s important is the context the symbols are used in, and here it’s quite clearly education and documentation.”

“Anyone who tries to prevent the Nazi period being documented properly has a strange understanding of the world, in my view,” Klempert said. “Because that’s the best weapon there is (to prevent) something like that from happening again.”

Public display of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, but they can be used for educational and artistic purposes.

Schubert also came under fire from party colleagues.

“Katina Schubert fails to grasp the self-regulating mechanisms that work in Wikipedia,” Heiko Hilker, a Left party media expert in Saxony’s state parliament, said in a statement.

“Right-wing extremism on the World Wide Web cannot be tackled via national criminal proceedings,” he added.

Schubert said police would pass on the charge to state prosecutors, who would decide whether to open an investigation.

Klempert said Wikipedia’s structure, which enables internet users to discuss and edit content, ensured no bias arose. “Particularly on subjects like the Hitler Youth, you can be sure it would be changed in seconds if it did (show bias),” he said.

The Hitler Youth was the Nazis’ official youth organisation.

 Do you know the superracist """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" in Turkey? Do you know that some Wikipedia Users are doing valdalism by showing themselves as the advocates of the Five Pillars of Wikipedia ? 

Sinanoglu is not only a chemist, the """"moreover"""" and """"the"""" more important, he is the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""". The person who is subject of that article (Oktay Sinanoglu) published autobiographical book in 2001 in Turkey by using the fake titles of the “World’s Youngest Professor”, “Lord of U.S.A”, “at the peak point of science in U.S.A”, “The Turkish Einsten” etc. so he gained a lot of prestige in Turkey and a few million Turkish student accepted him as their idol and having been believed the fake titles of Sinanoglu are exactly true they occured the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement”. The last ten year (2001 – 2011) Sinanoglu became the “Hero of People” by using these fake titles that he published them in his bestseller autobiographical book. Today, by contributing a few million college student, the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” was like the superracist “Hitler Youth Movement” in Turkey and Sinanoglu became the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""" everywhere. By reading the autobiographical book of Sinanoglu, large amount of college students became “superracist Turks” under the influence of Sinanoglu’s megalomanic and fake titles. So, they are conducting the election campaign: “Sinanoglu must be the President of The Republic of Turkey!” Eight years ago, the first edition of this article was written by some members of “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” as the summary of Sinanoglu’s autobiographical book and this Wikipedia article was used by them in Turkey as the proof that the titles of Sinanoglu had been accepted as exactly true by whole world, so every Turk must believe that this titles of Sinanoglu was exactly true. That was the begining and the developing of the """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" in Turkey. Did you understand now why I was interested and why I am working to edit this article by using verifiable documents over 200 references? Please look at the edit history of the article. You will see a lot of vandal attacks to clean my editings. The last vandal attacks came from “Salvador21”-“Khazar2”-“Bobrayner” If you look at these users pages, you will see that these users are Turks and they are related with “Ottoman Empire” articles in wikipedia and they advocated “New-Ottomanist Imperialist Ideology” that Sinanoglu propagated this ideology in his autobiographic book. As a result, the some members of the superracist """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" cleaned the all words of the article which is writen by me and they provided to put blockage to my editings by showing themselves advocates of the Wikipedia Five Pillars. The “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” are in joy that Wikipedia blocked my editings. And now, they sing a song: “Long Live the Five Pillars of Wikipedia!

An event in this article is a March 28 selected anniversary (may be in HTML comment)

From Wikipedia:Village pump:

How many images are too many? I've only ever seen one image. I wanted to add the famous picture of the soldier shot in the head to the Spanish Civil War page, as well as a typical propaganda poster of the times.
 0000 EDT 23 May 2002

IMO, a couple more legal images would be fine.  The article only has 1 image after all.   04:17 23 May 2003 (UTC)

I've recently brought over a lot of new content from the Spanish-language wikipedia. I've done my best to integrate it, but someone may want to take an editorial pass. Also, it seems to me that we ought to have several """"sidebar"""" articles dealing with things like the internal situations in Madrid and Barcelona during the war and there should probably be a lot on Spanish anarchism and the various plitical parties of the time that either exists and should be linked to, or doesn't and should be written.   09:02, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Could someone please explain the communism vs civilization comment in the intro? Thanks. - , 2004-03-14t09:29z
 An atttribution would certainly be nice, and I didn't put it there, but it's certainly on the mark as to how some viewed it. I've seen Hearst Movietone newsreels from the period, and that is pretty much the picture they present. It's also the rhetoric to be found in Franco's speeches during the war. It had very little basis in reality, in my opinion, but leaned heavily on communist atheism and anitclericalism, and the destruction of churches (and  in some cases  torture, murder, etc. of clergy and members of monastic orders) that occurred in the opening weeks of the war. I think the article is accurate in saying that the atrocities in those opening weeks were roughly equal, but the fact that many on the Republican side targeted the Church was endlessly exploited in the Nationalists' rhetoric, and struck a note with conservatives elsewhere who otherwise might have kept more distance from fascism.   17:55, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Pro-Nationalist link
I for one am inclined to keep, for the moment, the recently added Professor Marek Jan Chodakiewicz on The Spanish Civil War. There ought to be at least one external link to a site more sympathetic to the Nationalists than to the Republic. However, I don't think it is a particularly good site: there must be a far more comprehensive presentation of this case (maybe even with some decent footnotes and/or external references itself?) elsewhere on the web. If someone could find a better one and substitute it, I think that would be an improvement.   

 Not Neutral 
I added the note """"The neutrality of this article is disputed."""" because of the insistence in that General Franco or his forces were fascist. This is just communist propaganda. We know better now. Communists wanted to overthrow the legal system of liberties in Spain to create a system similar to that of the Soviet Union. General Franco and his coup prevented that. Of course, the Republican legality was not restored, but that was because it had not proven safe from revolutionary risks. And Monarchy was not restored probably because King Alfonso XIII fled the country only because his partisans lost a municipal ballot, so it appeared to the victors in the war that that king was not reliable to grant individual rights. Of course, Franco's Dictatorship is more than objectionable, but it does not prove that it was a fascist regime.

(this was unsigned, but it's User:Makjavelo

 Frankly, I think this one characterization does not make a non-neutral article. I disagree with much of what Makjavelo has just written, but I do agree with him that the article (or maybe an associated article) might gain from a more extensive explanation of the somewhat complicated relationship of Franco's politics (and Falangism in general) to fascism as such.   17:44, Jun 8, 2004 (UTC)

 This seems like petty apology for Franco, in my opinion. Not only the communists, but the anarchists, socialists and most Republicans refered to the Francoist forces as """"fascist;"""" as well as many historians and authors, e.g. Hemingway. I forget the exact quote, but a Christian clergyman (who were notoriously right-wing at the time, in popular belief) stated that Franco's regime was totalitarian, because he """"controls all aspects of one's life,"""" which can be argued because of the high degree",0

 How about...( Warning: I'm Irish)

 Edits proposed to plot description 

""""“Joliet” Jake Blues is released from the Joliet Correctional Center after serving three years of a prison sentence after being convicted of armed robbery.""""

Entry for Joliet Correctional Center.

""""Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own.""""

It's unclear here, however the Caddy Jake refers to may be Murph and the Magictones' pink vehicle first seen in the """"Howard Johnson's"""" scene where Jake and Elwood phone Maury Sline and are blasted the flame-throwing mystery woman. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment).

Part of the film's humour is the actual name of the orphanage. Credit to Kathleen Freeman. People erroneously thing charities and churches are completely tax-exempt; however the exemption most notably only extends to Federal income taxes. The property tax bill would probably have remained an unforeclosed lien had the church not decided to sell voluntarily to the Board of Education.

""""At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Show Band and Revue.""""

Credit to Cab Calloway and James Brown.
  
""""As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall.""""

Entry for Bluesmobile; since location in Chicago and Illinois is obviously a major plot element, reference that the particular law-enforcement agency here is the ISP; SCMODS article already exists, with explanation of the meaning, in this context; article exists for Dixie Square Mall. 

""""After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher).""""

Credit cast member Carrie Fisher; this scene is cut from many televised versions, DVD featurette commentary explains that Canadian actor Aykroyd felt this scene explained the Bluesmobile's magical abilities, yet director Landis felt this was not transparent.

""""The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room. The mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.""""

Candy's character was important because he assisted in locating Elwood's abode; the 'Wrigley Field bit' is important plot-element humor.

""""Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with",0

I think some more narrative prose is a good idea. The main tables should still be there for easy lookup, but the topic is complex, often controversial, and different sources have different numbers. And all this could/should be elaborated on and explained in the article, yes. Many people will come to the page with numbers on their """"own"""" country that they have learned or read, and we should have some text explaining more thorowly what the numbers we list include. And that's probably best done outside tables and in addition to just simple footnotes.

Maybe we could also have separate casuality sections for the different (major) countries, with text and tables where there could be made room for lower and upper bounds on numbers and space for citing different sources and their numbers. Not so much that I expect you to find and look up every different estimate, but there are many people editing and there could be a value in having room for those comming here later with different sources to add to the information. I don't know.

But I really like your work so far. It was about time that we got some well-sourced numbers in this article. Well done!  """,0

Sorry, I was referring mainly to the INTRO not the rest of the article. 

The intro does not mention at all any of: 
 the """"repressive measures"""" (only equivocally """"human rights situation"""" which anyone can interpret according to his/her hearts wishes;) 

 terrorizing of ethnic groups also is absent.  
 
the term  """"repressive security appartus"""" again does not reflect Saddam's barbarism towards ethnic rivals - ('security appartus' usually means secret police, Stasi type state surveillance etc)

 """"lacked consent of iraqi society"""" also doesn't appear there in any form; 

If you put all those things in the INTRO and i'll be happier.  Most people only read the intro, either because they are too lazy or too unwilling to scrutinize their prejudiced views; and an equivocal intro panders exactly to those types of readers, encouraging them. The intro should be built in such a way that fairly represents
the two main popular opposing views of Saddam: as a brutal dictator, regional threat of WMD and terrorism, vs. freedom fighter / modern Sallah a-Din whatever his supporters want to call it.  It does the latter but not the former. Yes, you cannot avoid the possible reader conclusion that Saddam's popular support may not be despite his brutality but because of it; This is one of the legitimate paradoxes sorrounding this figure (and that of most dictators).""",0

Those 'warnings' Yopie distributes here and there, are manifestly unwarranted, and rather a signal of twisted tactics in Wikipedia conduct than anything constructive. For example, Yopie sometimes alleges vandalism in clear cases of non-vandalism. Yopie's such behavior should and may lead to him getting sanctioned.

The reason the PS2 lacks AA is because AA requires processing power. If the PS2 were to attempt to render any of it's higher-end games with added AA, it's framerate would keel over and die. I further believe you have no idea what you are talking about because you claim AA does not make digitally rendered images look better. The following chart is borrowed from the AA's wikipedia page.
(a)(b)(c)Figure 1

(a) is no AA, (b) is with AA, and (c) is with a different AA. If you honestly believe (b) or (c) are in some way """"blurry"""", then I agree you are entitled to your own opinion. If you do not find (b) and (c) to be blurry at all, but less Jagged, then you realize the importance of this effect. You would then realize that AA does not cause your video quality to be blurry, but it is more likely that your TV is causing the blurryness. I know this because TVs are already too blurry for my personal preference. The PS2 does not actually need AA. It is not ment for use with an HD TV. However, if you were to use a PS2 with an HD TV, you would realize the presence of massive jaggies in comparison to the xbox's picture quality. Just incase you did not know, you compare screenshots by seeing how they would look on the highest quality screen, prefferedly the same screen unit. You do not compare them by putting them on an old tv from the 1980s. A 1980s TV would make the PS2's graphics look far more competitive with the xbox's graphics. However, an HD TV would not. I have not  made any false statements as far as I know. I assume that was directed at the AA bust. The reason I said the PS2 lacked AA is not because it could not do it, but because it does not do it. That last statement is sort of like saying a low end Dell computer is more powerful than a super computer because it has sold 100x as many units. This is not about grabbing ilrelevent facts such as sales to divert the fact that you're wrong and can't prove otherwise, this is about how the xbox is more powerful than the PS2 and the screenshots are clear evidence. """"I never said PS2 is more powerful."""" is what you said. """"Xbox is not more powerful then PS2"""" is the arguement. The architectures being different does not make it unfair to compare them. You can easily compare them with performance tests. The xbox excels farther at it's target goal than the PS2, therefor it is more powerful. Is there an arguement to that? Does the PS2's 6.2 GFLOPS (relative to the xbox's 2.9 GFLOPS) suddenly make the PS2 more powerful? Does a meaningless benchmark magicly make the PS2 better at doing something that the xbox is actually better at doing? No it does not. The xbox consistantly exhibits better performance, therefor it is nothing but logical to say it is more powerful.""",0

110th CONGRESS 1st Session S. RES. 300

Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) should stop the utilization of materials that violate provisions of the United Nations-brokered Interim Agreement between FYROM and Greece regarding `hostile activities or propaganda' and should work with the United Nations and Greece to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals of finding a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.

IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

August 3, 2007

RESOLUTION

Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) should stop the utilization of materials that violate provisions of the United Nations-brokered Interim Agreement between FYROM and Greece regarding `hostile activities or propaganda' and should work with the United Nations and Greece to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals of finding a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.

Whereas, on April 8, 1993, the United Nations General Assembly admitted as a member the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), under the name the `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia';

Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 817 (1993) states that the dispute over the name must be resolved to maintain peaceful relations between Greece and FYROM;

Whereas, on September 13, 1995, Greece and FYROM signed a United Nations-brokered Interim Accord that, among other things, commits them to not `support claims to any part of the territory of the other party or claims for a change of their existing frontiers';

Whereas a pre-eminent goal of the United Nations Interim Accord was to stop FYROM from utilizing, since its admittance to the United Nations in 1993, what the Accord calls `propaganda', including in school textbooks;

Whereas a television report in recent years showed students in a state-run school in FYROM still being taught that parts of Greece, including Greek Macedonia, are rightfully part of FYROM;

Whereas some textbooks, including the Military Academy textbook published in 2004 by the Military Academy `General Mihailo Apostolski' in the FYROM capital city, contain maps showing that a `Greater Macedonia' extends many miles south into Greece to Mount Olympus and miles east to Mount Pirin in Bulgaria;

Whereas, in direct contradiction of the spirit of the United Nations Interim Accord's section `A', entitled `Friendly Relations and Confidence Building Measures', which attempts to eliminate challenges regarding `historic and cultural patrimony', the Government of FYROM recently renamed the capital city's international airport `Alexander the Great Airport';

Whereas the aforementioned acts constitute a breach of FYROM's international obligations deriving from the spirit of the United Nations Interim Accord, which provide that FYROM should abstain from any form of `propaganda' against Greece's historical or cultural heritage;

Whereas such acts are not compatible with Article 10 of the United Nations Interim Accord, which calls for `improving understanding and good neighbourly relations', as well as with European standards and values endorsed by European Union member-states; and

Whereas this information, like that exposed in the media report and elsewhere, being used contrary to the United Nations Interim Accord instills hostility and a rationale for irredentism in portions of the population of FYROM toward Greece and the history of Greece: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the Senate

(1) urges the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to observe its obligations under Article 7 of the 1995 United Nations-brokered Interim Accord, which directs the parties to `promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by state-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility' and review the contents of textbooks, maps, and teaching aids to ensure that such tools are stating accurate information; and

(2) urges FYROM to work with Greece within the framework of the United Nations process to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals by reaching a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.",0

""""Do you have any sources to suggest what these Buddhist actually call themselves? They call themselves Dalits for all I know"""".
I have the vociferous complaints of the editors on this very talk page who self-identify as Buddhist, for one.  Please read the entire talk page, I'll be happy to provide as many diffs as you like if you choose not to. For more sources, there are several websites devoted to this.

I quite agree with you, if the internet is any indication. I've found 45 different Buddhist groups of varying strength in a directory aimed at listing Buddhist groups throughout the world (on a side note, I plan to contact as many of these groups as I can, for a seperate matter). That was just a cursory bit of research, and not aimed at that particular assertion.  I'm sure more energtic research will reveal more.

"Which is which and what is what? 

To someone who is not familiar with grammar terminology, the main (first) section does not make it clear which of the examples are objective and which are subjective. Also, some indication as to what 'target' and 'initiator' are would be helpful. To describe things by associating them with other grammatical terminology alone, just leads people in a circle of strange new words and explains very little to those who might actually need to seek help in understanding grammatical terms by referring to a free online encyclopedia. It would be nice if someone could make this clearer and more accessible to the uninitiated. Thanks.",0

Aha! So Kayla and Kailina are the same; but there's more to be explained. After checking some more sources I think we can be sure of the existence of at least two separate Agaw dialects/languages (just like Bender 1976:8 says; but unlike Ethnologue and Sommer 1992): first, Qemant-Kemant-Chemant-Kamant-Kimantinya-Kimanteney, and secondly Kayla-Kaila-Kailinya (ethnonym Betə Israel (cf. Mann & Dalby 1987:16), xenonyms Falasha/Felasha from Ge'ez 'immigrant, stranger'; Yihudi (cf. Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992). Kemant could be extinct by now (Sommer 1992 mentions that """"according to Gamst, Kemant is threatened by extinction""""). In any case, a huge language shift is going on here; all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue, only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left, out of an ethnic group of about 170,000 people in 1998. Endangered, to say the least.
Quirin (1998) leads me to believe that an important reason for Qemant and Kayla being separate languages is that their speakers (coming from a common Agaw base) developed separate identities from the beginning of the 14th century on. However, apparently there's a lot of fuss going on in Beta Israel historiography (cf. e.g. ) and I don't know enough about it at present to judge sources like this (though Qurin seems to have done his homework).
Anyway, a third dialect seems to be Qwera/Quara/Qwarina/'Kara of Kwarasa'/Hwara/Hwarasa; this one appears to be extinct (cf. Ethnologue). It seems to have been related more closely to Qemant — Gamst (p.c. to Sommer, Sommer 1992:358) proposes that """"Quara, Quarinya, spoken by a few Falasha in Quara (to the west of Qemant-land), is nearly the same language as Qemant.""""

EDIT: The statement can be removed just on the basis that it adds no value to the article by making it even more biased towards enabling the Holocaust all over wikipedia. It assumes that - Leuchter doesn't know the amounts of cyanide needed to kill, and it assumes that Leuchter tried to disprove the gas chambers through ignoring the facts. Both of these without any proof that that's actually the case. 

Also, even if that was the case - what does """"tended to confirm it"""" mean? Even safe amounts of gas found by any interested parties would """"tend to confirm"""" that gassings took place, so it's irrelevant.

"Disruptive edits 

Hello, . Despite 's statement, you have not so far been reported at WP:Administrator intervention against vandalism as far as I can see; but if you continue your disruptive editing you will be. Looking at your edits, I get that you have strong opinions about John de Ruiter. While I know nothing of him, I have some sympathy with your position. But you are going about your campaign in a way that is disruptive to Wikipedia, and you need to stop.
First, as you have already been told, you introduced material (and, in particular, critical material) into a biography of a living person without giving any references to a published source which supports your material. This is absolutely forbidden, but the first time you did it our policy of assuming good faith should lead any other editor to just remove your additions and explain to you that this is not acceptable; and this is what happened.
What you are encouraged to do at that point, is to discuss the matter on the talk page Talk:John de Ruiter, and try to reach agreement with other editors; if you are unable to do so, our dispute resolution procedure would tell you how to proceed.
What you did do, is to insert your unsupported material again. This is called edit warring, and is a quick way to get yourself blocked from Wikipedia.

Assuming that you are in good faith (i.e. that you think the de Ruiter article is unbalanced), your best bet is to start by finding some reliable published sources which are critical of him (not blogs or forums, but material from reputable publishers). If you can find some, then you may edit the article to add only what is supported by the sources you have found (though in view of your recent history, even in this case you should probably start by discussing it on the talk page). If you cannot find such sources, then I'm afraid you must not edit the page further. Unsupported material and original research are not permitted in Wikipedia articles.

I suspect that you believe that it is important to expose something you think is not right about how de Ruiter presents himself. If that is that case, I'm afraid that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and you may not use it in that way.",0

", as I promised here is a brief discussion of the different types of distillation used in the hydrocarbon processing industries that I am very familiar with ... i.e.,  oil refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants (extracting natural gas liquids known as NGL's), and other hydrocarbon processing industries. Those industries probably have perhaps 80% or more of the industrial distillation columns in existence.

Other industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, the alcohol distilling industry and the fine chemicals industry also use quite a bit of distillation, but I am not familiar with those industries.

Major Industrial Distillation Types: The two primary types of industrial distillations are Continuous Fractionation or (Continuous Distillation) and Batch Distillation. The industrial Continuous Fractionation distillation towers are typified by the large, vertical, cylindrical columns as can be seen in the oil refinery photograph in the Fractional distillation article. Please note  that by continuous, I mean 24 hours a day for 1 to 3 years before being temporarily shut down for maintenance ... and we are talking about towers with diameters ranging from about 65 centimeters to 6 meters and heights ranging from about 6 meters to 60 meters or more.

There are many subsets of the Continuous Fractionation primary distillation type, such as: 

 Fractional distillation
 Vacuum distillation
 Azeotropic distillation 
 Extractive distillation
 Steam distillation

The above subsets would be of approximately the same size range is the primary Continuous Fractionation towers. The vacuum towers require reinforcement (provided by a number of steel beams encircling the tower exteriors) so that they can withstand the difference in pressure between the exterior atmospheric pressure and the interior vacuum. 

As for the vapor-liquid contacting trays or plates used in industrial distillation towers, it is virtually impossible to explain bubble-cap or valve trays (or sheet steel structural packing) without drawings or photographs.  We need someone who could make such drawings. We also need someone who can make a drawing of a typical kettle-type reboiler commonly used as the heat input to a  distillation tower (although there are other types of reboilers such as fired furnaces, horizontal or vertical heat exchangers, bayonet heat exchangers, etc.).

Finally, if you look at the the simple sketch that I made of a typical fractionation tower overhead system in the Fractional distillation article, that sketch needs to be made longer so that it shows the feedstream  entry (at about the center height of the tower), and the bottoms exiting the tower and entering the kettle reboiler .... with the final liquid bottoms product leaving the kettle reboiler and the reboiled vapor returning from the kettle to the tower. -",0

 Origin 
Parts of this article particularly the """"Origin Section"""" not only failed to cite reliable sources, it also left out material facts as regards to the true origin of Takrur (also spelt Tekrur).  In this regard, it totally left out the history of the Serer people (also spelt """"Serere"""", """"Seereer"""", """"Sérère"""" and """"Sereer"""") who are not only the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia along with the Jola people (Source: Gambian Studies No. 17. People of The Gambia. I. The Wolof. By David P. Gamble & Linda K. Salmon with Alhaji Hassan Njie. San Francisco 1985.)  to which Takrur is part of, but the article gives the impression that Takrur was founded by the Fula people and/or only the Fula when both historical and archaeological sources contradicts that claim.  In fact, at the date and time of raising this article for discussion, no attempt was made by certain people to acknowledge the trutful history of the Serer people who resided at Takrur or Tekrur. Edits I had previously made were vandanlised by a certain person with false and ridiculous accusations. As such, I call all interested parties for an open discussion before I start making further edit on this article.  That aside, there is no mention of the Serer people in this article.  It is a fact that members of the Serer group have resided in Takrur for milleniums, ruled it, implanted their own royal dynasty as well as their ancient religion (The Serer Religion or """"Fat Rog"""").  

The following is a quote from Henry Gravrand, author of """"La Civilisation Sereer Pangool"""" who also authored """"La Civilisation Sereer Cossan"""":

""""Since the publication of """"Cossan"""" (history), I took as a starting point of the Sereer story in Tekrur over 2000 years ago, I noted an important discovery. In the middle of the Sahara, in the Tasili the rock carvings listed by Henri L'hote, appears the traces of the present """"Sereer Cossan"""" (Serer history) or their ancestors, a period dating back to the third or fourth millennium. This engraving represents the Sereer initiation Star (Serer Cosmology),  with two coiled snakes, symbols of the """"Pangool"""" (ancestral spirits also ancient Serer Saints in the Serer Religion)... The rock where the Star appears is the Sereer symbols of the Pangool which was probably a place of worship.""""  (Source: Henry Gravrand. La Civilisation Sereer - Pangool.  Published by Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal. 1990. Page 9. ISBN: 2-7236-1055-1.)

The history of the Serer people who resided at Tekrur, the influence of their culture, history, religion and tradition on the land should not and cannot be erased from history.  To quote Issa Laye Thiaw, author of """"La Femme Seereer"""":

""""If the term """"“religiosity"""" expresses the commitment or devotion to a particular religion, it also applies to the Serer who are jealously attached to their traditional values and show little interest in respect of religions from outside.
However, few people adhere to these religions and gradually move away from the religion of the land.   The latter is the object of aggression and distortion on the part of some Muslims, to weaken the impact in people's minds. In this context, their Serer neighbours assigned names and adjectives to things they have invented from scratch, trying to prove their superiority and that of their religion (the Serer Religion)…. The Serers are so far, one of the few people of Senegal who are not yet fully converted to a modern foreign religion…. Obstinately attached to the religion of their ancestors, the Serers refused to change the social and religious life inherited from their ancestors, making every effort to prevent the penetration of foreign religions in their country.  Only recently were they superficially converted to Islam and Christianity.""""  
(Source: Issa Laye Thiaw. """"La Religiosite de Seereer, Avant et pendant leur Islamisation"""". Ethiopiques no: 54, Revue semestrielle de Culture Négro-Africaine. Nouvelle série, volume 7, 2e Semestre 1991.)

Issa Laye Thiaw's remarks about Islam is absolutely relevant as far as this article is concerned.

"""

I have several points regarding the recent discussion.  1) I believe that BruceHallman's statement that the phrase """"generally assocatied with the United State's princples and interests"""" conforms to WP:V, WP:NPOV AND WP:NOR is incorrect.  First, I believe that the Heritage foundation source he uses, as pointed out by David Oberst, is not being interperted correctly.  Simply because countries that are rated """"free"""" by Freedom House are generally more supportive of United States interests does not mean that Freedom House's rating are generally associated with United State's intersts.  After all, the long-time US ally Saudi Arabia is treated very harshly by Freedom House.  The summary of the Heritage foundation report does not accurately reflect the assertions in the report which in fact states the opposite, """"As nations become freer, both politically and economically, the policies that they consider to be in their interests become more closely aligned with policies championed by the U.S.not because they are U.S. policies, but because they are policies consistent with the interests of free societies.""""  This means that the verification for that statement is not valid.  In addition, even if it were quoted accurately, the Heritage Foundations stated goal is to """"formulate and promote conservative public policies;"""" they are not a neutral source.  (Indeed, most of the sources for this artical are not neutral sources but are sources with strong bias one way or the other.)  Citing other's opinions, while they are verifiable, does not make them neutral.  
2) BruceHallman is correct, however, in questioning Ultramarine's suggestion that the test of if something is valid is if it reflects how Freedom House describes itself.  Freedom House itself is not a neutral source, and while they may be a good source for some parts of the article (such as when they were founded or who the chairman of their board is) descriptions of their ideology, goals, etc. should probably be cited as """"Freedom House's states"""" etc.  Simply because Freedom House doesn't describe itself a certian way doesn't necessarly mean that it isn't valid.
3) Saying that Freedom House is """"generally associated with US interests"""" isn't necessarly a critisim; however, it is not a statement of fact, either.  Merely the fact that it has been debated so much on this talk page indicates that it is not a verifiable fact, but rather a matter of some contention.  I will outline how I think the article could be better constructed to include the differing opinions of Freedom House in the next bullet point, but I think that the introduction should probably be saved for things that are clearly true, and not things that are up for debate.
4) I feel that if the article is restructured slightly and the primary editors of this article (which, lately, seem to be BruceHallman and Ultramarine, who clearly have different views of Freedom House as an organization) could agree on this structure, it would save a lot of debate.  I think the introduction of the article should state basic, verifiable facts (What they are, where they are headquartered, where they are located, and the fact that they are best known for publishing books).  A statement saying that their political agenda is a matter of contention might also be included to indicate not everyone things that they are all sunshine and roses.  I think the next section should be """"History and Organization"""" and outline when and by whom they were founded, it's organization structure, the fact that the board is mostly American, it's funding, and it's membership in other organization.  I think that the bit about what their activities (both in the historical section and in the organization section with the quote) should be moved to the next section, """"Activities.""""  The Activities (though that is maybe a bad heading) would include the above statements of what Freedom House's claims of prior activities are, the fact that they publish book and details of those books, and the information contained in the """"other activities"""" section.  The final section, I think should be titled something along the lines of """"Political Leanings, Agenda, and Controversy"""" or something, and would be a space for the differing views of Freedom House to be discussed.  The validity (or lack their of) of their ratings, if they are bias in favor of an Ameri-centric point of view, and if they are neo-cons or not could be discussed here.  If the proceding sections are well written, they will be limited to things that can be easily verified, and all the debate about if Freedom House is good or bad will be contained in this section.     Calling this section """"Criticisms"""" has implications that I don't think are necessarly correct.

Did it ever occur to you that what you are doing is imaginary...there was no concept of a """"Grand Slam"""" when Wimbledon started in 1877, or when the US Open started in 1881, or when the Australian Open started in 1905. It was not until the 1930s that the idea of the """"Grand Slam"""" emerged. What you are doing is an ahistorical revision of the past. Ok, many persons do that...it's called """"hindsight."""" Some have an issue with counting """"slams"""" before the challenge round was abolished; others have a problem with pre-open era counts because they excluded professionals. As there is no consensus and Wikipedia calls for pluralism...the article reflecting multiple major points of view...it would not be too much to come up with a solution that would list """"most slams, Open era"""" and """"most slams, pre-Open era."""" So why is it too difficult for you to accept the idea of, at the very least, listing the pre-1925 French """"Open"""" winners? All your excuses are cop-outs (too much work? others don't agree with you, so you want to mess up the board?). Maybe if you stepped back and asked why were others adding the """"greyed-out"""" cases to the slam counts, you might find your answer.

When I open the Encyclopedia Britannica (a BRITISH reference), they list all the winners of the French """"Open"""" back to 1891. When I open the World Almanac (an AMERICAN reference), they list Suzanne Lenglen as having won 11 titles. So, what makes you more authoritative than THOSE sources?

Thank you, Dave, and thank you for your welcome on “My Talk”.

“This section was started with discussion of """"bias in favor of Darwin's theory"""" raising the issue of misrepresentation of Darwin by anti-evolutionists, and as discussed above, we have to give due weight to the overwhelming scientific majority view on the basic subject of evolution.”

I certainly agree with that. 

But on the issue of using “realised”, I just have a couple of things to say. But as a preamble, if you like, I want to make the distinction between a theory and the reality that scientists etc test it against (I’m not being insulting, I assume everyone knows this already, but I’m making a case). Scientists don’t “prove” theories are true. But by conducting experiments they falsify the “bad” theories (again I assume you know this and obviously this is in agreement with the philosophy of Karl Popper).

Now,  I think it’s bad practice to state things in such a way that a theory sounds like it’s the “truth” (meaning in perfect agreement with reality) because it destroys this distinction (between theory, or scientific fact, and reality or truth. To say that “X realised that Y”, where Y is a theory, is suggesting that Y is “in perfect agreement with reality”. Now, I think the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” does correspond perfectly with reality, but I also think we need to remember that it is still a theory (nothing is proven, remember, according to Popper) consistent with the general scientific method and perspective I already briefly outlined. Of course, in the case of evolution, someone arguing like this sounds rather silly  - it sounds like you’re being pedantic bordering on obsessive. Of course not all theories are the same - Popper would argue that theories that have “survived” criticism and rigorous testing are more “corroborated” (but never fully verified). But even if you wanted to make some exceptions, like the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors”, for the sake of scientific consistency, I think we should refrain from using “realised” in this context (incidentally, in regards to making exceptions, I certainly wouldn’t make any exceptions in respect to the sources given by David Wilson - these seem to me to be much more egregious cases of the word “realised”).

Anyway, so much for theory. As far as concrete help is concerned, have you thought about deleting “who realised that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” altogether?  You probably know more about the history of evolution than I do, but I thought that this idea didn’t actually come from Darwin (I could be wrong, of course). But if it does, what about “Charles Robert Darwin FRS (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist who first proposed the fact that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and also the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection” or some variation on this?

I’m sorry that you’re upset over the removal of the material you added, but part of editing on Wikipedia means that your edits may be mercilessly edited, and if the material you add is found to be in violation of policy, then editors required to remove it. They are not under any obligation to ask your permission to do so, and in general, the Wikipedia community is not going to rearrange the way they do things in order to suit the demands of a newcomer. Rather, it is your obligation to learn the ropes here.  Responding to my rather polite post above, in which I complimented your work, and provided links to the relevant policies in question, with the message you left on my talk page, which was rather rude in tone, and ended with an all-caps remark (which is considered the equivalent of yelling on the Net), is a violation of the Wikipedia's Civility Policy, and is not the best way to show the community that you’re willing to be a part of it.

For now, I’ll put aside your message to me, and try to explain a bit further the policies in question. 

Yes, Wikipedia’s Verifiability Policy does require that we source the material we add to articles, so that readers can verify the material. They cannot do this if we do not inform them of where the material comes from.

The sources in question have to be reliable. That means they must be considered credentialed experts in the area in question. For comics, examples would be sources such as Wizard magazine, Comics Buyer’s Guide, The Comics Journal, Newsarama, Comic Book Resources, books by analysts like Danny Fingeroth, and interviews on DVDs of movies adapted from comics, as well as any mainstream press stories you can find.

Websites whose content is user-generated, such as personal blogs, forums, message boards, fan sites, other wikis, The Internet Movie Database, The Comic Book Database, etc., are not reliable, because anyone can create a blog or submit material to those sites, which do not exercise editorial control over that material. Exceptions to this would be the personal websites of people would be considered reliable sources in the field in question, such as Mark Evanier, John Byrne, Peter David, etc. (See WP:USERG, which is part of WP:Identifying Reliable Sources.)

Similarly unacceptable is material derived from the editor’s own personal opinions, observations or analyses, which is called Original Research. Adding an analytical comment to an article about a film is fine if it's from a review you cite by Roger Ebert. Adding such a comment when the observation comes from the editor who adds it is not. Some editors point to the primary material in which the narrative is found, but the primary sources (such as an issue of Amazing Spider-Man) only contains the narrative itself; it does not contain any analysis of it. Material is not quoted or paraphrased directly from a source, but which constitutes an analysis or observation derived from it is called synthesis, which is a form of original research. The bottom line the need to ask, Who is the person making the observation? If it's the editor, it's simply not permitted.

The website you cited in your revert is not a reliable or verifiable source, not only because it is a fan site, but because it doesn’t even mention any of the material you added. It simply lists issues of the books. You can’t just point to books and say, “It's all in Amazing Spider-Man”. The original stories might be, but comments like """"The key difference between Brock's heroism and Peter Parker's mainly being..."""" are not.

As for the remaining issues:
As far as the issue of integration is concerned, the analysis by Mike Conroy does not deal with the issue of characterization, so I added it to the Lead, where such summary-type analyses can go. The material on Paul Jenkins’ run belongs in the Publication section, alo",0

To get you unblocked, Wikipedia:Blocking policy#If you disagree with a block requires discussing the matter with  the blocking admin, so if we can show that any problems with uploaded images have been resolved that gives us a good basis to go on. There's no problem with photographs you've taken yourself provided that you make them available under a suitable licence, and they're not just pictures of something copyrighted such as a modern painting: see Wikipedia:Image use policy. A lot of the images seem to be album covers which should be ok for fair use illustration of an article reviewing the album, some are of paintings as at Image:Falkirk1.jpg where the licence tag shows it as """"released into the public domain by the copyright holder"""" – as with the castle photographs, this means getting permission confirmed and forwarded to the Wikimedia PR department at the e-mail address """"permissions AT wikimedia DOT org"""", so it would be great if you could forward any emails that you've still not sent on: see Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission for the full procedure. Note that this isn't necessary if the artist who produced the image died more than 70 years ago, when all that's needed is naming the artist and using the Template:PD-art-life-70 tag – Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Public domain gives more info.

Having worked in radio for 18+ years in the Harrisonburg, Virginia area, and having worked for WACL (98 Rock) for 5 years (ending in 2005), I have respectfully asked that the format information for this station be changed to reflect it's official format, which is Classic Rock. The station's official format is Classic Rock, not Rock, Album Oriented Rock and not Active Rock. I received this response from users who will not allow me to edit the content myself:

    """"I talked with that other user and he said since WACL """"makes no clear distinction in its marketing (and based on the station website and group website, it doesn't) either rely on the Arbitron listing (which is derived from the station's own reporting)"""" it should fall under the Rock label. Not AOR, or Classic Rock, just plain old Rock. I will make a note in the article that the station plays a 50/50 """"blend"""" of Classic Rock and Active Rock. - NeutralHomer • Talk • """"

In my opinion, the accuracy of the content depends on fact, not on how the station markets itself, and not on Wikipedia users' opinions of what the station sounds like. The station does, in fact, rely on Arbitron when creating sales pitches to their advertisers, and Arbitron lists the station as Classic Rock because the station has reported to Arbitron that it's official format is Classic Rock. Having an extensive amount of professional experience in radio in Harrisonburg, Virginia qualifies me as an expert on this particular subject. Again I ask that the following changes be made to the content on the WACL article:

    WACL (98.5 FM, """"98 Rock"""") is a Classic Rock formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Elkton, Virginia, USA, serving the Harrisonburg/Staunton, Virginia, area. WACL is owned and operated by Clear Channel Communications.

    History

    The station first launched on February 22, 1989, with the callsign WPKZ. During that time, the station would carry a country music format, branded as """"Z-98"""".

    On March 7, 1997, the format was changed to classic rock, branded as """"Cool 98.5"""". To accommodate this, the callsign was changed to WACL. On May 2, 2001 at midnight, WACL changed their branding to """"98 Rock"""". On April 1, 2008, WACL began carrying the syndicated radio program Nights with Alice Cooper, when it moved from WBHB-FM at 105.1 FM (now WTGD) to WACL-FM at 98.5 FM when the format had been switched to classic country.

    Music

    WACL plays a blend of Classic Rock and Active Rock.

The current content is completely inaccurate and non-verifiable. Because I am an expert, I am considered a verifiable source according to Wikipedia.

 About """"Two Chinas"""" 

I re-wrote and expanded the """"History"""" section for several reasons.
 One, I think """"Background"""" is more appropriate since the article is about the term """"Two Chinas"""". There is no actual thing as """"Two Chinas"""". So a section that deals with the background of the situation described by the term is better called """"Background"""" and not """"History"""" - """"History"""" should be used for a section on the history of the term.
 Two, there was a lot of misleading content in the article, such as the stuff about the Ruijin Soviet: I've seen that claim (that the Ruijin Soviet was the first time there were """"two Chinas"""") bandied about in online forums and anti-Communist China magazines from time to time, but it is factually untrue, since China was split between many autonomous entities throughout the Republican period, and the Ruijin Soviet was no different from any of them.
 In re-writing the Background section I was hoping to illustrate that history of division and separation in order to place the final division that led eventually to the current situation in a historical context.

I don't want to get back into the debate. My latest run-in with the Indian flag-wavers (thanks for noticing, btw) has made me very disillusioned, and I will trust your good judgment to trim, edit, or restore whatever parts of the text as you see fit. Cheers,  (Talk) """,0

 I engaged in no personal attack. What I did what point out that Headbomb's edits were illiterate and incoherent (and incompetent in the sense of being unobservant of literacy and coherency). Headbomb himself admitted as much by correcting merely some of the illiteracies and incoherencies which I pointed out to him (while leaving most of the problems he introduced intact), of which corrections are totally unneeded if Headbomb would stop repeatedly introducing them. Headbomb's edits are purely destructive. He has added no information to the article; he has simply deleted information, and that while introducing illiteracies and incoherencies.

 He also has issued bizarrely false statements about his edits, such as stating that """"Tipler is not known for either the 'purported physical proof of God' nor any recognized quantum theory of gravity/TOE."""" Yet that's what the only two sections in the """"Academic work"""" section state that Prof. Tipler is known for claiming.

 Along with the deletion of the links to free book chapters (of which edits had previously been reverted by the Wikipedia administrator Irishguy), the pattern of Headbomb's edits show a clear intent to damage the article due to Headbomb's ideological dislike of Prof. Tipler and his work, of which is further reinforced by the personal information on Headbomb's user page. That is, Headbomb is attempting to get rid of information that would be helpful for others to learn more about Tipler and his work (such as the links to free book chapters; and the infobox """"Known for"""" field which, in the useful form in which I had it, would quickly let people know what Tipler is known for claiming: whereas listing books names and the Omega Point Theory's name would only make sense to someone if they already knew of them, and so they are either purely redundant or unhelpful; etc).

 Whereas I have an actual history of adding value to this article by writing most of the article's text, adding sections, and adding most of the references. I don't point out this fact as a claim of ownership over the articleunlike Headbomb, who has effectively argued to the effect that the supposed """"hard work"""" of his illiterate and destructive edits entitles him to keep the article the way he edited itbut rather to point out that I am actually literate and competent, and that I actually care about making it easier for people to learn about the subject of the article; unlike Headbomb's illiterate and incoherent edits, which get rid of highly useful information in order to make it harder for people to learn about the article's subject.

 The article was doing fine until Headbomb came along. He has acted purely as a troublemaker in regard to this article, due to his ideological dislike of the article's subject.

However, as far as the specific point over whether it relates to the article: harmony cannot exist without intervals. When two distinct (by which I mean different) pitches are sounded, the interval between them is what creates harmony. Harmony and interval relationships are inseparable, because they're one and the same. So absolutely, a section explaining intervals is relevant. However, the way in which I went about explaining it in my contrib wasn't so great. Again, I would encourage a competent and learned musician to do a re-write, or wait and I'll do it.  

 I will say one other thing, which is that Wikipedia is a learning reference, and will serve its best use to the public if Average Joe can come along and glean complete information from non-confusing articles. My ideal is this: say a churchgoing person, one who has very limited musical knowledge, wants to learn how to sing the alto/tenor/bass/whatever line in hymns, so that he/she can feel more """"one with God"""" on Sunday mornings. I want for that person to be able to look at this article, and come away with a clear idea of how harmonies work, so that he/she can practice singing them. The oneand onlything which creates the alto, tenor, and bass lines are the fact that they're pitched at an interval to the melody (soprano) line. Again, intervals and harmonies are one and the same. For the large percentage of the population who struggles with learning things """"by ear"""", a comfortably firm understanding of interval relationships is (along with practice thereafter) the magic key to unlocking the ability to """"hear"""" (discern) harmonies. That's why I think it's important to keep the section in question, but to rewrite it.  """,0

 Trivia lesson  

Ok, I’m going to enjoy this… Here we go, amateur. You can reply where I indicated between paregraph so that the disscusion can be more organized:

1. Rupert Thorne was a recurring villain in a Kingpin fashion from the 2nd half of the 70's until the Crisis came. Then he was forgotten and then saved by Timm in the 90's for the animated series. Falcone is just a recurring name Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb use when he needs to mention Gotham City mafia. Carmine, was never a lead villain like Rupert has been. If you accuse me of just watching the animated series (which I deny) I can acuse you of just getting exited because of the Carmine appearance in the last movie. Maroni is just a support guy for Two-Face's story, as Tony Zucco is for Robin's (who is the nerd defending minor characters and bragging about how he knows nick names everybody knows, like """"Boss"""" and """"roman"""" , now? heh, heh, heh)

2. every single comment can be sourced. Appealing to whom, for example is the easiest comment to source if you want to waste your time like that. Just check how many batman titles are published every single month and how many people buys against any other superhero's books. You will learn that monthly, the amount of baman books sold is good enough to call the mythos appealing. That's why there are 6 motion pictures, 2 animated series (without jl and superfriends and even scooby-doo appearances by joker, riddler, scarecrow and penguin) and, live action show and several internet about batman, his foes and his mythos. That's why the mythos is so appealing.

3. Catwoman is dangerous. Following your logic maybe mr zsasz would be batman's worst enemy. Being a killer doesn’t make an enemy notable as his protagonism and his importance in the mind of Batman and Batman readers, writers and creators does. Knowing Batman's identity and not being completely on the good side makes her even more important. You seem new to the comics’ world, do you really think Catwoman is going to be Holly for so long? Context, PC, context. Selina has been a main character for more than 60 years, I’m talking about all those years. Not about the comic book you just bought on the corner store last week, my """"mate"""". Following again your line of thought, it not worth saying Nixon was a president because he is dead. We couldn’t say Adam West was Batman because that show is of. And you called my ways childish…

4. I think you might be confused. We are talking about Batman. You might be thinking of some other superhero. In batman comics bets are that, if you buy a batman comic from any year at random, or watch any episode form any batman series, also at random, The Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, the Riddler or Two-face are going to be the main villain. If you get the croc, or scar-face, the mad-hatter you are loki, and if you catch you hero the """"Roman"""" you are really, really a lottery winner. By the way there it’s something called figurative speech, and it means to compare situations, I dunno if they told you. They are not literary on a race.

5. Hugo, the Scarecrow and the Hatter are influential because, whenever they appear, the story goes on a deeper lever exploring Batman's mind and messing with it. Those characters are useful tools when a writer wants to analyze Batman. Besides, I don't know if you are capable of using your imagination, I’m sure you can, it’s an indispensable tool for getting into the story when you read, but if someone messes with your mind on the level they have messed with Batman’s , that'll probably leave some ugly emotional scars on you... good thing he is the Batman. Therefore, they do get to be influential in a way. Thinking they don't get to appear as much as the five previous, therefore they are not influential is just wrong

 A request... 

Just completed the latest lesson for the VC.  Would you proofread/edit it please?

BTW, I've looked over your contributions again.  Your participation in deletion debates is good.

The main objection in your RfA was """"Lack of policy experience"""".  The basic reasoning is, that it is impossible for avid editors to read pages without editing them, so if you've read the policies and guidelines, that would show up in your contributions.  On guidelines you can generally make minor changes directly to the guidelines themselves.  With policies, unless it is fixing grammar or typos, you pretty much need to post the edits you want to make to the talk page for approval - but that becomes habit after you get used to it.  So my advice is that you start proofreading the P&G;'s, and see where that takes you.  I see David Fuchs has prepared a nomination for you.  Before you accept another nom, you should probably get in around 1000 meaningful edits to policy and guidelines pages and their respective talk pages, and about 500 edits in dispute resolution RFCs, s, some mediation, etc.  Then ask '''''""",0

 Race and Intelligence: Asian-Americans 

I've noticed you've contributed much to the race/intelligence articles and thought these articles might interest you:

http://paa2009.princeton.edu/papers/90354

""""Using data from recent Current Population Surveys (CPS), this study compares third-and-higher 
generation with earlier generation Asian Americans and non-Hispanic whites in terms of 
socioeconomic characteristics and demographics. The findings suggest a “third-generation 
decline or flattening” for Asian American and white men as well as Asian American and white 
women. For each of these groups, the mean of years of schooling among the 2.5 and third 
generations is lower than among the first and second generations. This pattern is most 
pronounced among Asian Americans. As for wage determination, the generational differentials 
can be explained by educational attainment and other basic demographic variables. Overall, these 
results suggest that assimilation beyond the first generation immigrants no longer improves 
socioeconomic attainments as expected by traditional assimilation theory. Furthermore, in the 
case of Asian Americans, cultural assimilation across the generations may actually lower 
educational attainment and thereby reduce wages contrary to traditional assimilation theory.""""

""""It is widely noted that Asian immigrant parents have higher educational and socioeconomic 
expectations and motivations for their children than do non-Hispanic white parents (e.g., Goyette 
and Xie 1999; Kao 1995, 2004). Asian families also tend to invest more aggressively in 
financial, human, and within-family social capital than families from other racial groups (e.g., 
Sun 1998). Yet, protective effects of ethnic cultures and resources decline according to more 
acculturation into the mainstream U.S. society (e.g., Kao and Tienda 1995). As third-or-higher 
generation Asians become more “Americanized,” they tend to embrace the prevailing U.S. norm 
that as long as good efforts have been made based on one’s ability, the outcome would be 
acceptable even though one has not achieved the best performance or reached a higher level of 
education (Chen and Stevenson 1989; Stevenson 1988).""""

Likewise...

http://www.ibtimes.com/asian-americans-increasingly-defying-stem-stereotype-246578

""""Shinagawa pointed out another interesting phenomenon; later generation (second, third, fourth, etc.) Asian Americans on average have markedly lower education and income compared to immigrant Asians.

In 2007, 33 percent of PhDs conferred in the U.S. were to Asians. However, of that 33 percent, only 2 percent were Asians Americans born or raised in the U.S.""""

These trends are reflected in their TIMSS/PIRLS scores, which are often used by people like Charles Murray and Richard Lynn as proxies for IQ.

http://i39.tinypic.com/zob4p0.png

Note that native born Asian-Americans perform worse than native born Whites in every subject.

My goal here is not to put down Asian-Americans, but I've noticed that lots of modern racialists like to use Asians as a battering ram against other minorities.

It was 89.57. You rounded up. I love how have to type sentence after sentence about a subject you clearly know nothing about. It was a 27.3 m (89.5 ft) female caught off the South Shetland Islands in January 1925. Whether it was measured or not I can't say. It wasn't measured by a scientist in the standard zoological manner (in a straight line from the tip of the rostrum to the notch of the flukes) though, so it probably wasn't measured accurately (if at all). It was most likely measured alongside a factory ship during flensing (unless it was taken to the Deception Island station). This was just before the widespread use of stern slipways, so it would have been difficult to measure if it indeed was.

 Tyrannosaurus FA 

Hi Sandy, I was wondering if you would have a quick look at the Tyrannosaurus article and see if it looks to you to meet current FA standards?  I am wondering whether to initiate a discussion on it with a view towards it needing an FA review as the text to me seems repetitive, handling of units hap-hazard and inconsistent, significant overlinking, and needing some reorganisation.  I would welcome any thoughts you may have, and to be clear I am not asking that you take on the job, I just seek the view of an experienced FA contributor.  Thanks.    
 Hi, EdChem ... I'm sorry I have been of so little use in responding to your requests for help lately !  I've been quite busy in real life, so haven't had the time for the sustained commitment needed to review at the FA level, although I can occasionally dip in to DYK for a quick source review.  (Will respond to Tony's DYK issue as soon as I can I'm more concerned about sourcing, padding, and copyvio issues than how interesting hooks are at DYK I think interesting hooks might be a concern if the basic pillars of Wikipedia were being met, and I'm concerned that DYK is still a place where not even basic pillars that apply to all articles are upheld.)   When I was new to Wikipedia, dinosaur articles were all the rage; as often happens, it seems that many of the editors who maintained those articles have moved on.  At a quick glance, I can see numerous problems (as you outlined, including uncited text) with the article, but those problems aren't as bad as many older FAs that typically appear at WP:FAR.  It's not surprising that a high-profile topic like tyrannosaurus would deteriorate after its principle editors move on. Instructions at FAR ask that editors post to the talk page before initiating a review, in hopes that some interested editor will improve the article and remove the need for FAR.  You cannot go wrong by listing some of the obvious issues on talk to see if anyone will surface to work on the article.  If no one surfaces in say a month, I agree that the article probably needs to go to FAR.  But there are so many FAs in so much worse shape ... I digress )  Best,  (Talk)

 Differentiating the deposement from the coup

""""Although this call (referring the Resolution of August 22, 1973) for """"redirecting government activity toward the path of Law and ensuring the constitutional order of our Nation and the essential underpinnings of democratic coexistence"""" was invoked to justify the September 11 coup, in retrospect that was clearly not the agenda of the coup.""""
The oxymoric phrasing """"in retrospect... was clearly not"""" is at best POV, and at worst, merely a redundancy (since """"in retrospect"""", ie. after the fact, Pinochet clearly (did) not return power to the Chilean legislature after the legislature implored the military removal of Allende.

The net effect is that you deleted a bunch of content, plus which there is more to say about each individual rate (construction particulars for instance), plus it doesn't work with the categorization system.

In the case of the RN rates, all have much to say about them - rationale, evolution, employment, plus a picture or two so we can see what they looked like. This article should be about the system as a whole (who introduced it and why? When did it go out of use? How did it compare to other nations' systems?) - once you have adequate treatment of all that, plus the two screenfuls with two representative pictures per rate, that's a pretty hefty article, no longer easy for reader to get the basic definition of """"third-rate"""". When considering organization like this, it's worthwhile to look at history of all the articles concerned, and maybe query the editors who set it up, because what you've effectively done is to destroy article structure that I and others carefully set up some time ago.

No I am not missing the point; I am disagreeing with you. Since he still uses a regnal name, the """"other clergy"""" argument doesn't fly. He was a pope and is pope emeritus, so his article's title should remain as close to the established convention as possible. The fact that he stepped down is not a compelling reason to drastically deviate. Nothing in what you say makes any logical argument for why """"Benedict XVI"""" is the best form for a pope emeritus.

"""WJ didn't perform at the WMA because he can't sing at all anymore. That is the real reason he hasn't toured for a decade, along with his bankruptcy. Even his vocals on """"We've Had Enough"""" four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with, certainly not comparable with the real King, Elvis Presley. Jackson has had financial problems since at least 1998 due to his declining sales and popularity, as well as his inactivity and having to support an entire family - not just those three children who aren't his biologically. In 2002 it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and after losing those lawsuits in May 2003 he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of $400 million. Invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album, """"Dangerous"""", and it was all crap. 99% of Jackson's few remaining fans regard it as his worst album. In 1989 Jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the King of Pop - meaningless, self-proclaimed title. He even planned to buy Graceland so he could demolish it, which certainly says far more about Jackson's megalomania than it does about Presley. Half the songs on the Dangerous album were crap, especially the unbelievably awful Heal the World, and it only sold 30 million copies on the strength of his previous three albums. Blood on the Dance Floor sold an incredibly low 6 million and it was rubbish. Yeah, WJ was unique all right, as many unfortunates found out. You must know some very sad 20-year-olds if they still admire that disgusting pervert. Anyway, most people know him as Wacko Jacko. Justin is the real King of Pop and like Eminem he just doesn't want to risk offending WJ's mentally ill fans. Justin will continue to perform, while Jackson's career finished a decade ago. ( )

"""************************ HENRIETTA VAN LAER says, No,. it's not that having an agenda at all is a problem for Wikipedia. Wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda [pro-socialists, liberals, greens and gays, determined to vilify and demonize conservatives]. It is a completely biassed source. Its articles on so-called left-wing parties are blatant whitewash while those on so-called right-wing parties are nothing but vilification, most of it based on flimsy third-hand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact. Instead of detailing their policies, Wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice. The frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing, particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship.
POV in Wiki-speak = different POV to us, the Wiki-police.
 I also get the impression that Wikipeople are pretty young. There is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views.
Under """"conservative"""" we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich. How naive can you get? I don't know what the term """"fat cat"""" means in the USA but here in Britain it has a very specific meaning i.e. the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of 10-15 times the average. Naturally they are inclined to vote Labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party. Then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a right-wing tax-cutting party. Many of them earn two or three times the average wage, and like the fat  cats, they get generous pension-packages too. Added to the votes of the millions of people who live long-term on state benefits, this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honest-Joe workers or low-paid. But Wikipedia is still living in a world of student politics, with a poster of Che Guevara on the wall, his hair streaming in the wind.""",0
"""::: Monkeykiss, Stephen I agree with you. I will ad the socio-political implications in the main section. In my opinion, the deeds (kamma)and its effect of an individual, being completely irreversible, are stored in the collective memories of others. They pass on to others and future generations through social and biological mechanisms ( books, heridity, stories, fables etc). For e.g. Hindus and Muslims are still warring because of bad deeds of Muslims committed 1000 years ago. Thus there is no need for any etheral means for transfer of kamma from one generation to another. the rebirth concept is not necessary for the transfer of kamma. Anyways atleast one thing is certain that the same person never takes re-birth again. Kamma may recoil on the doer ( if i kill, i may get killed through revenge) or it may have an impact on others ( if i take a bribe, my children will have to suffer social stigma) or it can have effect on the future generations ( if i harm the environment mindlessly, future generations will not get clean water/air). It is not necessary that in all cases the deed kamma bounces back to the doer. Still the Law of Kamma is sufficient for maintaining the moral order as the key learning is that all actions will leave an impact which is irreversible. Thus its imperative to """"THINK"""" before acting. There is no gain in regretting/praying later. Your opinion pls? with metta

In fact, rather than wait, here's my complaint:

To whom it may concern, 
 
Hi.  My name's Jim Heller and I'm currently and for some time now caught up in a series of edit wars with Jossi Fresco.  The background is this.  I am a former follower of Prem Rawat, a/k/a Maharaji, a person I believe is a nefarious cult leader.  Fresco, on the other hand, is a current follower and, needless to say, of a different mind altogether.
 
For some years now, ever since the advent of the internet, Rawat and his followers have engaged in a long-standing campaign to whitewash Rawat's past and somehow protect him from the harsh light of history.  The latest flashpoint arose just today when I tried to edit a Wikipedia article of another of Rawat's current followers, a religious studies professor in fact, Ron Geaves (who, by the way, just shot to flashpan infamy as the English academic who opined that the July 7th bombers were """"demonstrators"""", not """"terrorists"""".  
 
Please excuse the fact that, to explain the problem in any meaningful way, I have to flesh out the context somewhat.  My edit concerned an academic (not Wikipedia) article Geaves had written where, discussing a program Rawat held in 1973, he wrote that:
In November 1973, Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome, a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90,000.  The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S.  with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors.  Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations.  He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.

(My emphasis here and below)

In fact, a widely-disseminated invitation to that same 1973 program, Maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the """"millenial expectations"""" but fanned the flames substantially.  Thus, he declared the program the """"most Holy and significant event in human history"""" and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significance:

A LETTER FROM GURU MAHARAJ JI 

Bonn, Germany 

September 31, 1973 

Dear premies, 

First of all, I would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us. Because we have realized this beautiful Knowledge which is of great bliss to us all, it is our duty to propagate it to the human race. For it is something they really need. 

In the world there is suffering, hatred and dissatisfaction. That fact does not need proof. It is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment. No one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this. The world is looking for the Perfect Master to come and reveal the Perfect Knowledge of God. There is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the Perfect Masters coem to reveal this Knowledge to people. We can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace, for peace lies inside not outside in materialism. 

As you all know Millenium '73 is being prepared for now. This festival has been organized by Divine Light Mission each year since 1967, in the memory of the late Satgurudev Shri Hans Ji Maharaji on His birthday. This year the most Holy and significant event in human history will take place in America. 

I think that Millenium '73 is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies; and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner. 

To do this I really need your help. I really need the help of all the premies in all respects; physically, financially and all other ways to make Millenium '73 come off. This is a festival not for you or me. It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe. 

I hereby invite you to this Divine Festival of Peace, Millenium '73 and request all premies to help me financially, physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of Truth. 

Isn't it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this Earth? 

Blessings to you all, 

[Sant Ji Maharaj] 

 
It is clear, when you contrast Geaves' claim with the documentary evidence, that Geaves, bless his heart, is playing the role of the typical cult apologist, lying about his leader and blaming the followers, the press, anyone at all, for the inexcusable, laughable excesses of the cult.  What's particularly worrying about Geaves, I'm sure you can appreciate, is that, as a religious studies professor, he's imbued with a certain authority that",0

It appears, Ron, that you are frustratingly reading my paragraph above as if that is what I want to put in the article, when what I want to put in the article is posted on my talk page in one place so that it can be seen without continually being pushed up by discussion. My comment above is only *explanation*.

Sigh. Here again is what I want to put in the article. It's on my talk page. Sigh:

""""1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning """"short sword""""; confusion about the derivation of """"Shotokan"""" may occur otherwise. The Kanji for shoto, """"pine waves"""", is (松涛). The first character is (松), which means pine tree. The second character (涛) is a kanji variant of (濤), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (小刀). The first character is (小), meaning small, and the second character is (刀), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw """"松涛"""" would not mistake it.""""

You say that you do not *agree* with this, but you cannot seem to explain what is *wrong* with it. It would make no claim whatsoever, when posted in the article, to any reasonable person, that the """"short sword"""" story is being told out there (even though it is; I just don't have it in a book for you, so I'm not trying to claim it on Wikipedia). It can be looked at as *preemptively* preventing confusion.

For someone who says he wants to work together, you are laying down a lot of conditions. I think it is reasonable to say at least:

""""1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning """"short sword"""". The Kanji for shoto, """"pine waves"""", is (松涛). The first character is (松), which means pine tree. The second character (涛) is a kanji variant of (濤), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (小刀). The first character is (小), meaning small, and the second character is (刀), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw """"松涛"""" would not mistake it.""""

I think it's reasonable of me to dispute not showing the Kanji and it's reasonable of me to dispute not having that first sentence that basically says """"Note that this use of shotodoes not mean """"short sword""""."""" If you want to put in that sentence rather than """"Not to be confused with..."""" that would be fine with me.  08:32""",0

 Lesbian and Dyke (slang) articles  

Hello, Lionhead99. If you have checked the edit history of the Lesbian article before, which I believe that you have, you will see that your edits were reverted twice at that article, once by , with me elaborating on Wikiwind's revert for why your edits were reverted, and now by me. Those edit summaries clearly explain why you were reverted. Waiting a month later to restore most of it does not change the issue with your edit. It's not like most people who were watching an article stop watching it a month later and aren't going to notice what is mostly the same change that they objected to before. 

As I've stated, the lead isn't saying that being lesbian is a choice; it's saying whether or not to identify as lesbian is a choice; sexual identity is not always the same as sexual orientation, which I explained to a different person in September of this year on the Lesbian talk page. Your edits, among other things, removed material that addresses the important ways that the term """"lesbian"""" is used, material that is partly a summary of the Sexuality and lesbian identity section. Per WP:LEAD, the lead is supposed to """"summarize the most important points—including any prominent controversies."""" Partially because """"lesbian"""" is often not consistently defined in the same way by women who use the term to describe their sexuality, it often is not consistently defined in the same way by researchers (see page 22). The Lesbian article is a big article; so it, of course, makes sense that its lead is four paragraphs, which is the advised limit for the lead. Leads may or may not include sources, as what is in the lead should be sourced in the lower body of the article and since sourcing the lead is a case-by-case matter. See Wikipedia:Lead#Citations. And WP:OVERLINKING is not good.

It should also help that  changed the """"About""""/disambiguation tag to identify that this article is not just about sexual orientation: """"This article is about the term Lesbian and female homosexuality. For the sexual orientation in general, see Homosexuality.""""

I also reverted you at the Dyke (slang) article, because, """"The term is not always pejorative anymore, as the lead notes. 'Dyke' is used very often among gay and bisexual-identified women without negative connotation. 'Sissy' or 'faggot' not as much to the same extent by gay men.""""   """,0

 Dealing with Geaves' trustworthiness as a Rawat scholar 

Rather than get into another reversion war, I'll do it this way.  I propose posting the same paragraph I put up the other day.  Obviously, you premies don't like it but the fact is, it's apparent beyond question that Geaves has misrepresented the truth about Rawat's role in the Millenium hype.

Geaves said:

In November 1973, Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome, a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90,000.  The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S.  with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors.  Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations.  He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.

Whereas, in a broadly-disseminated letter to all his followers, Rawat described the upcoming program as the """"most Holy and significant event in human history"""", intimated that the festival wasn't just for him and his followers but the whole world, """"and maybe the whole universe"""" and suggested that it was time for his followers to help him """"bring peace to this Earth.""""

Any fair reader can clearly see the serious discrepancy between Geaves' account and the documentary evidence.""",0

FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION
Dr Philip Opas (defence lawyer for Ryan, recently deceased) made it public knowledge that he did not, and would never endorse Richards book The Hanged Man, because the facts surrounding Ryan life and case had been manipulated. The book was published 35 years after Ryan's hanging - only after almost every person directly involved in the Ryan case had died, making allegations by Richards impossible to retort or confirm as fact. Richards tried but failed  to bluff Opas to support the book by signing it inside the front cover, """"To Philip and Stella from Mike Richards"""". But it's no surprise that the highly intelligence and most experienced Opas was not easily fooled by anyone. The book became a toilet item.
It's ironic that User:Purrum promotes and contributes to the Ryan article from two books, which not only contradict each other, but have also been exposed to contain lies. For unknown reasons User:Purrum deliberately ignores the mega referenced articles published over four decades that acknowledge the facts.

Unless you're a newly hatched pod person, you already know that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation is not only truculent but is addicted to being truculent. But let me add that when Positive and Negative Merger Foundation promotes the idea of a """"global village"""" it secretly means """"global pillage"""". What follows is a set of observations I have made about condescending jokers. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's idolators have already started to rob, steal, cheat, and murder. The result: absolute vapidity, shallow and postmodernist cacophony, lack of personality, monotony, and boredom. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation likes scare tactics that bar people from partaking in activities that cannot be monitored and controlled. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that I have to wonder where it got the idea that it is my view that """"metanarratives"""" are the root of tyranny, lawlessness, overpopulation, racial hatred, world hunger, disease, and rank stupidity. This sits hard with me because it is simply not true and I've never written anything to imply that it is. 
If some people are offended by my mentioning that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's vicegerents believe a conspiracy of purblind spoilsports control banking, foreign policy, and the media, then so be it. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's asseverations are in every respect consistent with the school of huffy thought that tends to dilute the nation's sense of common purpose and shared sacrifice. When I state that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation is a faithful student of Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese strategist who advocated demoralizing one's enemy as the highest art of warfare, I'm merely trying to deal with the relevant facts. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's true goal is to palm off our present situation as the compelling ground for worldwide deconstructionism. All the statements that its operatives make to justify or downplay that goal are only apologetics; they do nothing to build bridges where in the past all that existed were moats and drawbridges. 
Despite what you may have been taught in school, I welcome Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's comments. However, Positive and Negative Merger Foundation needs to realize that we must undeniably raise a stink about Positive and Negative Merger Foundation and its insipid perversions. Does that sound extremist? Is it too brainless for you? I'm sorry if it seems that way but that's life. Given Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's record of shady dealings, we can say that its squibs are eerily similar to those promoted by madmen such as Pol Pot. What's scary, though, is that their extollment of commercialism has been ratcheted up a few notches from anything Pol Pot ever conjured up. In summary, things are apt to get worse before they get better. Is anyone listening? Does anyone care?""",0
""":::""""#The one where you add """"and sometimes unfortunately"""". You drift into pure editorializing; this needs some other formulation that isn't a pure projection of your opinion and/or personal experiences. I happen to be a champion within the Waldorf movement of revising the emphasis on the eight-year class teacher period. But the opposite of """"brochure speak"""" is """"antagonist speak""""; both may make statements that appear clear, objective and meaningful to the person making them - but are too broad and too vague simultaneously. It is """"weasel"""" language; unattributed, both unprovable and undisprovable. """"  The percentage of teachers who make it through 8 years with a single class is staggeringly LOW - so what starts as a lofty goal often ends up as an interruption of the children's education - and often under difficult circumstances.  Making the claim that a teacher stays with the class for 8 years is brochure speech not supported by reality.  It's like saying - """"it is the intention of each baseball player to bat 1000"""".  It is meaningless except for the purpose of sucking people into a set of ideals that aren't part of reality.  If you don't like the statement that points out the reality of the situation, then we should remove the claim completely.

""""#The wholesale removal of the section on rhythm in the kindergarten. It needed revision, but not removal. I would replace it with something like: """"Waldorf early-childhood pedagogy believes that clear daily and weekly rhythms are essential for the child's healthy development and emotional security. [citation] [reference to the elements of this rhythm] It also believes that both the seasons and festivals relating to the course of the year provide central formative experiences.[citation]"""" This is a huge part of Waldorf's approach to early-childhood education and needs mention.""""  I don't disagree that this is part of the pedagogy, but the wording has to be concise.  """"Essential for the child's healthy development and emotional security"""" - you sound like Donald Rumsfeld with your terrorist scare tactics here.  Yes, let's all just scare the parents into Waldorf education.  How about just saying """"rhythms during the day and through the year are thought to be important""""?  What you wrote above is the type of brochure speech that riddles this article and makes it impossible to view it as other than a advertisement.

""""Others of your edits I have already revised and a middle ground has been found; this process will continue, I would expect. I have not been reverting your edits generally; only blatant editorializing (which I have sometimes managed to convert into something meaningful)."""" Your """"middle ground"""" and mine are in very different places, my friend.  Blatant editorializing is what my edits have been removing.  Just because I haven't had time to go back and re-word what you believe you have made """"meaningful"""" doesn't mean it has any validity in this article.  As long as you, a Waldorf teacher, is here making this article """"meaningful"""" - there will be no end to the controversy here.

""""The tag should go because it is presently unjustified, as you all agree; it is inaccurate in its present form; why are you advocating keeping something that is not accurate? If it becomes accurate, it should go back; that's easy enough to do."""" Nobody agrees - as far as I know, with what you have said above - although one polemic editor besides yourself did remove the tag.  The tag is completely justified.  Here's the next paragraph that needs brochure speech removed: 

""""According to Steiner, the child at this early stage learns through imitation and example,[4] so in Waldorf it is considered best to surround him with the goodness of the world and caring, practically active adults to emulate. The curriculum attempts to awaken the child's will and initiative; the teacher has the responsibility for providing an environment that stimulates imitation. In Waldorf, such an environment is believed to support the physical and spiritual growth of the child. Formal learning is absent, and experiences of the written language are consciously avoided. Oral language development is addressed through circle games (songs, poems and games in movement), daily story time (normally recited from memory) and the range of practical activities.""""

And there are more and more similar paragraphs that require lots of work.  I'm sorry if it is offensive to you as a Waldorf teacher, to find out that lots and lots of people besides you feel it is best to surround children with goodness.  In fact, maybe you should point out schools who, as their goal, consider it best to surround children with something other than goodness.  There is absolutely no justification for removing the tag while this type of language fills the article.  There was, at one time, a promise of a re-write of the article (most of which, I belie",0

 A simple technical question 

Dear Modernist - 

Excust my ignorance, but I'm having some difficulties with some of the """"alternative"""" citation/reference methods; I'm not finding the info I need at the usual webpages. Who can I ask for remedial information; I'll take a chance asking you.

Here's an example question: How do I use the cit/ref system used at the Emily Dickinson page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson (if you go there, you'll quickly see that only one method is used at that site)

I can establish say """"Wolff p. 55"""", but how do I link it to the reference (author/title/publisher/page)? 

And add to that: what if you have two citations from the same author, but each from a different book - how can you tell which citation goes to which source?

So far the editing methods I've use at other pages are discernable from looking at the edit pages and fooling around with them on sandbox; can't figure this one out. Can you explain it to me?

Glad to read you will be trying some editing methods different than what you've been doing up to now. I've been a Wikipedia contributor since early January 2005. I'm not an administrator. There's plenty I don't know…including how it can possibly be that despite a giant chorus of editors and admins telling you you are violating WP:OWN, you continue to insist there's no ownership issue, and that you're right and everyone else is wrong. You seem to feel that the AN/I case was opened to harrass you. In fact, it was opened to prevent much worse consequences (such as your being banned from editing Chevrolet Vega, or from editing at all) down the line. I tried — as did many others — to help you understand the problem. You flatly refuse to do so, and for that reason I have great difficulty taking this present friendly chat of yours at face value. You've got an awful track record to rectify, and as of just a few hours ago you were still building that bad track record. Perhaps that's just face-saving bluster, and your behaviour really is going to change quickly and substantially. I hope so, because you obviously have a great deal to bring to the project. But your long record of crummy behaviour makes that hope extremely thin. Please prove me wrong. — T·C""",0

"World Serpent Distribution 

Hi 

I see my revisions of the WSD page were undone in preference older page.
The information on the current page is full of misinformation and untruths regarding WSD.
The company was never bankrupt and neither were any of the 3 Directors associated with it.
There was never any court case either.
It is a real pity that nearly 10 yeas after WSD closed down, nobody has bothered to check Companies House or the Royal Courts of Justice.
WSD ceased trading in August 2004, with all stock being returned and delivered to all the artists/bands who requested it.
Some chose to collect in person, some decided not to bother!
For a more accurate portrayal on WSD maybe reference the following:
www.headheritage.co.uk from August 30th 2004 a statement from David Tibet of Current 93.
A small extract:More news on World Serpent...part 1
Aug 30, 2004, 18:37
From David Tibet at Durtro.com

World Serpent: The Carnival is Over

The past and the future

THE PAST (bad trip): As many of you may have heard by now, World Serpent Distribution have ceased trading.

Current 93 and Nurse With Wound, as well as many other groups, have worked with them almost exclusively since 1989. We felt a great closeness with all three of them: Alison Webster, David Gibson and Alan Trench, and they were both our colleagues and our friends. We are very proud of all the work we did together and the beautiful material and editions we issued with and through them. We would like to thank them for all that they have done on our behalf and wish them the best of luck with their futures, and hope we shall all keep in touch remembering the halcyon days and not the unsettled end.
Also Alan Trench's interview for African Paper from March 2012 available online where he expands on the aborted legal action by douglas pearce.
All i was trying to do was redress the balance, as looking at a completely inaccurate and misleading page on WSD is somewhat sad.
I don't think for one minute this will make a difference but if it does then it will go someway to redressing a great injustice.
They deserve better!
Thanks

 ODNBsub

I can see the reasons why having a consistent format with  is a good idea, but until this edit of yours ODNBsub hadn't had brackets since Feb 2010. Adding brackets then meant that we ended up with double brackets when ODNBsub was used in the """"|format="""" parameter of , for example.  So, as a fix for now at least, I've added the formatting directly and eliminated the brackets. This means that people will need to add brackets if they want them but won't be stuck with double brackets.  It does mean that the brackets aren't in the same font style as the message, though (e.g. Boden Professor of Sanskrit election, 1860, which is still accepting comments at peer review by the way... ).

PLEASE DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS NOTE. THE WHOLE SUPRA-SECTION WILL DISAPPEAR AGAIN ONCE I AM ABLE TO POST ON THE ARTICLE TALK PAGE.

This includes you Shell. Had you not blocked me, I would have been able to place my answers there. This will disappear tomorrow so you can put with it until then.

Because Shell falsely blocked me, I cannot save my replies on a certain article talk page. Hence I will save the entire page (minus the archived sections) here.

 POV concerns 

Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation

""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""""

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for """"Criticisms of Islam"""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"criticisms of Islam"""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.

Good day.

  

Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where """"treason"""" or """"traitor"""" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   

Changes by Devotus and issues with them

Dear Devotus, 
I have still issues with your changes:
Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from """"each side"""" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.
While your first version was needlessly verbose (""""it is to be noted that""""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.
Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the """"siege and demise"""", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.
Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict. We fought hard and long about words like """"massacre"""" and """"execution"""" and neither should appear unless unavoidable.

 Cleaning up 

Here's what I'm about to do to clean up this messy page.
First of all, sporange does not rhyme with orange, as clearly stated in the usage note. I will be moving it into the list.
Secondly, the section regarding orange, purple, silver, and month will be retitled """"Words with obscure perfect rhymes"""".
Thirdly, the terms bulb, eighth, elbow, and of will be removed. Here is my justification:
No matter how obscure the rhyme, if it has a perfect rhyme, it must not be one the list. Bulb rhymes with culb, so it will be removed. Simple as that.
Eighth is a perfect rhyme for weighth, an alternative spelling and pronunciation of weight- compare heighth.
Elbow rhymes with beelbow, as was pointed out above.

Gender equality is one of this project's central concepts. It was AWOL.
(reposted from Portal_talk:Feminism)

Essentially, variations on Gender equality had been hijacked six or so months ago by redirects to both Zygarchy and Equalism, and had actually begun to affect the conversation across the internet. 

This is bad news, as these terms have nothing behind them but ill-defined assertions. I've rarely been embarrassed for Wikipedia, but this is one of those moments where the site's power was left in the hands of POV/OR mischief-makers.

""""Zygarchy"""" is a made-up word that would never meet the WP:NEO standard if anyone had caught it. It has never meant """"rule of two genders"""" before someone asserted it on Wikipedia. There are a couple hundred blogs out there crowing about the """"new word they'd learned"""" while learning less than zero about notable, verifiable internationally-established gender policy. (Somewhat ominously, """"zygarchy"""" is an obscure but genuine term for an ancient military formation involving two chariots. I think the chariots were used to run infantry over... or to cut them down with a chain between them...)

""""Equalism"""" has been used by notable sources and scholars but never consistently. There was some effort to use it to refer to communism in the fifties, anarchism at various points, and some among the Facebook crowd seem to like it better than """"feminism""""; one news citation in Sweden counts it as a subset of feminism. That is to say, it's a semantic game: There is no """"-ism"""" there, just a desire for one, a moving target without a developed philosophy behind it. I've redirected it to a far more notable article, Egalitarianism.

Nearly every instance of a wikilink to Gender equality had been piped to Equalism. That's what last night was all about for me: finding and removing the plumbing from this phantasm.

I've reestablished the Gender equality article with cites to the UN and an external link to the World Bank. I've added it to the various gender studies and feminism templates. This is one of this project's central concepts, and we really have to watch these pages. Cheers,  ✉ """,0

 A great and grand success.... 

  Moment of Joy! What brought me to Wikipedia was the lack of information in the article of Meera. In mid-April 2012, after spending nearly 3 and a half months, I planned to add to those article which are seldom edited by others. Those included the Nawabs of Bengal & Murshidabad, articles related to it and soap opera articles. Soap operas are ongoing so I have to edit them daily but the article on the Nawabs is a piece of history...and I took up the work alone. Later, in May some editors helped me to fix typos and grammatical errors, but soon withdrew back their help. But, by God's grace I finished with the work today on 4 August 2012 and would love to share this success with you! My condition was same as the flying man in the pic, trying to catch a several things at the same time before it's too late. I don't know whether he succeeds or not, bu I did succeed! However, I still have to add some references and summarize the plots of soap opera articles in the soap opera articles. If you want, then you can help.

"Unbelieveable. Absolutely unbelieveable. It had slipped my mind that I actually did try once more to knock some sense in with that remark on the infallible doctor's talk page. That was a mistake. A momentary lapse of reason. I'd somehow got it into my head that somehow, someway, just the slightest degree of sensibility would kick in. I'd forgotten that logic has no place here.

Clio basically told Dirk he doesn't know shit, and so I basically parrotted that back to her in order to try to point out to you guys once again for the zillionth time that you're letting her get away with murder.

And then came the ugliness. I'd forgotten about the whole thing until just now when I noticed in my contributions that I'd apparently made a remark on her page. Talk about a personal attack. I swear I've rarely seen such sickening thoughts put into words. And all about me. Such anger, such twisted hatred, such disturbed imagery...

No. I don't care how irritating this whole thing is. It's not worth it. This girl is not well, and NEITHER of us are helping. Haven't you noticed how many regulars have simply stopped editing out of frustration? Haven't you noticed how pretty much every question is answered by the same person? Do you not realize how responsibile you are for having actively participated in the transformation of the Humanities RefDesk from once being a vibrant place where one could find a multifaceted, multidimensional answer written by a variety of differing editors, each with his own invaluable unique insights and perspectives, into the stale, single-faceted unidimensional, useless place it is now?

No. It's not worth it. It's futile. Worse actually. Perhaps I share in some of the blame myself. If it wasn't for my relentless protestations, perhaps the whole thing would have blown over, Clio would have gotten bored of the Humanities RefDesk, moved on, and it wouldn't be the cold, sterile place it is now.

Perhaps I lost perspective, and didn't realize the magnitude of the harm that my persistent challenges could potentially inflict on a very fragile and terribly imbalanced young mind.

Just please read the damn thing over, Rockpocket. Here it is:  . Those rants of hers are clearly not the product of a healthy mind. I recognize that now. I have to stop. What I'm doing is wrong. So to all who will inevitably read this, I say publicly to Clio:

You win. I lose. You're right. I'm wrong. You're smart and you were right all along, I'm an intellectually impoverished imbecile. Yes, as you say, I'm pathetic. I'm honestly, genuinely sorry for having caused you such grief. I don't belong editing here on Wikipedia as I can't even approach your level of intelligence.

It is essential that the Able Danger debate be carried out in the places where it is relevant.  It is simply not relevant here.  If you can find legitimate news sources or counterterrorism analysts who provide a justification for its relevance here then it will be worth considering but right now it has no relevance whatsoever.  Your speculation about the credibility of the 9/11 Commission on issues not addressed by Able Danger is just pure speculation.  From someone, I might add, whose own credibility is very much in question.  I will continue to delete references to Able Danger until someone establishes their relevance in a meaningful way, not through a string of random speculations barely tied together by a thread like the above.  And again, let us please remember that the 9/11 Commission is not the issue here anyway.  The commission is cited but the pieces of evidence they look at are all pieces of intelligence brought out by other agencies.  As for the arrest of Iraqis in Germany, again, if you find evidence or even authoritative speculation tying those arrests to Able Danger we can consider it - otherwise it is just a string of increasingly bankrupt attempts at pseudo-logic. 05:11",0

"""::::Jmabel; in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims """"despite """"Third Way"""" rhetoric, fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a right-wing force""""? As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all. The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a """"Third Way"""" as the references show.

The only dissenters I'm aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. For example, even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism, and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy, Renzo De Felice doesn't try to """"cover up"""" its socialistic origins and third way status. This is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on Mussolini. -

Hi. I noticed that you reverted my revertion on Kunigami language. Ryulong is indeed acting as a vandal. Without justifiable reason, he is mass-removing content with reliable sources (I found that I have cited 21 unique sources).

When we have two competing versions of an article, article with and without much information, it is reasonable to choose the former as a working version. I have never heard of any restrictive policy in Wikipedia: we can add content only if we reach consensus to do so. Quite the opposite.

Elementary algebra may explains to readers certain core complex number ideas quite well, but I only put it out there for discussion.  Argand diagrams made complex numbers respectable.  These diagrams are metaphors, far from exact ones, of the imaginary field, yet appear in the article. Imaginary numbers are not yet points.  Keith Devlin wrote """"since the complex numbers are not points on a line, you cannot say which of two complex numbers is the larger; for the complex numbers there is no such notion."""" Yet he also stated """"There is, however, a notion of size of sorts.  The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is the distance from the origin to the number."""" [Devlin, Keith, The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible Macmillan, 2000: 133.} Desmond Fearnley-Sander explains that """"From a geometric point of viuew, complex numbers are not points but ratios of vectors."""" [Fearnley-Sander, Desmond, Plane Euclidean Reasoning, in Automated Deduction in Geometry, 2nd International Workshop, ed. Gao, X, et. al,  Beijing, China 1998, Google eBook: 108] They're the clock hand that points to the hour, not the hour point. 

Consistent with this logic, it's better to consider the plane rotating under the complex vector than the vector itself.  This sidesteps the variability of complex number position: its the plane's fault, if you will.  Want this grounded in mathematical foundations?  Look no further than the Riemann hypothesis.

Riemann extended Euler's zeta function, which Euler developed to find prime numbers, to define complex numbers.  Riemann's wanted to prove Euler's conjecture, which he attacked by solving complex solutions to f(zeta) = 0.  Riemann found x + iy, where x lies between 0 and 1, has infinitely many solutions.  He proposed they all (except negative even integers) are of form 1/2 + iy.  Computer tests find the first 1.5 billion f(z) = 0 (called z(s)) solutions lie on the line x = 1/2 in the complex plane.  But inductive evidence does not mathematically prove anything, and the Riemann hypothesis remains perhaps the most important unsolved problem of our era.

The only singularity of z(s) is the simple pole at s, or 1. There is no reason to assume complex numbers are points.  I don't believe this is non-standard. It is profound and documented.

4th paragraph
The 4th paragraph is wrong. 

The black body temperature of the Earth is 5.5 °C.[4] Since the Earth reflects about 28% of incoming sunlight[5], in the absence of the greenhouse effect the planet's mean temperature would be far lower - about -18 or -19 °C [6][7] instead of the much higher current mean temperature, about 14 °C.

The black body temperature of the Earth is -18 or -19 °C, not 5.5 °C (which is the temperature of an ideal blackbody the same distance from the Sun as the Earth). It was correct before it was changed on Dec 9,2009. Also, reference [4] does not support that statement. I suggest the following as a possible replacement paragraph and even as a possible first paragraph since it actually defines what Greenhouse Effect really refers to.

If an ideal thermally conductive blackbody was the same distance from the Sun as the Earth, it would have an expected blackbody temperature of 5.3 °C. However, since the Earth reflects about 30%NASA Earth Fact Sheet (or 28%Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry, by Daniel J. Jacob, Princeton University Press, 1999. Chapter 7, """"The Greenhouse Effect"""".) of the incoming sunlight, the planet's actual blackbody temperature is about -18 or -19 °C Solar Radiation and the Earth's Energy BalanceIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. Chapter 1: Historical overview of climate change science page 97, about 33°C below the actual surface temperature of about 14 °C or 15 °C.The elusive """"absolute surface air temperature,"""" see GISS discussion The mechanism that produces this difference between the actual temperature and the blackbody temperature is due to the atmosphere and is known as the Greenhouse Effect.

Note that I also modified the expected temperature and albedo based on NASA data. If the values in the current paragraph are used in Stephan's equation, 5.5°C with no reflection is associated with -16.5°C with 28% reflection and -18°C with 30%.   """,0

Sorry, but I'm not here to appease your """"getting offended"""" radar.

That's his right to do so if he wants to and he should not get into trouble because of it, since, last I checked, the 1st amendment was still valid in America (or so they say). What next?

Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs

"Notable alumni ==

This section badly needs cleaning up. I am happy so to do but I should like to seek support, here, first. A prerequisite is that attendance at the school should be reliably sourced - no source must mean no inclusion. The second prerequisite is notability. A page is not needed to demonstrate notability but it helps! Looking at the red-links some have no claims to notability and for some the claims can be simply tested. Take Mike Pointing for example. If he has played in a competitive match for Harlequins first team then he meets WP:Athlete. If he has just played for their academy then he doesn't. If Michael Latham is an influential film-maker why doesn't he have a page? My view is that if an editor thinks that an alumnus is notable and feels strongly that they should be included in this list then write a stub! It is always quicker to write a stub than have a long debate trying to establish their notability separately.

To deal with this situation efficiently I am proposing that red-linked or unsourced people should be moved here. This preserves the information that we have about them and they can then be moved back to the article as sources are found or notability is demonstrated. Views, please.   

I'm with you, TerriersFan. Move the redlinks here or give a diff to the deletion; they can be added back when the burden of proof is met.   

I too agree with your suggestion. Thanks for taking this on.

""":Hi Virinchi, There are a lot of problems with the article in its current state, which is why this page has been so quickly nominated for """"speedy deletion"""" again. btw, instead of tagging that as {{proposed deletion}}, if you are the original author of the article and no one else has made major contributions, you can tag it with {{db-self}} which makes the process much simpler. Here are some suggestions 

Don't use personal pronouns like 'we'.
Don't use sentences with heavily connoted and unverifiable words or phrases like """"...leaflet campaign, which took the city by storm."""" or """"The effect it had on the first IPL match was fascinating"""" Instead, simply say the result of the leaflet campaign (to the extent verifiable by your source) in a neutral voice eg: """"In preparation for the next IPL match, No Dada No KKR used leaflet and sms campaigns, and purchased tickets off would-be match attendants to encourage boycotting and create artificial scarcity which resulted in lower turnout in the cricket match."""" Note that even this sentence has a problem: 'lower turnout' can't be verified by that source because it would be quoting an obviously biased primary source.
Don't say things like """"greatest ever captain"""", sentences like this are clearly expressing an opinion.
Don't use slang like 'kids'.
Don't discuss the future (WP:FUTURE)

I think the reading which would help you the most are WP:WORDS and WP:NPOV for help with the non-neutral tone of your article and WP:N and WP:RS for properly citing and providing evidence of notability of the group.

Best of luck,  Rodney

"Hello I would like to raise a concern that there are two vandals User:Noclador & User:MrMacMan they have been editing all articles that have to do with the Albanian military non are correct I have been blocked in two occasions for no reason, I have tried talking with them and reasoning with them but they are not listening they even changed the my words that I put in their discussion are to seem like I was attacking them so I would get banned, I would really appreciate if you take some action against these users, they have only provided one source for their edit that is 3 years old and even that does not match with he figures and information they have given, in their source it states that Albania operates 375 tanks and User:Noclador wrote that the tank inventory is only 79 which does not match at all with his source, every time I fix the information so it matches with his source he reverts it, I also have added the PVO banner because me and some other people do not agree with their sources and they keep removing it.

 Immature edits by immature people 

Your proposed """"cheerleader editnotice"""" is a strong, not-very-friendly solution to a problem that historically has been solved with honey.  The historical way of dealing with editors who are immature is to watchlist articles likely to attract them, revert them, kindly explain why they were reverted using a welcome template or an individualized note, and point them to the right way of doing this.

Wikipedia is largely edited by adults, for adults, using social constructs familiar to adults.  It's not MySpace or cartoon-pedia, or AllThingsDisneyWiki.com, and it's not a teen hang-out or kid's playground.  The social rules that junior high and elementary school students use day-in-day-out are quite different from those of Wikipedia, and WP:BITE says we have to be understanding of this and use a velvet glove approach.

I don't run across very many editors who """"seem"""" young by their edits, but most of those I do don't last long.  I can understand why - socially, it's just not a good fit.  A my-school-pedia about their school and town, edited by them for them, would be a much better fit and much more enjoyable for them.  /(talk)/(contribs)/(e-mail) """,0

In its modern form, racism evolved in tandem with European exploration, conquest, and colonization of much of the rest of the world, and especially after Christopher Columbus reached the Americas.  As new peoples were encountered, fought, and ultimately subdued, theories about """"race"""" began to develop, and these helped many to justify the differences in position and treatment of people whom they categorized as belonging to different races (see Eric Wolf's Europe and the People Without History).  Some people like Juan Gines de Sepulveda even argued that the Native Americans were natural slaves.

 Distribution of Obscene Material to Minors 

Dear Anthere-

I am very pleased with this service, and have used it a great deal.

Unfortunately, it occurred to me to check on some of the articles that my children might utilize, and was quite badly shocked.

From what I can tell, this site is not in compliance with the applicable regulations of the State of Florida (or my own state, Virginia) concerning the distribution of pornography to minors.  Obviously, that is a decision to be made by the appropriate legal authorities.  Given that I do not wish to be complicit in what is apparently an illegal activity, I am ending my contributions to this site.  It is my hope that this encyclopedia will be a resource for our children as well as ourselves.

I would very much like to continue to participate, and I certainly recognize the impossibility of immediately censoring any article which breaks a law anywhere.  At the same time, reviewing your policy pages it appears that a very few people are responsible for this behavior, and that no coherent policy is in force.  Additionally, given the size of the effort, it is difficult for me to appreciate that the word """"consensus"""", which appears quite often, is being used appropriately.

While I obviously worry for my children's welfare and upbringing, I am more concerned, at this juncture, in being involved in an activity with appears to be illegal (to whit, a class 3 felony in the state of Florida).

I understand your policies on censorship.  At the same time, most pornography web sites carry disclaimers regarding """"you must be 18 years or older to enter, click here to so state"""".  Given that there is no such disclaimer, and that the inclusion would harm the effectiveness of this site, I am at a loss for how you should proceed.

I have, on my user page, outlined the various agencies to whose attention I would like to bring this matter to, and offer you, as Chairman of the Wikifoundation, the opportunity to discuss this with me before I take these actions.  I am quite sure that the majority of members have no interest in participating in an activity which would appear to be other that what it is:  an encyclopedia.

My best wishes for yourself and your family.

Do prototypes necessarily use a sort of """"prototyping"""" material? Aren't models made of a different material called a mockup or something of the sort? In that case, the chef example above doesn't work - the new creations are prototypes. 
As for the others, the newspaper industry does use prototypes. That is, the first version referred to above. The first version is the definition of prototype - the prototype is the first version.
The coal industry could benefit greatly from prototypes, and I'm sure they use them already. There are immense safety concerns, to name one only area in which a model, perhaps not full-sized, of a coal mine would work. Additionally, the coal mines themselves are not the only asset of the coal industry - you have countless types of vehicles, mining equipment, and support equipment.
Milking cows - there would of course be no cow prototypes, as cows are not the product of the dairy industry. Instead, milk is. And I would hope there is prototype milk - a sample of the milk throughout its development cycle to make sure it is safe and clean.
As for pet stores, it is right that they would doubtless have a need for a prototype. However, a prototype is used for a product. A pet store has no """"products"""", instead they offer a service. They do not produce pets, they recieve and sell them. Even pet breeders do not produce the pets, they just reap the benefits of reproduction.

Hello 71, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thanks for the question. One of the most basic rules here is that information in articles must be """"sourced"""" to a """"reliable source,"""" which is explained here: WP:RS. In the case of the Montana edit that you made, all the published sources list Joe's birthplace as New Eagle, Pennsylvania. If you have a published source that says Butte, Montana, you would have to insert it after the edit that you make. One way to do this is to click on the open book icon above the editing window to the left of """"Advanced."""" A dialogue box will appear in which you can paste the URL for your source, or you can list the publication. The preferred method for sourcing, though, is listed here: WP:CT.

Unfortunately, insider information like knowing JM's son cannot be used as a source. Sources must be reliable and published, as above. I have some firsthand experience with this.

 Reply 
Hi there, since you do not wish to have a united article representing all point of views and would like to stick to your point of view, I have no rights to prevent you other than that of a fellow wikipedian from South Asia. I have divided both the pages under discussion into two parts. One for Government point of view and one for refugee point of view. Since there is no neutral or united point of view, I will not be editing or discussing in those pages as actively as I have been doing. Besides, I can not prepare for my exams with no other than my fellow South Asian accusing me of fancy accusitions in place no other than wikipedia. Here is something that I have to say as regards your recent posts in this page:

 About:
Eukesh, you say all the right things, that we need a neutral article, that you want to be constructive, but at the end of it, it seems your mind is closed. You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet. isn't that where all that garbage is available? you say you want to be constructive but you are already fixed in your view that all the ethnic nepalese people in the camps are from bhutan. FYI, if they’re not from Nepal, it could be they are from india also, ie, not necessarily from Bhutan. being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed. you can count the number of poor nepalese without any documents who are finding their way to india every day. if ever there was a census to be done between nepal and india, you will find millions ‘stateless’ by your definition, definitely in the hundreds of thousands. is bhutan responsible for that? is it inconceivable to you that some of them might have made their way to bhutan? You conclude that it is 'entirely a Bhutanese issue' and nothing could be further from the truth. If nepal wasn't quite the economic basketcase it has become, maybe the rest of us in the region wouldn't have to deal with such an outflow of emigrants from your country. 

About:
 """"You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet."""" 

Please do not comment about Nepalese press in a nation where it has played a major part in bringing a revolution from a nation where there is virtually no press. The press here is not garbage. However, I did not care about the Bhutanese refugee case until I found that it was missing here and thought of writing about it.

About:
 """"You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet. isn't that where all that garbage is available?""""

Wikipedia is available in net. Do you call it garbage? I have cited the information from sites of globally accepted bodies and not from the sites hosted by some pro- or anti- groups or some blog pages

About:

FYI, if they’re not from Nepal, it could be they are from india also, ie, not necessarily from Bhutan. being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed.

I do not have a point of view. I agree that I have made some points which were offensive to some, but it was not intentional and were derived from the data. There was a speculation which was corrected later. I just posted what were there in websites of UNHCR and other global organizations which is something that is done in wikipedia. I have told you that people of Nepalese origin are found throughout the world. Many might be stateless. However, the reports of UNHCR shows otherwise in case of Bhutanese refugees. If you can change their view, please do. Otherwise stop editing with whatever you wish to write or in your own words, stop garbaging wikipedia.

 About """"being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed."""" Well, there is nothing which can top this sort of irresponsible comment.

Confused
Don't worry but I think somebody got confused while usign LHD and RHD back and forth beetwen different countries, so for example, Spain is LHD or RHD? the part about Gibraltar made me get confused about it.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 98.226.204.140   

Gibraltar has not been part of Spain since 1713, so the British authorities applied their own laws, including the rule of the road. By 1929, driving on on the left while having a land border with a country that drove on the right became impractical, so that's why Gibraltar change on 16 June of that year.  

History
Do we have any reliable evidence about the historic foundations of LHD/RHD are? I think the article could benefit from adding any info to this effect.
On numerous occasions, I have heard that left hand driving has its roots in knights passing each other with the lances in their right hand. However, i have never been able to find any evidence of this. 
  

-Please do excuse me for sounding a bit daft, but I'm not sure I understand the question. Isn't that what the entire article is about? In addition, I think the problems ascertaining the specific history are quite well-presented.   

Sweden
Under Safety factors it says
""""Research in 1969 by J. J. Leeming showed countries driving on the left have a lower collision rate than countries driving on the right. This research is questioned in Peter Kincaid's book on the rule of the road,[citation needed] but some countries that have switched to driving on the right, such as Sweden, have seen their long-term accident rates increase by more than any increase in traffic volume[citation needed]."""" The red part is totally made up, and the opposite is the truth. The number of accidents was cut in half from the first day of right hand driving, and has not increased substantually since then. Swedish right hand driver 83.255.35.43  

H'm. This what you're saying doesn't quite make sense, either. The number of crashes will surely have gone up since 1967. Perhaps you mean the crash rate (per vehicle-kilometre travelled, per thousand vehicles registered, etc.) has declined, which would make sense since that's what's been happening in just about every first-world country over the last four decades. 

Nevertheless, the assertion you call attention to is unsupported, has been for quite some time, and at the very least is questionable. We can remove it from the article unless/until someone cares to add it back with reliable support. — T·C

 Dagen H videos 
If anyone else has found this already and beaten me to it, I'm sorry to be redundant. After a long night of trolling the internet for hours I finally came across the holy grail of Dagen H-related video. Here's the link.

It's from TV Sveriges. That link will take you to the live television coverage from 4.45am to 5.15am. There's yet another clip from 5.15-5.30 and further clips down the right-hand menu to different reports throughout Sweden at different intervals throughout the day. It chronicles the entire switch in immense detail, though be warned that the dialogue is entirely in Swedish (as is the website) so its main function is simply for those of us who draw immense excitement from watching these events transpire. The site also hosts (further down) the news bulletins for the various anniversaries right up to 1997. Again, if this has been posted before, I'm sorry, but for those of you who haven't seen this before, happy viewing.   

Unfortunately, it's been removed. Thanks anyway.

"Infobox 

Okay. We have a disagreement about the infobox.
Let's try to work it out here, rather than edit warring over the article.

First off, let me present my position:
This is an encyclopediac article, or at least it should be. As such, it should contain all significantly relevant information, and it should prioritize the information someone would want to find most easily.
Kaiser's logo is relevant to anyone who wants to know about Kaiser, it seems Wikipedia considers the identity of the CEO of an organization relevant, and their website seems almost required - if someone, for instance, came to Wikipedia in order to find the website, they should be able to do so moderately easily; Kaiser's website should, in an article about Kaiser, stand out from all other links in some way.

Okay. someone who disagrees with me care to present your position on the situation?",0

 Texas Tech seal images 

I note that you reverted my replacement of Image:TTU Seal.svg, Image:TTUS Seal.svg and Image:TTUHSC Seal.svg with Image:Texas Tech CoA.png in their respective articles.  The reason I replaced them was twofold:

First of all, it simply seems to me that, at least for the TTU and TTUHSC articles (not so sure about TTUS) the Coat of Arms would more accurately reflect the overall visual identity of the institutions in question; according to the visual identity guidelines at , """"[t]he Official Seal and Signature are [...] reserved for use by the Office of the President of Texas Tech University and are used to represent the official business of the university"""", whereas the academic Coat of Arms is intended as a """"unified identity for all academic entities within the Texas Tech University System"""".  Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that """"[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University"""" and that """"[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature"""" (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it.

The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a).

Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility.

Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  """,0

Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called """"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what their ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. 
And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion towards Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries.

The link you provide states that """"45% of the rail market in Sweden is privatised"""" that therefore makes saying """"Rail transport in Sweden is privatised"""" a falsification if more than half of the entire market is still owned by the government. It doesn't matter whether the rail market was """"liberalised"""" into different companies under state ownership e.g. SJ, something cannot be described as """"privatised"""" if it retains a majority of government ownership, because it is therefore nationalised, the opposite of privatisation. To describe the Swedish rail market as privatised and then list a state owned company which comprises it in the very same sentence is nonsense and this is exactly what you have written.

""""Rail transport market is privatized and companies include SJ.........."""" - In this sentence you have made it sound as if SJ is a private company which is untrue, since if the person reading clicks the SJ hyperlink, they will be taken to an article which states unambiguously that SJ is a government owned enterprise.

A much better thing to do would be to explain that the majority of passenger transport by rail in Sweden is operated by state owned companies such as SJ as well as the government run Lokal Trafik in place within each of Sweden's Län such as HallandsTrafik, Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, SkåneTrafik etc. etc. etc. and THEN to explain that some sectors of rail transport are privatised such as the transport of cargo. This would therefore align the content of the article with the reference you presented above, which states that the majority of rail transport in Sweden is still government owned (with 45% being privatised).

Since judging by your other edits you are a right winger with a serious beef against anything government owned, you could then satisfy yourself by writing that state owned SJ isn't the most efficient of rail networks, something which a lot of Swedes themselves agree on as far as I have seen. In my own experience delays are common and travelling with SJ can be expensive.

My cite states that no notes issued prior to the """"greenbacks"""" were legal tender under the greenbacks and you would have known this if you had bothered to read he material I posted in the two wiki Fed articles. BTW: are you wise and omniscient ones (sarcasm) aware that Federal reserve notes were not legal tender until 1933?

lets see if you read it here 

I believe that Congress does NOT have the power to make paper money a legal tender and does not even have the power to make gold and silver a legal tender.The reference below show clearly that at least one US president and Funding Father agree with me on both counts and that at least two US presidents, and Founding Fathers agree with me on one count.

I hope that claims of original research and synthesis can now be put to rest as BOGUS.

An old NY times article http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res;=9501E2DB133BEE33A25751C1A9669D94679ED7CF references the following quotes

James Madison  - Thus the pretext for a paper currency and particularly for making the bill a legal tender, either for public or private debt, was cut off

Thomas Jefferson - I now deny their (Congress's) power of making paper money, or anything else, a legal tender

A Mr Benton who is also cited, states: The power granted to Congress to coin money is an authority to stamp metallic money, and is not an authority for emitting slips of paper containing promises to pay money.

Per Yale Law School records of the minutes of the vote to TAKE AWAY from Congress the power to """"emit bills of credit"""" during the Constitutional Convention as recorded by Founding Father and future president James Madison  http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_816.asp 

FN23 This vote in the affirmative by Virga. was occasioned by the acquiescence of Mr. Madison who became satisfied that striking out the words would not disable the Govt. from the use of public notes as far as they could be safe & proper; & would only cut off the pretext for a paper currency, [FN24] and particularly for making the bills a tender [FN24] either for public or private debts. 

and

""""Mr. Ghorum was for striking out, without inserting any prohibition. if the words stand they may suggest and lead to the measure.""""

My aside: The power to be struck out was the power to """"emit"""". Mr. Ghorum, (Madison misspelled the name - the person is actually Nathanial Gorham) states that if the words stand (the words being """"emit bills of credit"""") that """"they may suggest and lead to the measure"""" with the measure being printing legal tender paper money. To be ABSOLUTELY clear, this vote denied Congress the power to """"emit"""" per money, and strikes at the core of arguments in favor of paper money, because Congress cannot make paper money a legal tender because the power to print paper money was REMOVED from Congress. If Congress cannot even print paper money, how can it make it legal tender?

In Federalist 44 - Madison states 

The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it.

From Craig v Misouri

 The whole was intended to exclude everything from use as a circulating medium except gold and silver''', and to give to the United States the exclusive control over the coining and valuing of the metallic medium. That the real dollar may represent property, and not the shadow of it.

From the dissenting opinion to one of the Legal Tender cases http://supreme.justia.com/us/79/457/case.html - starts with THE CHIEF JUSTICE, dissenting'Acts of Congress not made in pursuance of the Constitution are not laws.We perceive no connection between the express power to coin money and the inference that the government may, in any contingency, make its securities perform the functions of coined money, as a legal tender in payment of debtsIt is unnecessary to say that we reject wholly the doctrine, advanced for the first time",0

Hi Fayenatic london,

I take your point about not publishing denials )

I wasn't aware that the misnomer category is likely to disappear. (As a side issue, is it required for a page to have at least one category? I have been editing for only a few months, and I'm still learning.)

Regarding other drums from different countries/languages, it doesn't make sense to rule in the name of a drum from a different language because dunun are Malinke drums. There is a Nigerian drum called ju ju but that drum is completely different (frame drum).
I have also found references to a drum called """"dun dun"""" or """"djun djun"""" from Nigeria, but as an hourglass-shaped drum, similar to the Malinke tama. (Again, that's a completely different instrument.) The notability of these sources is doubtful in any case; they are about as credible as shops that sell djembe and dunun…

As an analogy (somewhat strained), the didgeridoo is often referred to by Australians as a """"didge"""". Despite this, that doesn't make """"didge"""" a legitimate name for the instrument. It does not have this name in any aboriginal language. Similarly, you will find many places on the web saying that """"djembe"""" is pronounced """"DJEM-bay"""". It is not pronounced that way by the Malinke (who named the drum and pronounce it """"DJEM-be""""). It is only in western English-speaking countries that the incorrect pronunciation is occasionally used.

I had a look at the links you found. There are hundreds more like them, and these are not notable sources. For one, the dunun (and djembe) did not originate in Ghana. (The history of the dunun and djembe in Ghana is no longer than the history in the West because it was not until after colonialism ended that these drums found their way to Ghana. Up to that point, djembe and dunun were confined to the traditional Malinke area (Mali, Guinea, and parts of Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Ivory Coast).) Yes, I know that there are many sources claiming that the djembe and dunun came from Ghana (or Benin), but those claims are simply incorrect, and there is plenty of literature from reputable source to show this.

As to Mamady Keita being a reputable source, that is something beyond dispute: he is one of the most respected and famous masters world-wide, Malinke, and grew up in a traditional village.

What has happened here is that a lot of people who don't have the cultural background have copied from each other. This is unfortunate, but continued mis-use of a term doesn't make it correct, unless the use has entered the vernacular to such a point that it becomes valid. (Djun djun is nowhere near that common use.)

When I first learned about the """"djun djun"""" issue, I made it a point to pay attention to this. I have spent extensive time (many months) in West Africa studying with a number of masters there, including in Ghana and Mali. Not once have I heard native speakers there (either Ghana or Mali) refer to the drum as """"djun djun"""". I also have already asked old and young master drummers specifically about this. Famoudou Konate, Mohamed Bangoura, Epizo Bangoura, Lansana Camara, Isaac """"Tuza"""" Afutu, and Aliou Sylla (all teachers of mine) have all told me that no such word exists.

I believe it is beyond any doubt that """"djun djun"""" is a misnomer. The only question is what do with the djun djun page. A redirect to dunun is incorrect IMO because it would implicitly legitimize the incorrect term as a synonym. So, I would still like to retain the page but I don't know what I would have to do to bring the page up to acceptable standard. Can you help me here? A big problem when writing about Malinke instruments and drumming culture is that there is little material in writing. Most of the information is passed verbally from master to student. And, as far as I know, I cannot simply create a citation saying something like """"Famoudou Konate, June 2011, personal communication""""?   """,0

 Merging Dark matter in fiction 

The concept is not something that requires an entire article. It should be placed here and kept down to two or three paragraphs. The lists are pointless and do not need to be kept, though a few important examples can be taken to be used in the paragraphs.   
 Oppose per recent AfD.   
How does using a """"no consensus"""" AfD to oppose something make any sense? If you believe that the information cannot fit here, please just state that instead.   
There was no consensus for deletion, which is what the merge would effectively be - or are you suggesting that anything actually be added to the article beyond the paragraph that is already there?   \
I'm thinking the beggining paragraphs and a decent number of examples for now. Either way, the current article would have to end up in that shape anyway.   
 If it's going to be here, will this article's editors actually permit it? I get the feeling that article was created as a spinout of this one.   
Generally, they are only created because people keep piling on every single trivial reference to the topic they can find. They aren't usually split if they are actually kept down to a decent size.   
Right, but there's a tangibly greater resistance to WP:IPC sections in hard science topics than there are in general arts/literature articles.  I've already gone through and pared the list down during the AfD, and flagged about half of the rest as unreferenced.  If only the referenced sections were kept, that would still be substantially larger than the target size you advocate. In my mind, another AfD in a month or two would be a more straightforward way to handle it: either the list meets notability guidelines or it doesn't, but calling it a """"merge"""" and deleting 90+% of the content is not the right way to get rid of the article.   
The problem with going back to AfD is that the system is completely hit or miss. If you get the right people, it is certainly possible to get this deleted on the second go, but at the same time, it is also possible that this could get to the fifth nomination without anything more the five """"no consensus"""" results. Merging in the few decent references and a few of the examples is much better, as it allows for more control.   
Eh, I guess I'd rather see the entries that currently fail WP:V sourced or removed and the list kept as a separate article, so I guess that means I Oppose this merger as stated.   
The separate lists will have to be removed eventually, so there is really no benefit in keeping it. Even if you were to add references to every one of the current pieces of trivia, they would still be take up undue weight, and it would have to shift into paragraph format eventually. The proper way is to cite one or two for each different kind of media, and in a properly sourced article, they could probably be used to identify things like the first real use of Dark Matter in fiction and the like.   
 That eventuality isn't obvious to me from my reading of WP:SAL and WP:IPC.   
We do not have any featured lists that follow this kind of format (unless you can point any out), so that is one definite sign that these are doomed to either sit forever, be deleted, or actually be used to fill in the parent topic. Despite the fact that these are never sourced, it would actually be quite easy to do so if someone felt like it, and such a list would probably still be flat-out rejected for being trivial.   
Oppose merge.  Good list that could be improved.  Best, My talk 
Oppose. Almost all the examples in the 'Dark matter in fiction' article are very different to dark matter in astronomy. They are better as separate articles. Putting the fiction stuff here would distract attention away from the science and discourage ex",0

It's something I've been meaning to go looking for (the articles where they've talked about how they are similar and different from the originals) but haven't had a chance to do yet.  This sort of thing is always an issue on list of character articles -  they tend to get updated with plot summary and very little else.  But as the show progresses there will be more material to drop in so that the article isn't so in-universe and has more real world info.

But would you still remove my edits if I added that information to the casting section?

If we can find the links to back up the comparisons, absolutely not.  I think it will be great info to provide once we have our sources.  It's exactly the kind of thhing I mean by real world info (casting the roles, how they are changed from originals by creators, how actors interpret the scenes and characters).  

Actually what I gave in my first reply wasn't plot summaries, but character summaries. 

That was actually a reference to an edit that came after yours.  Someone added waaay too much plot detail in there and I was reverting past two people's edits.  Since the lines for our edit summaries are so short, I find it hard to be clear about that sometimes.  

And while unsourced original research, it was from my experience of watching every season and  episode of the UK show so far and doing the same pretty much with the American one. I hate things like this where it's true but you have a hard time finding something that confirms it's true due to Wikipedia's standards. 

I know exactly what you mean.  It drives me bonkers sometimes.  I like to drove myself nuts last year looking for this little bit I remembered from an interview about an actor on True Blood.  But it really does prevent more problems than it causes.  Imagine if every person who had an off the wall interpretation of a scene came in and said """"well this bit reminded me of this thing in another thing so clearly the other thing was an inspiration.""""  

No need to make this personal. But if I really did come across that way I'm sorry, because I didn't mean to.

Not personal at all; no worries.  I just figured you undid before you saw  my reply to you here.  My edit summary probably seemed more blunt than I meant it because, again, trying to explain the reversion of more than one edit.  And I do waaay too much recent changes patrolling which seems to lead to a severe truncating of verbage in edit summaries.  I probably seem like a stark raving butthead half the time when I'm just trying to be brief.  I think you have great instincts about the type of stuff we'll want to include on the article.  We just have to find the articles to back up the info.  There's not going to be a lot out there yet because it's the first season but it'll be awesome if we can start getting the article overhauled with this kind of stuff right away.  I follow the UK version's article and a few other list of character articles that have been going on for years with just updates to plot summary and no real world stuff.  So now it's particularly overwhelming a thought to try and fix them.  The True Blood characters page is my personal nightmare.  I'll get around to it?

One thing I've been looking for is an article I read just before the premiere that talked about changes made to the three main characters.  I vaguely recall that it had some quotes from the writers and a couple of the actors (I think Witwer mentioned something about watching the UK version).  I can't seem to dig up the link from the message boards where I read about the show though.  Ack.""",0

 Demonising Turks 
It is obvious from certain Wikipedia articles that many people are using it as a vehicle to demonise Turks. Wherever possible articles derogatory to these people are being written, media and writings manipulated so that when a search is done of Google - only one version - a completely Christo-Armenia, Greek Othodox version can be found. It is seems that as in America, Armenian and Greek lobbying is alive and well here, too. What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too. It seems that all that it needs to get the Jew and the gentile on the same wagon, is to beat the tired old donkey issue of the barbarious Turk. 

It wears thin. 

To be honest, I don't want Turkey to join the EU. I want you and teh editors and admin that are like-minded to carry on with your actions. We need to perpetuate the misnomers and misrepresentation of the Turks. Forget the Royal Academy's exhibition last year about these people. We need to keep isolating them. Because one day you will help in ending your civilisation by cutting such a large chunk of it out. 

I do hope you get what you deserve.  14:30, 15 April 2006",0

"Originally born in OHIO,and raised on a yuppie farmh in a small town outside of dayton, ohio. Her mother is a professional and has worked for the government for almost 30 years and her father is retired.   Traci was raised on staage at the age of 2 starting with ballet then tap, then jazz.... she was a natural on stage..... throughout her childhood she was in pagaents and sport like softball, volleyball and track in high school, she competed in many events: Miss Wright State of OHIO,All American Drill Team.

After Traci graduated, her love of dance and people took her to a business college, where she studied basics in business management.  Then she learned ins and outs of banking and later took on another degree in Medical Techology. She also did promotional work for , bartended , ran local bars and competed in bikini contests for extra funds.

In 1996, Traci started lifting weights with a friend and saw a photo of Marla Duncan winning a national competition. Her beauty and physique impressed her enough that she wanted to try what she was doing - Fitness Competitions. At the time she was developing some problems medically and noticed herself gaining some weight.   Traci thought weight training would help but she found that because she is a natural she responded almost imediately to the weights which caused her to get pretty stocky and very strong quick.  She was still eating normally but when it comes to bikini contests you need to be lean and feminine.... well this is when the Army Soldiers took a noticed to her.  She was at Ft. Hood, TX and was left alone because a lot of times soldiers are away for months to years and she was pretty shy meeting others because she had always been very much independent.  So she decided to check out while in studies some competitions related to the Army.  This is where she found out about obstacles course contests... so she knew she was strong and stocky so maybe this would be better for her.  So she entered her first WTF competition with little or know training and out of 100 girls made nationals in top 10. but something happened ... she started noticing her weight wasn't changing and she was developing back problems and fatigue.   She had always had problems with being healthy as a kid and seemed to get sick a lot.  Her Father was always on her about bundling up.  One day her discomfort and taken so much that she ended up in the emergency room... this is when she found that her bowels had backed up into her system and she was lucky because if was really serious... the only time she had ever dealt with hospitals is with her hearing... she had lost her hearing at four along with being sick all the time... and at 17 had to have implants put in which was a miracle cause it gave her 80% back... but she is still considered hearing impaired... now this is happening to her... she had gained a weight up to 180 and looked very stocky... the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her.... she spent three days being detoxed so to speak... when they didn't know if she had lupus, rheumatoid, but later found traces of cancer in her colon... but she didn't let it get her down. So she reenrolled in school again for more college degrees towards nutrition in NC.   Up until 2002 she only competed for fun, not as a money making career. In 2002 she was honored with several titles in many organizations like Hawaiian Tropic, Venus, Ms Fitness and Sport Aerobics and WTF.. it wasn't til she had heard she was on ESPN2 every month for one year and honored on the front page of her local newspaper and found herself in several articles in OXYGEN. This helped Traci realize that she had potential to earn some actual money in the fitness industry. She kept competing and in April of '2002 moved to an organization which she had heard was tough and very different from others called NPC /IFBB.  This is where Arnold S. Slyvester Stalone and many more came out of you know the BOYS CLUB Once she arrived, competing in her first NPC she had found a very different way they handled threi shows and treated the competitors... Shoop coming from a strong female in charge background family life saw that this was going to be a challenge for her... she had dreamed of maybe getting more exposure and getting the chance to really be friends with some of the hollywood celebrities.  During the time she was studying nutriiton she always had more than several ideas and projects in mind to bring to the future.... now she has alwsy felt competing natural was always her best route and found with no help and little support she was able to conquer her enemies and achieve her goals.  She was always wnadering why thes other girls who seemed to get covers and major sponsors did it... where she found herself funding everything on her little $7 an hour because she as a military spouse never made as much in those cities because the husband was the provider she was tired of the little she wanted bigger she knew that s",0

 What a mess I've made 
Sigh... this was all entirely my fault. My only """"defence"""" is that it's been over half a year since I was last blocked and I slipped up - yeah, it's not much of one at all (hence the quotation marks).

User:Guy Macon, I should have stopped with the template warnings immediately after you made it clear that you did not appreciate the first one (which was indeed issued in good faith, even if it did not seem like it to you - but I suppose that doesn't really matter much at this point). Issuing another warning for an edit you made to your own talk page was particularly ridiculous on my part.

User:Thomas.W, I should have heeded your warnings instead of mentioning possible retaliation. Not much more I can say about that.

User:DangerousPanda, I shouldn't have written the comment above (which I've now struck out). Your well-timed block likely saved me from a formal report (and a possible community ban, given my sanction history).

Please let me know what you all think of this (particularly since I'd like to be sure we're now on the same page before filing a formal unblock request). Thank you.   """,0

I think the article has been used to include every quote of somebody making that analogy or denying it.

But the article on the actual analogy should be based on sources discussing the analogy, not ones using it. You do that you cut out half of the article.

"Thanks a lot. Before I thought wiki stores only diff's between versions. As we can think that the most simple compression method is saving the diff sections For example, in order to save 
{1000, 1003, 1005, 1021, 1240, 1241} we only needed to save {1000, 3+, 2+, 16+, 1240, 1+}, and
this is indentical to the basic of image compression like jpeg, or motion compression like mpeg.
In order to save motion pictures, mpeg used I frame, P frame, P frame, ..., I frame, P frame, ....,
so I was suprised to hear that wiki saves all the verion in full text format. Anyway thanks. 
It would be great to have a page something like wikipedia:wikipage storage format that explains
in detail how the wikipedia saves its every pages of every version in detail and how the editing warrings (edit battle?) effects on the storage usage and how a single character addition effects on the storage usage, etc. If you had some authority on wiki and knew the stroge mechanism of wiki, how about to edit that page?

This have trusted sources???: (confirmed by a few people who buyed a PSP-3000 Special Edition (Harry Potter Version)?? OH YES SONY CONFIRMED THAT!!! OR WHAT?? [and even world bought is written wrong]  
Actually a new PSPs have a version 5.70 or higher. Even in Wikipedia is written: [5.70]This firmware is only available pre-installed on new PSP-N1000 (PSPgo) models and cannot be downloaded. SO ARE YOU BLIND OR WHAT???!!! AND HOW CAN BE THIS POSTED IF IT DOESN'T HAVE SOURCE?

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

"""== Purges in the Red Army ==

The late 1930s saw the so-called """"Purges of the Red Army cadres"""", occurring against the historical background of the Great Purge. The Purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of the """"politically unreliable element"""", mainly among the higher-ranking officers. This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for settling personal vendettas and eventually resulted in a witch hunt. Some observers believe that the Purges weakened the Red Army considerably, but this remains a hotly debated subject. Many commentators overlook the fact that the Red Army grew significantly in numbers during the peak of the Purges. In 1937, the Red Army numbered around 1.3 million, and it grew to almost three times that number by June 1941. This necessitated quick promotion of junior officers, often despite their lack of experience or training, with obvious grave implications. In another important consideration, by the end of the Purges the pendulum swung back, restoring and promoting many of the purged officers.

Recently declassified data indicate that in 1937, during the culmination of the Purges, the Red Army had 114,300 officers, of whom 11,034 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940. Yet, in 1938, the Red Army had 179,000 officers (56% more compared to 1937), of whom a further 6,742 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940

In the highest echelons of the Red Army the Purges removed 3 of 5 marshals, 13 of 15 army generals, 8 of 9 admirals, 50 of 57 army corps generals, 154 out of 186 division generals, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.

"===Belated Merry Christmas and Hello from N.Srinivasan: a few submissions on contradictions in Indian History pages: Thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages:=

Dear Tiptoety,

I request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by User Dinesh Kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources, is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.

This communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of Wikipedia and nothing else. 

It has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of Wikipedia pages, whatever we do users like Dinesh Kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from POV websites etc.  

Just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the Chalukya Empires especially with reference to the Chola Empire (pls. also remember that in Wikipedia for God knows what reason, the pages on the Chola Empire have been christened as Chola Dynasty despite that the fact that the Cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in India but also overseas including Sri Lanka, Maldives, very large parts of South East Asia for at least 150 years of their existence.  Here are the examples: but before that I would like to say this that deliberately, user Dinesh Kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the Chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the Chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the Chola empire (saying that the Chola territories were taken over by the Pandiyas), which has a great weakness:  

the Chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from 1126 onwards and between 1135/1140 to 1175 their kings were displaced and the Kalachuris under Bijjala I and Bijjala II ruled Kannada country in India.  The Chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just 10-15 years between 1185 to 1198 after which they went into oblivion.  I request  that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the Cholas, whose kings from AD 1170 though were not as strong as their kings between AD 848-1165, yet one of their last great kings Kulothunga III on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied Madurai, Karur and Sri Lanka (then known as Ilangai) between 1185-1200 AD.  He ruled for around 45 years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the Pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty, having Hoysalas as his allies.  Yet, even with weak kings following him after 1218, the Cholas lasted till 1279, when their last king lost to the Pandiyas and the Cholas went into oblivion.  

Contrast the above i.e. the demise of the Cholas in 1279 or 1280 to that of the Chalukyas, who were first of all without a capital for over 35 years and re-emerged for just 10-15 years and became history by AD 1195 or thereabouts.  Yet, jingoism seems to get the better of user Dinesh Kannambadi and he has written in the Western Chalukya Empire page as under:  the link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukyas and the relevant portion of text is the following:

“This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.”
Though (technically speaking at least) as per the version of Dinesh Kannambadi, the Chalukyas fell and demised in 1191/1195 and the Cholas demised after almost 9 decades in about 1279/80…. i.e. within a hundred years of each other… I would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression …”This period saw the fall of two great empires…”  I mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other, then the expression could be a little contemporaneous… but even as a weak empire the Cholas lasted till 1280 almost 84 years after the Chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the Cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the Chalukya dynasty, which went into oblivion in the year 1191 or 1195???? 

The point is that whether it is mentioning the Hoysalas another Kannada empire or the Chalukyas, he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the Cholas.. even while mentioning Chalukya architecture, user Dinesh Kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the Cholas;;; see this write u",0

BARBARO

I left some comments on F550's talk page. I think how Wikipedia has treated this F550 and the Barbaro family was unfair. I also noticed that this individual seems to have just tried to edit his name out of those two bogus societies, which seems fair to me, and Wikipedia editors keeps bringing it back. It seems like Wikipedia's disregard for others is very cruel. just my thoughts 

I also left some comments too on genio or ganios talk page too 

 Excuse me Gustav, your contribution with adding San Francesco della Vigna was actually not correct. I left a comment for you on Giano's talk page. I think everyone is desperately trying to piece inconsequential tid-bit in hope that something resembling an article might show up. The original version I saw a month ago was just fine and accurate.

Gustav, I just had a chance to look at the history of the Barbaro family page. Why was the article listed as the """"TRUE BARBARO FAMILY ARTICILE..."""" removed. That is the one that should be the official Barbaro family page. It has excellent Zorzi sources and clearly is structured in a not only a factual way, but also a way that captures the true spirit and soul of the family. This aricle that you have replaced it with is crummy.

Why isn't this page flagged """"under construction"""". You gotta be kidding me if this is the official article that is constructed for the great Barbaro family. Please say it isn't so. This has got to be the worst article I have ever seen on Wikipedia. This thing stinks! Usually articles this dinky are flagged as stubs asking for people to expand on them. I think it is time to admit Gustav that you are out of your league. Clearly the person that constructed the former Barbaro family article was an Art Historian that new this family and proper sources well. 

 
 HYPER-INDIVIDUALIST@YAHOO.COM IS IN ON THE HOAX!  

This hyper guy is in on it with Tiki-two. They planned to damage the Barbaro family page all long. First they started bogus societies which they knew would lead to the family page being destroyed. They planned it well. Tiki used the same company computer which would discredit the family's input and this hyper guy stayed out from editing so he would seem clean. But how come the conversation on the secret society talk page is only between Tiki and Hyper. Even his tag looks suspicious, """"Hyper-individualist"""". Watch this guy very closely. I think the Barbaro family needs an I'm sorry. Because I noticed that whenever it seems like the Barbaro page was going to be restored, than all of a sudden Hyper jumped in with Hoax Hoax! Very sneaky and well timed Hyper. I see what is going on. How can anyone discredit all of the evidence that was given in supportfor the family. I get you Hyper. You were the straight man and Tiki played the opposite role, but you are both as guilty-without any doubt!

"I disagree. The fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance; the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, that allows for both coalitions and majority rule. That hasn't changed, and so to say that because we currently have a coalition, of whatever party, means that the position of Deputy Prime Minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false. I am all for mentioning Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister in the article, around the same place David Cameron is currently described as Prime Minister, but to put Clegg alongside the Queen and Prime Minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. Now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the Prime Minister's second-in-command, and if Cameron were to die/resign suddenly Clegg would become Prime Minister, I would completely agree that he should be there, but it isn't. Clegg may be Deputy Prime Minister, but he is not deputy head of government, and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government.",0

I agree. The entire section titled """"Bridging the Second and Third Reichs in German South West Africa"""" looks like WP:OR.

Descriptions such as """"Heinrich """"worked"""" in German Southwest Africa, and Hermann was a """"well known member"""" of the NSDAP""""; this guy """"originated the slogan Lebensraum while in GSWA in 1910, a sympathizer who influenced the NSDAP since 1923""""; or even """"member NSDAP in 1933, founder of German East Africa"""" (this article is not about German East Africa). Enumerating every single person who visited GSWA and later had some role in WWII does not seem especially remarkable or particularly informative and the entire section could be reduced to a paragraph or two summarizing the arguments for the link that some authors have provided.

Do you mean you can read about those work conditions & not see that it's slavery?  Prepare yourself for earthshaking news: the wage system is slavery but most people didn't think so.  Slavery means """"someone who is controlled by someone or something.""""   A boss controls a slave, but a slave also enslaves a boss.   Being offered a wage you can't live on is slavery.   All jobs are being eliminated by machine-slaves,  which makes it more obvious than ever before that all people must have a Guaranteed Minimum Income, although I prefer the word 'residual' to 'minimum'.  Read child labour & try to see it was child slavery into the 20th century, & it still is today since many children work in their parents' business.  When they """"ended child labour"""" that didn't set the children free; they were """"free to starve"""" because what they need/ed is a GMI.  Having children is a form of slavery too: parents become slaves to their children (when they need to eat, bathe, etc) but the children are also slaves to their parents.  So """"no control"""" also means we'll always be slaves to needing food, & we can find ways to eliminate all the work with machines which again means all people need a GMI.  (Actually all people should own all things, because when a few rich people own everything it's obviously slavery; how did every person not know that?  America refused to let any attempts at Socialism & Communism succeed; instead they forced it to fail by starting many wars, teaching torture, & you must read Wm Blum's """"Rogue State"""".  Fidel Castro was right & America was wrong.)  And the BLS is wrong; they always underestimate, because most of those people are probably illegal immigrants from many generations back.  They say every year 50,000 people are smuggled into the US to work as prostitutes (that's slavery), so can you imagine how many illegals there must be in America hidden behind walls, & all supporting a few rich slave masters who travel the world & raise their families on the backs of SLAVES in America.  How can you read about multinational corporations & not see they cause poverty in those other countries, as well as in America?    If Liberia has a population of 3 million & one corporation goes there & """"creates only 2000 jobs"""" then can't anyone see the wage is causing their poverty??  That's just an example, but do you see what I'm saying about the wage is the problem worldwide, not the solution, like America thinks?  When 3,000 people show up to apply for 20 job openings, you know the wage is wrong & it's slavery.  I know I'm a slave, & I know every person is a slave & I'm right & everyone is wrong.

"Wizzy - you are the problem of your own creation. 

Ohhhh Wizzy, 

See the problem is that while pushing people around and being nasty to them, might make you feel ever so important, what really happens is that all you do is make more people not like you.

It's called the cycle of abuse and neglect; You abuse other people and they neglect you, so to make youself feel all important; your now trying to make them pay attention to you by being even more nasty to them and others; and again - they and even more people want to have nothing to do with you.

There really are no bonus points to be had in being a bully who is nasty to everyone; but again you are responsible for making yourself into that kind of a person; so therefore it's a personal problem that is up to you to resolve by taking responsibility for the fact that you are choosing to be nasty to other people.

As to what you do about your problem - which is you and your attitude towards others and how you treat them; is really nothing to do with me.

So anyway, I am off to have a great day.

Cheers

"Welcome!

Welcome to Wikipedia, !  My name is Ryan, aka . I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use HTML and CSS. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:

How to edit a page
Editing, policy, conduct, and structure tutorial
Picture tutorial
How to write a great article

There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my talk page. Please be sure to sign your name on Talk using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right? )

I hope you enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. We can use all the help we can get! Have a nice day.

The more the better. The Scientific Statement of Being AND the tenets.... There is no conflict here Alexbrn. There is room for both ideas.  Are there some religious/philosophical beliefs you should declare to us as to why it is difficult for you to be neutral here?The Christian Science tenets are tucked nicely in a reference where they will not take up any room.

Why not have both?  There is room. The Scientific Statement of Being is present. There is no conflict in having both.  There are 8 very sound sources that say the Tenets are the core beliefs.

Tenets of Christian Science
* 1. As adherents of Truth, we take the inspired Word of the Bible as our sufficient guide to eternal Life.
 2. We acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God. We acknowledge His Son, one Christ; the Holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man in God's image and likeness.
 3. We acknowledge God's forgiveness of sin in the destruction of sin and the spiritual understanding that casts out evil as unreal. But the belief in sin is punished so long as the belief lasts.
 4. We acknowledge Jesus' atonement as the evi‐ dence of divine, efficacious Love, unfolding man's unity with God through Christ Jesus the Way-shower; and we acknowledge that man is saved through Christ, through Truth, Life, and Love as demonstrated by the Galilean Prophet in healing the sick and overcoming sin and death.
 5. We acknowledge that the crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection served to uplift faith to under‐ stand eternal Life, even the allness of Soul, Spirit, and the nothingness of matter.
 6. And we solemnly promise to watch, and pray for that Mind to be in us which was also in Christ Jesus; to do unto others as we would have them do unto us. And to be merciful, just and pure.",0

 Peak Ground Acceleration of Tohoku Earthquake?

 Three Theories of Planet Formation Busted

I have reversed your 89 uses of the shy template at Jean Berko Gleason, and thought I should explain why.Unfortunately, the Wikipedia search treats all the part-words, each side of the shy template, as separate words, so they appear as a vast number of mis-spellings,  Although useful for very long words, such as the example at Template:Shy, it should be used sparingly - the third word of a line, is highly unlikely to need splitting as a line-end word, whilst breaking words across two lines makes them much harder to read.

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Klseason11cap.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. Thank you.  (T/C)

For very well-known celebrities, the US government archives may have something: a Google image search on """"site:.gov"""" may bring something up.  Also, the search engine on the Archives website (http://www.archives.gov/) may find things that Google doesn't.  For people with military service, the military might have something (Google search on """"site:.mil"""").

For celebrities that were well-known before 1950, there may be newspaper photographs that have fallen out of copyright.  These will be hard to find, but the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/) may have something.

A further option is to contact the celebrity's agent or estate and ask for an image to be released under GFDL, Creative Commons attribution, or Creative Commons sharealike-attribution licenses.

In my opinion, if free-use images can't be found, the second-best choice is a promotional photo: it's an image that is intended to be distributed widely.  Of course, there are exceptions: for albums, singles, and DVDs, a low-resolution scan of the cover is always appropriate.  For movies, a still from a well-known scene or a low-resolution scan of a promotional poster is good.  Failing all else, other fair-use images can be used, but they need to be tagged, justified, have the source/copyright owner credited, and used very sparingly.

As for the images at Iron Maiden, I'm still trying to figure out how strict I should be about fair-use images: all the images there are directly related to the subject of the article (except Image:PrisonerNovel.jpg, which I've just removed), all of them have some semblance of a source indicated, all of them have some semblance of a fair-use justification, and none of them seem to be surplus to the needs of the article.

Is there not some mechanism by which she can be instructed to direct her attention away from my activities and let the other 800 Wikipedia admins perform the job of protecting Wikipeida from Andrew William Morrow?  If the problem is truly Andrew William Morrow, then it will be obvious to the other admins, but in fact, that has not been the case.  Oh sure, there has been the occasional problem (if you look at my Wikipedia work as indexed on my web site, you will see that I choose to focus on controversial biographies with a high content of U.S. case law).  This Irish woman has nothing to offer the articles she has personally targeted via this tool Template:Pinktulip except to hit the undo button. She has done no research.  She has conducted no dialog with other editors.  Like you, she always claims to be """"too busy"""" to engage in any actual dialog, but she has plenty of time to sit around and chat with her Catholic pro-life friends and hit the undo button every time she sees non-vandalism contributions that she simply does not like.  As you can see by her user page, she is highly prone to view the work of others through the rather narrow prism of her Pope's worldview.  If you study Special:Contributions/Musical Linguist you will see that she spends many, many hours on Wikiepdia every day and note the quick response time of her reverts: She must be monitoring her watch list vigorously.  Is this really what you want Wikipedia to be about?  Letting admins, no matter how polite, intelligent and pretty impose their worldview on others?  Is it such a tragedy to put some horse-blinders on her to say: """"For these specific users and these specific articles, you will stay away.  You have had much more than your fair turn at these specific users and these specific articles and now you, dear and valued admin, are being administratively rotated out of them and you will stay rotated out of them for a good, long time.""""  Is that such a tragedy?  Fred: It is only a tragedy if the problem is really within the admin herself, rather than within the targeted or banned user(s).  The mature admin would not take such instructions as an insult, but simply as a matter of due course.  Musical Linguist is much like the childless woman hovering over someone else's child, ever-ready to snatch the child and claim it for her own.  It is a natural impulse, but it requies intervention because it is also a disorderly impulse.  All I have done is to flush the woman out by getting her to fill out the """"Pinktulip"""" template completely.  Her contribution to the information content the articles listed in the Pinktulip template is zero, but but she now exerts total control of them.  She is merely a sterile, charming, controlling woman and she should herself now be controlled.  She is all process and no results.  That is not what Wikipeida was supposed to be about.

 Swastika as a mnemonic device http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html 

The article needs more information about the swastika's use as a modern mnemonic device. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Rex Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by the National Socialist German workers Party as alphabetic symbolism, including meshed """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism."""" The leader of German National Socialists at that time altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  Professor Curry showed that many modern myths use a false belief that Nazis called themselves """"Nazis.""""  The myths cause widespread ignorance of the eytmology of the word """"Nazi."""" Party members called themselves """"National Socialists,"""" not """"Nazis.""""  Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas use the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not call their symbol a """"swastika.""""  Another person conceded the point with the comment that """"It does seem to be the case that the National Socialist German Workers' Party originated the 45° orientation...."""" though they did not necessarily originate that use, the German National Socialists did independently alter their use of the symbol for their specific desire to highlight the """"S"""" letter for """"socialism."""" Of course, the additional comment that they didn't use the 45 degree orientation consistently also concedes Professor Curry's work showing that their leader deliberately altered / evolved the symbol from its historic orientation into meshed """"S"""" letters for socialism. The graphic resonance is highly suggestive... and in fact it is compelling! In fact, one of the flags that Dr. Curry cites argues for that thesis: The swastika itself comprises two S's, and that is shown to have been known consciously when the German National Socialists overlay two additional S's for another group (as German National Socialists had other examples of similar alphabetic symbolism). Hitler even altered his own signature to reflect the same """"S"""" for socialism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html The leader of the German Socialists had no reason to harp on this idea because he was an ex-artist. Nevertheless, he did allude to the alphabetic symbolism in his own comments in his notorious book. Of course, he would not drone on about it just as he did not drone on about what the stylized """"SA"""" symbol meant, or the side-by-side """"SS"""" symbol, or the """"VW"""" (all of which other writers concede for some inconsistent reason). The only reason it is so hard for most people to understand today is because they have been trained to use the hackneyed shorthand for the Party and most people are ignorant of the name of the actual Party, and thus have no idea that the Party actually espoused a dogma that they called """"Socialism."""" Even to this day, people repeatedly delete Dr. Curry's work in an effort to perpetuate the ignorance and the myths.""",0

 Midway = turning point 

In my view, if there WAS a turning point in the war on Japan, Midway has to be it. While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being """"merely"""" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. 

Now, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can't be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack.

I don't think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately 'won' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: 

1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor)
2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war.
3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN.
4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. 
5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses.

But they failed at (1) when they didn't sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling.

So, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway.

"'Five Moves of Doom' 

As a fan of John Cena, I am against the hypocrisy of many of his critics for their 'Five Moves Of Doom' comments, especially since many of these people support Hogan, Boogeyman, and Batista, all of whom have not the same in-ring skill as Cena. However, it is absolutely absurd that the Five Moves are repeatedly removed by some mark-out fanboy who doesn't want anything negative said about Cena. The Five Moves are the basis of almost all criticism aimed at Cena, and therefore I have placed them back on the page, although obviously I have rephrased the wording so it is no longer biased against Cena and is entirely factual. Don't remove them again, as that is just stupid and goes against your whole 'no bias' attitude since you're biasing it in favour of Cena while also not letting people know the truth. Again, this is from a HUGE defender of Cena's skill.",0

"""After this case, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) attempted a nationwide assessment of child grooming.  The report found that police, social services and charities were failing to properly investigate this """"hidden issue"""" and that a quarter of offenders reported for child grooming since 2008 were Asian, an apparently disproportionate figure, but Peter Davies, the head of Ceop, was quick to clarify that the findings did not provide a national picture because of incomplete data, and cautioned against extrapolating anything from the results. He added that """"looking at this issue through the lens of ethnicity does not do the victims any favours.""""

Again - I'm not sure that this section needs to exist. Also from the outset it is misleading. CEOP constantly monitor for and act upon child grooming  - they didn't suddenly decide to start after this case. 

CEOP has existed since April 2006 and there has been a phased introduction of their work in conjuration with partners ever since - starting it's main recognised operations in 2009, by which time the police were acting.

"""4. This last summary is partly from chapters two, three, and four in Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W. (1997). Children communicating: the first 5 years. Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. 
The main idea for chapter two, Nonverbal communication: its origins and development, is the awareness of events around the child such as gaze and gesture interaction, facial expressions, and modifying emotional expressiveness. """"With age, children's encoding (sending messages) and decoding (interpreting messages) skills increase. Yet children are better at decoding than at encoding, a fact suggesting that nonverbal comprehension precedes production"""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 35). This fact represents interpersonal communication and how it improves with age in children. 
The main point for chapter three, The development of language, is the social development based on the environment of the child. """"Children's nonverbal communication skills, especially those developed through interactional synchrony with adult caretakers, foreshadow the conversational exchanges that typify interpersonal communication."""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 57) Good interpersonal communication starts from the beginning with infant communication, mainly nonverbal, and so it translates to the developmental skills to attain high levels of communication. This chapter also touches on stages in language development which is a slight alternative idea to explain parts of interpersonal developmental process. The stages include prelinguistic development, speech perception/production, semantic development, private speech, and first words. 
Also, the main idea for chapter four, Developing verbal communication and how its relevant in children's acquisition of a variety of communicative strategies for attaining goals. A main focus is """"discussing the communicative intentionally substage of development"""" for infants """"emerging abilities to control their communicative skills"""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 105). All three chapters contribute to a more concise understanding of language how it contributes to the ideas of interpersonal communication development in young children.

""""The bamboo flute first came to Japan from China via Korea. The shakuhachi proper, however, is quite distinct from its Chinese and Korean ancestors, the result of centuries of isolated evolution in Japan.

From WP:AN

Request some independent assistance

Request some independent assistance

Could another admin have a serious word in the ear of StuRat (talk • contribs). He is a consistently disruptive editor who regularly accuses admins of abuse and cabalism. This evening alone he has been:

Accusing an admin of """"an abuse of Admin authority"""" in protecting a page being targeted by a persistent banned user (whom, incidently, StuRat was an erstwhile colleague of and still occasionally adds content on his behalf). 

Goading an editor who indicated they are leaving the project (after a run in with a new editor with a suspiciously detailed knowledge of the project) 

Replacing the goading comment after three independent editors expressed disaproval (the aforementioned new user gets in on the act too). 

I have already warned him, but he ignored me, and I am a bit too close to take any action without stoking the claims of abuse. Thanks. Rockpocket 

1) Note that RP did not request a block, is it normal to take a request to talk with an editor and ignore that and issue a block instead ?  

2) I do believe that it is inappropriate for an Admin involved in an edit war on a page to protect that page when it has the version they support, and believe the talk page for that page, in this case Wikipedia_talk:Reference_desk/guidelines, was the appropriate place to bring up that concern.  

3) As I stated on RP's talk page, I was not """"goading"""" an editor who said they were leaving Wikipedia, but merely stated that I believed they would be back, and why I thought so.  I did object to the removal of that statement from User:Clio the Muse's talk page, by anyone other than Clio.  However, once Clio removed the statement herself, I respected that, and had already told RP that I would respect that.  Somebody else then put it back in (possibly a banned user) and I suspect that RP mistakenly thought it was me putting it back in, due to this edit comment: . 

Does this have anything to do with User:Light current? —Kyриx  

How did you guess? Rockpocket  

The names are familiar, and I commented in Friday's admin recall mess. —Kyриx  

Y'all are a pretty useless lot. Maybe try supporting deserving editors instead of coddling the disruptive ones.—eric 

Eric, I have discussed the matter with Clio privately, and I don't really think my actions today could be described as coddling. Rockpocket  

Hm, the user has a history of incivility and a talk page full of warnings. Looking through his recent edit history reveals many incivil remarks or attacks [101] [102], as well as complaints of abuse [103] and vague threats [104]. I think this is well beyond what we usually tolerate with respect to wikiquette, and have blocked him for 12 hours. >Radiant<

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

Don't patronize me and say that you appreciate the attention I'm giving to the page because if you did you wouldn't have reverted all my edits. The changes I made were not subjective. African dance is not jazz. How the show presents dance versus this page being a primer on dance is a non sequiter. African dance comes from AFRICA, not from jazz dance. How in the world is that subjective? This is obvious. You changing it back to being from jazz dance is actually what's subjective. Funk is STREET. Do some research. Electric Boogie is not a separate sub-style of Electric Boogaloo. It's more like a nickname for Electric Boogaloo, i.e. Michael/Mike, Jennifer/Jenny. So I don't understand why you would list this as a sub-style/variant of Electric Boogaloo. To be completely honest """"Electric Boogie"""" is actually a song. People do the Electric Slide dance to the song """"Electric Boogie"""". Think about the laymen who are reading this page. Because of your suborness, they're going to walk away thinking it's actually a separate dance style when it's not. Nothing that I've said above is subjective. It's based on facts. How can you to call my changes ill-advised and subjective while at the same time claiming the content you added was implemented """"in such way that WP:OR and needless debates on what divides styles does not occur.""""

You know Orwell said the police messed up the republic in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.  He said police had a policy of arresting fighters in his book, Homage to Catalonia, a fight where he participated.  Likewise, I would say poor administrator decisions affect Wikipedia negatively.

Your entries have made quite a few false accusations and continue to do so.  We do plan to proceed on the matter because there's also a vested interest: a link from Wikipedia, though we also gave it to other 501(c)(3)s that do similar work to be fair, provide a NPOV.  """"Bzzt"""" is probably an ad hominem, and where have I used name calling or made """"derogatory remarks""""?  There's also a pro-British slant to all of this whereas the article began using U.S. English.  So far I don't see what I want about having completely followed the rules as far as I can see, though I'm accused otherwise.  """,0
"""

 true cooperation will likely never happen 

cooperation is asked for but is true cooperation asked for?

I don't have any problem with the NPOV rule.  I just see censorship over and over. Wikipedia is clear:

""""None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views. There is no size limit to Wikipedia. But even on such pages, though a view is spelled out possibly in great detail, we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth."""" 

Now I have wanted to have cooperation and have good faith efforts on both sides.  I have listened to the other side and taken feedback. I made some changes although admittedly not a lot.  

However, Cooperation may never happen.  Why?

Here is why:

1.  Does some person keep changing the theological conservative Christianity  internal link in the Biblical scientific foreknowledge (BSF) article so it goes to the Christian right (Falwell, etc).  Would a person who wants to act in good faith do that? 

2. Would people who act in good faith send harrassing messages (""""fundie"""" etc).  

I think the people calling for cooperation yet saying absolutely nothing publically about the bad behavior of certain  anti-BSF parties are not seeking true cooperation.  What they are asking for is the minority view be trampled despite the Wikipedia policy. 

 kdbuffalo

addendum
The Bible says the heart is deceitfully wicked above all things.  The above devious tactics are not a great surprise.   Now you can pretend that someone is not changing the conservative Christianity link to Christian right.   You can pretend MickWest is not harrassing me with messages to my userpage I said I did not want but that doesn't make it so.  You can choose not to view duncharris's userpage.  That is your choice but don't ask me to endorse it.  I am not going to.  I am not going to exist in LaLa land and pretend MickWest and Duncharris are reasonable.  They have shown they are not and it is likely not going to change.  I can adjust to this and recognize this matter.  I suggest you do the same. 

Now you say BSF is minority.  Does the Bible say the universe had a beginning?  Do scientist increasinng recognize this matter?  Do major medical historians recognize where the Bible was ahead of its time? Yes they do.   Now I cannot help people's ignorance regarding these matters but I am not going to let it decide for me my position.""",0

If the IMF no longer uses the """"in transition"""" group, it must mean that they feel it no longer reflects a significant economic difference.

The countries classified by the IMF as advanced economies are in dark blue, the countries designated by the CIA World Factbook as """"in transition"""" are in light blue (except for Slovenia, which is now classified as advanced), the countries designated as """"least developed"""" by the UN are in red, and the remaining countries are in orange.

Since the """"in transition"""" classification is no no longer used by the IMF and appears not to be useful, I suggest that it should be dropped from the map.

I have prepared a possible replacement map on the left.  It shows all countries classified by the IMF as advanced in blue.

12 active, 8 inactive or slightly active = 60% active

If this is roughly accurate, then the number of active admins is probably around 300 or less. (I don't know how many total editors were active in the last 30 days). While some admins involve themselves in setting policies (which anyone may participate in), others seem to confine themselves to truly janitorial work. For that reason I'm not sure if """"bureaucracy"""" is the best way to describe the corps of admins, or the dangers threatened by their expansion. The more plausible fear, I think, is that too many admins will result in a """"police state"""", with more sped-up deletes, heavy-handed blocks, and POV enforcement. I am certainly opposed to any movement in the direction of stifling unpopular POVs. I'm not sure that the number of admins is the major factor though. Another view, which I don't endorse either, is that having more admins broadens involvement and reduces the relative power of any one admin. I think that the most important issues are probably the rules and procedures, official and unofficial, that admins follow and/or enforce on others, Those powers should stay limited. - 05:26, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

 re: VfD bot assistant 
When you get to the actual closing process, I'm not sure I know what could be safely automated.  So many of the decisions require multiple steps.  But I may not be the right person to ask.  I tend to close only the oldest and therefore the most complex discussions.  I suspect that I see all the exceptions and lose sight of the commonalities among the majority of """"simple"""" decisions.  I'll give it some thought, though.  

Am I correct in assuming that the bot would have to be run for each individual discussion thread?  If so, what parameters would have to be fed in?  How complex would it be to initiate the bot?  Would it be a different bot for """"keep"""" decisions vs """"delete"""" decisions?

The essential steps for a """"keep"""" decision are:
 Close the discussion page ({{subst:vt}} and {{subst:vb}} - I suppose the top subst could be modified to allow for a parameter like {{subst:vt|reason}})
# Remove the VfD header from the page (which ''usually'' follows the naming convention of the VfD discussion page except for second nominations and related nominations discussed together
# Add a boilerplate comment to the article's Talk page with a link to the discussion.  I usually put the nomination date on the Talk page, but the closure date is probably close enough.

If the VfD discussion has the same name as the article, a simple """"keep"""" decision might be automatable with a single parameter.  """"Keep as merge"""", """"transwiki"""", etc. would still require extra steps.

The essential steps for a """"delete"""" decision are:
# Check the article's history to confirm that the deletion decision is in order
# Close the discussion page (as above but the reason is often much more detailed)
# Sometimes, check """"what links here"""" and move or delete all those links
# Delete the page

I'm not sure I see how to automate that process.  There are too many variables.  I'll keep chewing on it, though.  Thanks again.  ~~~~""",0

The Hidari-Mitsudomoe (Fijai-Gumun in Okinawan), or the crest of three comma-shaped figures in a circle has been sometimes introduced as the national flag of Ryukyu Kingdom, but the crest originally was a family crest of Sho royal family, and not the national flag.

The Alleged I-605
Back in 2000, here's what was reported about the possibility of an I-605 being built:
""""Another WSDOT released study in 2000 suggested an I-605 beltway that stretched roughly from Tacoma through the Snoqualmie Valley and then to Everett would pull an estimated 29,000 cars off of Interstate 5. But the state never acted on the idea, instead focusing on other ways to relieve congestion on I-5.  The idea drew such opposition that the King County Council eventually amended the county's comprehensive plan to specifically forbid such a roadway from cutting through the area."""" From: http://www.king5.com/topstories/stories/NW_071504WABi605JK.2ffde016b.html.  In other words, the possibility of I-605 ever being planned, let alone built, died about 8 years ago.

Hi Heah, 

Thanks for your reply.  First, I wrongly assumed that Jossi had started the deletions.  He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting.  I didn't know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward.  I still maintain, however, that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism.  They weren't corroborative edits, that's for sure.  They were, as I said, wholesale, repeated deletions of original text.  You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but, in this case, I can assure you that's not the problem.  Jossi's full aware of the fact that both Geaves' comments and Rawat's own contradictory words (in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival) are proven and accurate.  Here's a link to the Geaves' article:

Footnote 5 is the one where Geaves' relieves Rawat of any knowledge or responsibility for the Millenium hype.

And here's a link to the letter Rawat himself wrote which clearly puts the lie to Geaves' revisionism:

The Wiki rule about vandalism states that most is dealt with by fast reversions.  However, it doesn't say that persistent efforts in this regard may nonetheless violate the three-reversion rule and trigger blocking!  It does seem a little Kafak-esque, don't you think?

Finally, on the more general complaint I have about Jossi Fresco, I do invite you to take some time, if you would, and review his editing of the Rawat articles.  He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader, a man who still has many, many followers who believe that he is God in human form.  Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man.  The fact that he's a Wikipedia administrator is worrying, in my opinion.  18:13",0

YOU ARE A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.

You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in yourCarry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual  life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.

""",0
"""

, please, just think about what you're saying here. Let's take this by the numbers:

 Firstly, quite frankly, I am dissappointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the diffs and information I posted at User talk:Black Kite . Your suggestion that HighKing should """"step back from this type of edit"""" is, quite frankly, going to be ignored, again, as his edits on The Automobile Association showed. His admission that he has a problem sounds depressingly familiar. After 5 years of being unable to contain this problem himself, and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it still exists, then coming as it did off the back of yet more of the usual erroneous defences, duplicitous denials and improper deflections, is surely wholly unsatisfactory.
 's close was both abusive and counter-productive. He closed a perfectly valid complaint, based on completely irrelevant reasons, namely my 'status' (further below, and on his talk page). If I had not pressed him about it on his talk page, he wouldn't have even bothered to notify you about it, and you would never have even heard about 's actions at The Automobile Association.
 Your charge of harassment is frankly ridiculous - all I have done with this account is make factual statements about HighKing's current and past behaviour, which you yourself have just repeated today, is still problematic. I am obviously not the IP user he was edit warring with, I never engaged with HighKing, I never reverted HighKing, I never threatened or personally attacked HighKing. All I did was comment on the situation in a factual manner, in the hope other admins would take action in your absence. If me making this sort of contribution spoils HighKing's enjoyment of Wikipedia, who the hell cares, quite frankly? It's simply not harassment. If HighKing was to turn into a model editor tomorrow, then he'd never hear me talking about him ever again. That's not harassment, it's practically the job description of a Wikipedia admin!
 Your block for evading scrutiny - it is entirely pointless. Enforcement of WP:SOCK long ago stopped being about what's good for Wikipedia in many instances, as this block shows. Whatever my history, whether this is a legitimate or illegitimate alternate account, whether I'm blocked or banned, whatever, there isn't a single thing that I could possibly be hiding that would make the edits this account performed look any less valid to an outside observer. Nothing that might be or could be revealed about me, would change their meaning or relevance, and it certainly wouldn't make them any (more) true. The idea that only established can be implicitly trusted to tell the truth on Wikipedia strikes me as extremely dangerous, a view no admin should be seen within a hundred miles of holding, let alone repeating.
 Taking 3 & 4 together, there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block, and so, it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy. And on the issue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harassment charges - you don't even know for sure if this is an illegitimate sock. You don't know if I have a regular account, or if I'm blocked or banned. You're just guessing. For all you know, I might be using an undeclared alternate account because I myself might have previously been the victim of harassment from HighKing, and so I would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my 'regular account' is when commenting on him in future. And given the fact that, as this block shows, being critical of HighKing is seemingly enough to get someone tarred with a charge of conducting a """"long term campaign of harassment"""" without any actual evidence whatsoever, then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in good standing would not want to expose their main account to that sort of smear, as the price of simply commenting on HighKing.
 To expand on the socking issue - rather than being an """"inappropriate"""" use of a sock, when it comes to HighKing, I think its self evident given his past, using a sock when commenting on his behaviour at a venue like ANI is highly appropriate, as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations, namely trying to deflect attention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done, whether it is even relevant or not, and indeed, whether it is even true or not (his habit for example of makin",0

Basically, the multi-propose Approval Voting we recently used, is designed precisely for that. Approve an alternative means approval, no vote to an alternative means oppose. The result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as Irpen wishes with """"approve & oppose"""". The only basic structural weakness of Approval Voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. But even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write """"weak approve"""" or """"strong approve"""" when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. However, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. She simply is difficult. There are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. And thus the vote splits. This being the basic situation, NO VOTING SYSTEM will ever cure it - unless using """"violence"""". Of course a voting system could be designed which favors something and violates some others, and thus a decision will be made - against half of the population who are then totally pissed at. Such voting systems were used by dictators, by oligarchs, etc.

But there are other cases in the contributions list where the user made a change to a false year, and then changed it back to the correct year, either to confuse the anti-vandalism patrollers, or to make the latest edit look like a true and legitimate one.

Speedy deletion of Paul Bliss
 A tag has been placed on Paul Bliss requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

 Genetic information on mtDNA origin of Ainu 

The wiki page includes the Y-DNA origin of Ainu but not the mtDNA study which is bias. The genetic information of Ainu is incomplete, however the study I edited provides good information on origin mtDNA study of Ainu.  If you only include Y-DNA study but not the mtDNA study you  might aswell remove the claim Ainu are haplogroup D2 and blame it on the genetic drift. Many people are asking what is the origin mtDNA of the Ainu, and the study I provided answers that question even though it clearly says it's an hypothesis it's still far better than nothing. The genetic study I provided """" Mitochondrial DNA analysis of Jomon skeletons from the Funadomari"""" revealed excellent information on ancient Jomon skeleton before the migrations of the Yayoi skeleton. This means there is an very high chance that the N9b and M7a study were pre-jomon mtDNA contribution to modern Japanese mtDNA pool.

"This is a controversial case around the world, not just in America.  Many people in the UK (including me) believe that in time, the proceedings so far will prove to have been a major miscarriage of justice and UK newspapers are increasingly reporting it as such e.g. London Evening Standard - 14-10-10.  The case is notable, not just as another  murder, but for the breathtakingly incompetent nature of the investigation and for the internet wide sociological phenomena of a modern day 'witch hunt' pursued by those who think that Knox and Sollecito are guilty.  The entry above illustrates this.  The introduction of racism into the debate is unnecessary.  The protagonists need to be judged on evidence.  Implying that race is a factor is arguably inflammatory and seeks to divert attention from the evidence.

2) Are Akua-ino supposed to be equated to ghosts and goblins here, or are they haunting the island at the same time as the ghosts and goblins?

Suggested rephrasing (assumptions - previously offered English rendering was accurate, Akua-ino haunted the island in addition):
The name Lānaʻi is of uncertain origin, but the island has historically been called Lānaʻi o Kauluāʻau, which can be rendered in English as """"day of the conquest of Kauluāʻau."""" This epithet refers to the legend of a Mauian prince who was banished to Lānaʻi for some of his wild pranks at his father's court in Lāhainā. The island was haunted by Akua-ino, ghosts, and goblins.

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew.

 The Jayways 

The Jayways. A 5 piece band from the depths of essex. With all five members collaborating with writing songs something new arises repeatedly from the practice studio creating fresh indie songs in a contemporary style with a strong 60's back bone. This comes from the strong influences from bands such as the Beatles and the doors. Their sound has been compared to bands such as the strokes, with elements of the kooks, but the unique soulful voice of the front man (Gerry) gives them a distinctive edge. The band formed in January 2007 and begun recording together at their home based studio almost immediatley. A strong response through myspace rapidly built up and in no time at all there was a buzz around their area and the band. As a result they packed out the grand hotel in leigh-on-sea on there first ever gig. This has snow balled into many of the other southeast venues in which the band play in and have seen them repeatidly asked back to perform again as a result. They have not just played venues all over Essex but also London and Liverpool. The band have recently been recording professionally in a music studio called Sensible Music owned by Jeff Alan. They have been produced by the renound producer Jon Moon who has worked with the likes of Amy Winehouse and The Kooks. This has inspired the band to create a record which is desting for the ears of indie inthusiasts.

The statement is an opinion cited, not a fact. Besides there is no such academic discipline as study of the relics yet -anyone can publish whatever wants. In the lead, we have two negative opinions, by Erasmus from 1500s, and by Thurston from 1913. So the lead is not neutral.

Claims not supported or claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community. Be particularly careful when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them. 

There is no conspiracy to silence these claims.  This account is problematic because Twain's work seems to indicate that the 350,000 people do not exist in Twain's time, or that there are much less people than 350,000 living in Palestine.  Verified and peer-reviewed sources indicate that there were 350,000 people in the area concomitant to Twain's visit.  Thats what needs to be said in a section on demographics, not the musings of a satirist and fiction author.

Self-published sources

Main article: Wikipedia:VerifiabilityA self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It includes personal websites, and books published by vanity presses. Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources.Exceptions to this may be when a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise Twain's work is also in breech of this portion of WP:RS as well.  His accounts cannot be considered verified or subject to any form of independent fact-checking.  He is also not a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise.

Since There are no accurate estimates of population at the time so laregely scholars can relate to the observations of travelers at the time'' is clearly wrong and we do have accurate estimates of population at the time, it is clear that we need to use these and expunge the article of all non-scholarly sources, including the Herbert Samuel link I contributed earler.",0
"stars vs ranks 

I'd like to emphasize that your list is incorrect - ALL of the above are 3 star ranks, independent of how many stars they have in the insignia on their shoulders. 
Take a look at Major General - they are ALL 2 star ranks, but of the 40 insignia displayed on the page, 8 have no stars, 3 have one star and one has three stars. 
General officer#General ranks by country displays 26 insignia.
Admiral#Admiral insignia by country shows 16 insignia, of which only 5 have four stars.
If you want to continue your comparisons, you might find List of comparative military ranks useful. Also Air force officer ranks, Army officer ranks, Naval officer ranks, Ranks and insignia of NATO and perhaps United Kingdom and United States military ranks compared too.

 Challenge/Response and Backscatter 

One anti-spam proposal has been the challenge/response type of system, which sends challenge messages to unknown senders of incoming mail and awaits a response before delivering a message.  Such systems are generally declared as failures and backscatter is the reason.  Concerning a legitimate message, the challenge would typically be sent to the sender.  However, for spam, this is often a forged address, so such a challenge """"raises the noise floor"""" for its innocent recipient.  Although such a recipient will fail to reply, thus causing the originating spam to be discarded, one is effectively placing the decision into the hands of an unknown third party, who is annoyed by the unsolicited challenge message.

Furthermore, for a challenge to be useful, it must somehow refer to the original message sent, and even include a (partial) copy of such.  When a C/R system does so, effectively it becomes a spam relay.  A spammer, knowing that a certain C/R system includes a copy, will design his message so that the spam payload is among the copied portion, and forge his desired recipient's address as if he were the sender, thus allowing the C/R system to be the actual delivering server of the spam (as a challenge message payload) to his desired target.

The definition of backscatter as used by some individuals very well includes such challenges from C/R systems, especially those which can be tricked by spammers to deliver their message payloads.  Such challenges are not technically """"bounce messages"""" as they are not NDRs but otherwise satisfy all the other common requirements to be considered backscatter (if not spam in its own right).

 Jehovah's Witnesses Related Question 

Hi Jeffro,

I don't remember ever actually writing any Wikipedia comments before, so forgive me if my formatting ends up wonky. I was just looking for lists of Watchtower Publications to help me with my collection, when I stumbled across this page and section: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Watch_Tower_Society_publications#Primary_study_aids

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Watch_Tower_Society_publications#Study_aids

The heading """"These publications are intended to convert interested individuals"""" struck me as a bit jarring and out of place. For one, the immediate next header is: """"Secondary aids are considered just before or shortly after baptism"""" so it is not even consistent. Secondly, I am not sure that I agree with the talk page reason you give for keeping the header, as it includes original research (private interpretation of primary sources) and citations of a publication that might not even apply to all of the books listed, e.g., how does a 1980's Kingdom Ministry support the statement that """"Studies in the Scriptures is intended to convert interested individuals""""? Thirdly and lastly, making statements about intent is always notoriously difficult and subject to conflicting interpretation, while making statements of fact is much simpler and should be preferred.  

With that in mind, a possible alternative header might be something like:

""""These publications are generally considered prior to baptism"""" 

It is concise, clear, consistent with the other headers and doesn't make assumptions about intent, only fact. May I have your thoughts?   
(You have previously commented at Wikipedia Talk pages, and you had mastered Wiki-formatting such as indenting at the time. You also referred to yourself in the third person a few times. I hope you've recovered from that oddity.)
The intended purpose of the 'Bible study' program offered by Jehovah's Witnesses most definitely is to convert individuals to the JW faith, though the students are not told of that goal at the outset of the study. For example:
""""Your goal is to help the student achieve greater insight into the truth, qualify as an unbaptized publisher, and become a dedicated and baptized Witness of Jehovah""""—Our Kingdom Ministry, April 2001, page 5;
Chapter 18 of What Does the Bible Really Teach?, pages 174–183;
Your alternative wording would therefore be misleading, because the students don't start out with any intention of being baptised as members of the religion—they just think they're 'learning more about the Bible'. Your wording would only be suitable if the order of events was a) a person wants to be baptised as a JW; b) they study the necessary literature; c) they get baptised.  
I have added references to the article supporting the fact that the publications are used with the goal of converting individuals.

"vCard & wikiengine 
I where reading Tom Limoncelli Time Management for System Administrators where he mentioned about using wikiengine as a registry for contact information. Then I started to wonder in my small round head about contact format.

vCard sounds quite natural way to save this kind of information. Which leads simply to question how hard it could be to make some notation for contact information when there is way to say this is name, this field is phone number of that previously mentioned name being and so on. If there is notation how to express something then it is quite simple to output vCard, hCard or html table etc. Contact information should be reusable from many different wiki page. I mean that if there's article about HP computer and other about HP printers contact to HP should be single HP contact object.

Unfortunately I don't have glue how code extensions to wiki. I also don't know how much there is contact information in wikipedia, most likely only some. If there would be notation for addresses, phone number etc would anyone use it. Impossible to say. There is also other side of coin. It might be that implementation of contact information notation is just what everybody needed but did not realize needing it. There is also possibility that this idea was completely stupid (actually my ideas usually are not so bright than I self think they are).

Although it is sane and logical, I do not believe there is any policy/consensus to back up your """"archives should never be altered except under very special circumstances that are beyond an ordinary username change"""" logic. Archives would have been full protected if that was the case.
  chi? 

It has been proposed several times to fully protect archives. The reason it is not done is because 1) it would be a large burden that is generally not necessary because few people try to change the contents of archives and even common vandalism in archives is almost non-existent; and 2) there are legitimate edits to be made to the page, even outside of removing real names or potentially libellous statements, such as archiving additional sections, re-factoring, or changing headers, that would be impeded by protecting the page and likewise create additional burden if there were a scheme to have administrators protect and unprotect these pages. —→talk •

"It's a good question. I've kind of gone back and forth on it over the years, but I've been finding lately that when I've been updating licensees as a result of an acquisition, I've been linking the licensees to the owner's page more often (or at least when I remember to do so). In fact, while I was FCC-less today, I was starting to look at categorization of the larger owners, which is kind of related. The only reason I did the iHeartMedia linking today was because I checked my Watchlist last night for the first time in a while, and saw that there'd been a bunch of changes made in error to the licensees a week or so ago. I figured that while I was cleaning them up anyway, adding the link made sense, and then it was suggested to me that the redirects made more sense than the piping.

Yes, I'd say each of the state pages should absolutely be uniform, just the same as how the alphabetical lists are uniform and the frequency pages are at least uniform-ish. I'd lean toward linking all of the columns other than the frequency, although I wouldn't suggest redlinking licensees where the owner doesn't have a page. That said, that's just my opinion - it's a question that should probably be put to the project, to see what those who are still active in the project think.

You know what, forget it.

Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists.

It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.

From Wikipedia:

What counts as a reliable source
Further information: Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources
The word """"source"""" in Wikipedia has three meanings:

the type of the work (some examples include a document, an article, or a book)
the creator of the work (for example, the writer)
the publisher of the work (for example, Oxford University Press).
All three can affect reliability.

Base articles on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is """"made available to the public in some form"""".[6] Unpublished materials are not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. The best sources have a professional structure in place for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.

If available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources, such as in history, medicine, and science.

Editors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:

university-level textbooks
books published by respected publishing houses
magazines
journals
mainstream newspapers.

  
Editors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria. See details in Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources and Wikipedia:Search engine test.""",0

Christian1985's attitude to the Mail is far, far from unbiased. I've read his additions, deletions, comments carefully. In addition, the fact that numerous calls for a controversy area have been silenced is far from unbiased. The fact is, without a controversy section, an article about a controversial paper is not complete.

While this rule creates a double standard"""".  I think this means """"pro se litigants get an unfair advantage"""". Wasn't it you that wrote that?
FYI, I was put in jail  for over 4 months solely for engaging in pro se litigation.  The only way I could get out was to agree to withdraw all pro se litigation. My husband was threatened w jail for paying for me to file a complaint while I was in jail and paying for a typist.  And no, I don't believe there is a a history of """"putting people in jail who think the rules don't apply to them and who can't conform themselves to them.""""  To the best of my knowledge, in civilized countries people are only put in jail for committing crimes and as far as summary contempt use of jail is very limited.

The next part clearly outlines """"how propaganda was used by the tanning industry"""".  EXACTLY AS YOU SUGGESTED I MUST DO. UV Radiation is listed as a class I carcinogen by the World Health Organization, so when the indoor tanning industry reports a one-sided argument, and neglects to mention that their product causes cancer, this is propaganda (in keeping with the definition at the top of the article, which I presume you actually read?).

 Hoover's murder investigation re Kennedy 

The information about Hoover's role in the murder investigation of President Kennedy is well documented.

Hoover personally directed the investigation into the murder of President John F. Kennedy which is often called the """"Crime of the Century."""" The first citation in the Kennedy murder section of the article refers to a report by a congressional committee called the House Select Committee on Assassinations. It issued its report in 1979 after a three year investigation into the assassination of John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy.   The report by the Congressional Committee was critical of the performance by the FBI as well as other agencies. 

The second citation in the section on the Kennedy murder is to the PBS Frontline news show. It was reviewing the official government records that “electrified” top Washington insiders and have been kept secret for over 40 years. These secret documents were obtained by the Assassination Records Review Board many years after they were sealed away from public disclosure. The once secret documents are fascinating, especially as reviewed by PBS.  

Hoover conferred with Nicholas Katzenbach of the Justice Department about how to approach an investigation of Kennedy’s murder. The former Attorney General was grilled by the HSCA 15 years later on why he was intent on convincing the public that neither a left wing conspiracy or a right wing conspiracy was involved in Kennedy's assassination. The copy of his memo is carried by Lancer.  If the reader wants the full version of the testimony by Katzenbach the reader should go to the House Committee Report. 
President Johnson, along with Hoover, also knew about the Oswald impersonator right away  that certainly tends to show a right wing conspiracy with an impersonator pretending to be Oswald trying to contact a """"hit man.""""   Maybe there would be another motive for impersonating Oswald trying to contact a hit man other than to frame him. I don't know what it would be. 

There is no question the FBI, under Hoover, acted as the primary investigative arm of the Warren Commission, and Hoover testified to the Commission as seen from these once secret transcripts of the Warren Commission hearing:
 I have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of President Kennedy   The testimony is unsealed now.

There is no secret anymore about the FBI destruction of evidence. They were caught and its now public knowledge. There is a full pulic record. The agent involved even wrote a book about it.    

The American public does not believe the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission and believes the government has something to hide.  This is what the Assassination Records Review Board believes. 

 Conclusion

Therefore, any editors that think there are other reputable sources that have information please put it in. One should not simply delete well known and documented information just because one doesn't like it. If that were the criteria for deleting information, then Wikipedia would be at the mercy of every public relations firm in the country. Nothing """"negative"""" can be written about a public figure because his or her publicist may find it unpleasant and delete it claiming the information is a """"theory."""" No, the information is documented by reputable sources.

What I can't figure out is why Mr. Hoover's sexual life gets so much space, and yet someone doesn't want information on Hoover's job performance on the biggest case of Hoover's career.

 More useful info 
A voice chat session was conducted soon after the episode 7 release, during which the pure pwnage crew answered questions from fans around the globe. There was quite a bit of interesting info to gain from listening to recordings of the chat session. Some of this info should probably be worked into the article here. One such recording is currently at http://chigau.com/ppchat-edited.mp3 Another artifact related to the show would be Anastasia's blog. However, I cannot ascertain the true nature of this blog (whether it's Anastasia's 'real' blog, or just a prop set up for the show). Despite the fact that it is claimed to be the real blog, during the chat session mentioned above, I find it hard to believe the claim, due to the language used throughout the blog itself.
 July 5, 2005 12:27 (UTC)
 You can bet your life it's not real ;-) 
 The fact that the blog mentions Jeremy being put in the hospital for playing WoW is an obvious give away that the blog is purely fictional.  02:07, August 20, 2005 (UTC)
 Don't be so sure. That's how I felt until I started looking around a bit more. Listen to the chat, read the blog, browse some of their forums. Now I'm not so sure. Considering that the blog starts before the sixth episode it seems pretty real and the way they keep mentioning on the forums that when they have PP meets people can't belive how close to the truth the show is. 
 It's fiction, partly based on real life. Come on, if you think PP is really happening watch the 9th episode.
-someonelse: well actually, i agree with aupajo. I'm not saying that people can shoot micro, or that  dave used to be some kind of micro warrior, but its possible that the crew used to act like they do in the first couple episodes, and changed their ways.

 Reviews of Pure Pwnage 

 by Anonymous (67.140.145.26) Essentially Jeremy embodies the very scum of online gaming in a package that is all too familiar.  Pathetic vocabulary skills, general lack of anything resembling cultural knowledge, and the lifestyle of the perpetual slacker round out the package nicely.  This is, unfortunately, what most people think of when you say 'gamer' unless you're talking about the pen and paper variety, which has it's own features (among them, the thankful lacking of the word """"n00b"""") that set it apart.  All in all I think this is a good parody of the gamer lifestyle, but unfortunately the misguided masses of preteens will attempt to emulate it further than they do on their own.  Online gaming is bad enough these days without stirring up that particular cesspool any more than needed.  In the end, it makes me yearn for the days of my youth when Quake's seperate online client was released.  Those were days when people would actually have intelligent conversation until the server filled up enough for a good game of CTF. (and that was before there even WAS a flag... it was a key)  Now, it's all n00b fagz0rz l0ll0rz!!!11!!!1one and corpse humping until you get bored and leave.  I can only hope that this scathing satire of that type of behavior will help show new gamers how NOT to act.

and what, may i ask, does this pov have to do with wikipedia? 

Not much, if not anything. This review was moved here after a Wikipedian noticed it in the main article and decided not to just scrap the whole thing.

"The distinction I would draw is whether the content is published and accepted.  Wikipedia:No original research#What_is_excluded.3F gives a list of seven criteria for determining whether or not something is original research ... but really what it boils down to is whether or not you can find other secondary sources making the same claim.  I had never heard of this tomb before this evening so obviously I don't know enough about it to say what is and is not accepted science in this respect.  ;)  From what you are saying, it sounds like there are two questions - (1) is it appropriate to discuss the symbolism findings in the article and (2) if so, is it appropriate to cite your work.  In the case of the former, it depends on whether or not this has become an accepted finding.  Is it still a theory or has it gained acceptance?  Have other authors picked up on it and do they cite it as accepted truth or as a new theory?  The primary reason for the original research policy is that there are constantly new theories coming out about everything - Jimbo (the founder of Wikipedia) originally mentioned physics, but I think it applies to any field.  Some theories are good for a term paper or thesis and never see the light of day again.  Others become accepted truth over time.  Wikipedia is not the place for giving a sounding board to new ideas and theories - we wait until they are accepted.  The second question is whether, if this content is to be included, it would be appropriate to cite your book.  I believe, as I said before, that you (personally) should not add it, but should let someone else do it - that's just basic journalistic integrity - we as individual editors don't promote our own stuff.  Blogs are almost never considered appropriate ... so I really don't think having a link to your blog would be a good idea.  Sources on Wikipedia should be peer-reviewed journals, newspapers, etc, where more than one person is responsible for the content.  Blogs are generally a bad thing.  I hope all this helps ...

Actually, the word could just be changed to """"religious belief(s)"""" - rather than simply """"religion"""" as it stands - or something similar, and for that, I think """"deism"""" could be used since it's seemingly the most accepted stance he had (or am I wrong)? `98.168.192.162

Sure the British were impressing """"American"""" subjects into the Royal Navy and the NATIVE AMERICANS were at times hostile but the Americans weren't saints. To be honest the War of 1812 was one of the biggest disasters America has faced - their invasion of Canada bloodily repulsed, Native Americans supported by the British and Canadians, A British Army torching Washington DC (in retaliation for the torching of York during the winter season) and ending up marching at will around central america doing what they wanted until a peace treaty was signed. American prestige was only """"restored"""" after a meaningless battle in New Orelans AFTER THE WAR ENDED. Regardless of what people say, this war did not prove Young America could hold their own against the old world, it showed they bit off more than they could chew in attempting to subjugate and forcibly liberate Canada against the populace's will. Don't forget half the canadian population were loyalists during the American revolution and Britain was fighting the might of Napoleon in Europe, so the War of 1812 was something of a sideline campaign. I may have rattled on a bit here butI think it just goes to show that that section needs rewriting to seem something other than some super-american-patriotic propaganda machine.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.136.246.144

Coomplaint procedure?

No doubt there is a lot of link spam. But no doubt many contributors of good articles start small and then build the piece in layers. That's completely human and completely understandable. The better recourse would have been to insert that tag about possible deletion, rather than deleting within such a short period of time. I had just created the stub. I am new to Wiki and perceived that I was up against a vandal. Indeed I was. How much more disturbing to learn that the destroyer has some form of administrative rights.

I'm new here, and it's not a paying job, clearly. I'm not sure I want to learn the ropes of Wikipedia politics and egos, as the obvious value of Wikipedia is compelling enough, and the ugliness of personalities warped by power within a volunteer effort is unhealthy to that effort. The impulse to characterize someone who stands up for their contribution as """"nasty"""" or """"threatening"""" ... the see-what-I-mean response to a contributor not aware of the emotional satisfaction some may draw from arbitrary deletions, from deliberately provoked confrontations to assure themselves of their own power, is sad. All my foregoing comments no doubt cements some of you more firmly in your smugness and self-satisfaction. Regardless of the barnacles that cling to its hull, I assert that the Wiki concept is, fortunately, apparently more powerful than the base human dynamics it nurtures  but does not ultimately tolerate.

i am asked to let it drop. I don't claim to be a Wiki expert, but I bet there is a complaint procedure. Anyone care to point me in the right direction? The article stub was summarily deleted three times, but after that, the vandal chose to insert an alert of possible deletion instead. This indicates to me that the proper procedure was not followed the first three times. What's the complaint procedure? My further complaint will be regarding the dynamic of portraying someone who stands up for themselves in a reasoned and civil way as having an attitude problem. That's probably the most corrosive thing to a volunteer effort.""",0

 Ramdasia section: Reverts by you 

I would like to know why you have reverted the Ramdasia page?
I have constantly provided valid links and proofs but the user Ravinder121 is deleting them without providing any information why and is not engaging in any kind of discussion regarding this.

My argument is that Ramdasia is a subcaste of Chamars but because Chamar are a traditionally a """"lower caste"""" this seems to have offended Ravinder121. Any proof or links that I provide backing up my claim are very quickly deleted by him, while he himself provides none or links that just offer vague associations.

 Moving Teras Kasi from """"Movies and Television"""" to """"Games"""" 

 
Though the game Masters of Teräs Käsi is set in the Star Wars universe, the fighting style exists only in video games, namely Masters as well as Star Wars: Galaxies. It has never been mentioned in the movies, and is not part of the canon. I propose that this entry be moved to the games section.

Teras Kasi is also part of several Star Wars novels written by Steve Perry. So it is not just used in games, it is is also used in several of Steve Parry's star wars novels.

JJL, 23 November 2005
Tai Shing Pek Kwar is a real style of monkey kung fu, not (or in addition to?) a fictional one. It's the style of Paulie Zink. Does it belong here?

On Taejutsu, it was not invented by Seth McFarlane for """"Family Guy"""", although he might have thought so at the time. Taejutsu is actually the name of the unarmed fighting style which is part of Ninjutsu. See any book by Stephen K. Hayes.

Thats Taijutsu, different spelling. Also I second the moving the Teras Kasi thing, never been in or near the movies, and I don't believe that it does have any relation or connection to the the Force, the article on it certainly says nothing about that. Lastly is Fuck You not infact a joke Mike Myers said in So I Married An Axe Murderer, not a fictional martial art from that movie?  

 Miss Ho style 

While drunken boxing is real, the drunken Miss Ho style Wong Fei Hong makes up is not.

Miss Ho is one of the eight drunken immortals of legend, and her movements are part of the Eight Immortals Style, as well as other forms of Drunken Boxing.

Also, wouldn't lightsaber fighting be broken up into the dark side and the light side?
 In fact, it is mentioned in canon resources that there are seven traditional lightsaber fighting styles (or, they are mentioned up through seven), though their exploration is done entirely in non-canon.

What about adding the martial arts from Naruto? Tekken Taijutsu (with its swirling leaf attacks and inner gate openings), Jyuken Taijutsu with its Dim Mak-ness, etc.

 CQC 

I've seen references and articles that state that CQC is a real combat system and the MSG3 CQC style is simply a version with a alternative history and modified for gameplay. Not really a fictional MA. Someone should check this out. 

I believe CQC is real only because I saw it on many websites describing it's origin (all are the same), The history channel, and...wikipedia >_> I'll just go ahead and remove CQC from the list. 

""""CQC"""" is an acronym for """"Close Quarters Combat"""". It's just a generic term for armed and unarmed close combat tactics, not a specific art, although there are several military and paramilitary organizations that use it to refer to their hand-to-hand training systems. On the other hand, the thing featured in MGS3 is a specific fictional art, albeit inspired by real-life tactics...

 Napoleon Zervas 
 Dear Helladios can you stop deleting my input. You have no right to censore someone elses opinion. You are not God. Napoleon Zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the cham albanians

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses a",0

 Agreed. I have most of my experience in book design (mostly history of """"book design"""", pre-Gutenbergian period) and do consider myself only vaguely familiar with web design. But I understand that through history images have posed a problem to """"book designer"""". If images exist there (on the page) in their own right and the page is as much an image as a carrier of the text, the layout can be (and usually is) """"creative"""". But in such towards written information and legibility orientated enterprises as wikipedia this is not a sensible approach. Furthermore, the images are only thumbs (pointers) and only full size image gives the full impression.

"The very reason why there are only 52 bits used for addressing in PAE mode is that the very first 8086 processor using segmentation to address physical memory, where segment register such as CS is 16bit but referring 20-bit long segments after shifting 4 bits to the left. Keeping this schema, if there were 32bit real mode, then 20 bits (used for referring segments) + 32 bits (base address) = 52 bits (for logical addresses). But this is not the truth, but just a guide to draw the reason why. In Intel64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, it says M is an abbreviation for MAXPHYADDR, which is at most 52, where M is used in PDE, PTE and PPDE without further explanation. But I don't believe, for AMD64 architecture, that would be the extreme limit for the physical addressing. If further AMD64 processor gets rid of legacy mode completely, then there would potentially 63bits for addressing physical memory rather than 52bits, like it in Itanium architecture. That might be wrong, but just put a stop to end this topic.",0

"Name and scope 

I'm not happy with the name or scope of Category:Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland. I see it's a subcat of Category:Roman Catholic sex abuse cases by country; I don't know about other countries  but it's not the right name for encompassing all the interrelated issues in Ireland. Pretty much every word is questionable.

 There is abuse, subtypes child abuse and sexual abuse, and the intersection child sexual abuse.  Many institutional abuse victims, especially girls, were not sexually abused. Magdalen laundries' inmates were mostly not children. 

 All these can occur either in the context of a Catholic religious organisation or elsewhere.  Not all institutions were run by religious orders, or by Catholics.   

 Not all sexual scandal resulted from abuse (arguable example Eamon Casey).  Not all abuse results in scandal; aggregate abuse statistics can never be NPOV described as scandalous.

 Does Ireland mean the island or the state? The state institutional setup was different in Northern Ireland, but the diocesan setup was not.  (Brendan Smyth)

I'm not sure the ultimate supercat Abuse in Ireland would be an appropriate name. But I do think some overall rejigging and renaming is needed; and if convenient then subarticles and subcategories could supplement it.",0

"""heading. My common usage understanding of the word is that it means statistical information about something, or the study thereof. My own 1990 dictionary says demographics: data resulting from the science of demography, and demography: the scientific study of human populations, especially with relation to their size, structure and distribution. So on that basis, the articles would be correctly titled 'demographics of...', and quote lots of statistics. It would appear to me that, according to my quite large dictionary, the article is wrong in its definition of these two terms. At the least, it should explain that there is a possible different understanding of the terms.
My own interest was how broad the term demographics is, and whether when discussing a population it would include information about the land area, climate, how wet it is, all that sort of stuff which undoubtedly affects and influences the people living there, even though it might not be the sort of information collected by modern advertising executives. I suspect that a difference in understanding of the terms has crept in because such people are only interested in a subset of the total information.

Once human population is no longer an essential part of the study (as in climate, landmass etc. which will be the same regardless of population) it is no demography; I do agree that if climate has an effect on the population (e.g. in the arctic region people tend to protect themselves against cold) it is interesting from demography; but without such reference not.   

Non-families

I notice that a lot of Wikipedia articles use some sort of template putting households into four categories: """"had children under the age of 18 living with them"""", """"were married couples living together"""", """"had a female householder with no husband present"""", and  """"non-families"""". These categories do not add up to 100%;, for examples see Downers Grove, Willowick, Ohio, etc etc. Any ideas about where this came from, and how it can be addressed? It seems like a category generated as part of a marketing strategy. Novickas 

Generational Cohorts
Are those born during the brief 1977-83 period generation-less?

That's exactly what I was thinking what's the deal??  I'll quote below

""""Generation X cohort (born from 1965 to 1976)

Except the video I haven't seen anyone naming him as Mohammed Afroz except the video of IndiaToday earlier tagged there and as far as I remember the Delhi police never revealed his name. So I am highly doubtful. Despite whatever his name is, WP:BLPNAME prevents from naming someone whose name has been intentionally omitted officially including in court records and isn't allowed to be named publicly. In the case of a rape victim, the family can reveal the name and the family of Nirbhaya did. However the juvenile isn't allowed ti be named under Juvenile Justice Act. Additionally the victimisation and probable threat on his life if his name is revealed also makes another case why his name shouldn't be there whether the name the sources gave might be wrong or true. Therefore, I am in agreement the previous edit versions containing all the various versions of his real name like Sunil and Mohammed Afroz should be deleted.   04:06, 8",0

"Let me be crystal clear here:  If pending changes are removed by any admin from any article, that admin is responsible for replacing them with either semi- or full protection (level 1), or full protection only (level 2), each with the same duration as the duration of the pending changes protection, whether or not the originally protecting administrator takes any action with respect to the RfC's closure.  This is due to the fact that any number of BLP subjects have threatened to sue Wikipedia for allowing defamation in their articles, and pending changes has been part of our good faith response.  This cannot easily be determined on-wiki, as most of the complaints and responses are in OTRS, rather than any on-wiki venue.  While I've made my honest best effort to include references to OTRS tickets when appropriate in protection summaries, there's no guarantee that the absence of any such OTRS ticket number indicates that the pending changes can be dropped.  Note also that non-BLP articles may have been placed under pending changes protection for BLP reasons, so an article on e.g., a corporation placed under pending changes protection may not be assumed to be not a BLP-relevant article.  Furthermore, regardless of the merit of such lawsuits, the fact is that Wikipedia's BLP goals are to do no harmit's an ethical stance with worldwide acceptance.
The removal of Pending Changes as a tool does not change our obligation to BLP subjects in any way; it merely removes a tool that allows trusted non-autoconfirmed and non-administrator users to make changes to such articles.  If anyone was under the impression that the end of pending changes would automagically open any protected articles for free-for-all editing, they have likely not thought through the real world implications of BLP.

 Armenian Genocide 
Peres' denial of the genocide should be noted in this article, failing to do so makes it more of a hagiography than a biography. His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment: 

Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation)   

Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his """"views,"""" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this """"view"""" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture.

You can not """"posit"""" the sources aren't solid enough by offering the fact they also use Prso's nickname in addition to his real name as a supposed proof of their lack of solidity. Ludicrous. The fact that Prso mostly goes by his nickname, Dado, does not make his real first name, Miladin, non-existent. And his real name being Miladin IS backed up by numerous reliable sources. The fact that sources mentioning Prso's real name Miladin also use his nickname Dado is a """"inconsistent"""" only in your world. No one disputes he mostly goes by Dado.

You've been removing verified info from Dado Prso over the span of 8 years already (whilst with a straight face characterizing the work of other editors' as """"harping""""), standing guard against, and I quote, """"Serb nationalist talking points"""", a """"thinly veiled political advocacy"""", and an """"unverified Serbian name claim"""". 

Not to mention accusing people of WP:Point. Precious. I guess including information backed up by reliable sources qualifies as """"proving a point"""" in your little world.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, examples of Wiki BLPs titled according to the person's nickname, and all of them have the the person's real first name included in the lede:
Co Adriaanse (Jacobus """"Co"""" Adriaanse)

Matt Busby (Alexander Matthew """"Matt"""" Busby)

Marco van Basten (Marcel """"Marco"""" van Basten)
Uli Hoeneß (Ulrich """"Uli"""" Hoeneß)
Toe Blake (Joseph Hector """"Toe"""" Blake)
Cotton Fitzsimmons (Lowell """"Cotton"""" Fitzsimmons), and so on, and so forth (just to keep it to the sportspeople)

Somehow I don't see any sign of you over the last 8 years on any of those bios, removing the individuals' first names from their articles' respective ledes nor are you spewing any of your wikilawyering nonsense on those article's talk pages, complaining that the real name sources are """"internally inconsistent"""" (btw, most of the bios don't even provide sources for the first name information) or pointing out that the person's nickname is more widely used than his first name as basis to remove the first name from the lede. 

Also, whatever happened to that earlier claim of yours about including Dado Prso's real name in his bio constituting """"thinly veiled political advocacy"""", and an """"unverified Serbian name claim""""? Considering there are numerous non-Serb sources stating Dado Prso's real name to be Miladin, do you still see it as a Serb nationalist effort? 

So to recap. There are reliable sources meeting WP:BLP criteria under WP:SOURCE and WP:NEWSORG as 'factual content' (including a well-established news agency with numerous reprints) that explicitly state his real name is Miladin. No amount of wikilawyering from your end can change this basic fact.  """,0

 Neutrality? 

""""There are also allegations that the attention and sympathy especially from the Australian public and media may be related to xenophobic sentiment and a unfair mistrust of Asian legal systems. Also, many think there was no motive for Corby to transport marijuana from Brisbane to Bali where the value is far less, and where it is readily available on the street not far from her prison (and even within it), i.e. it would be like smuggling ice to Eskimos.""""

This seems POV to me.  (Of course, in the interests of full disclosure I believe that she is guilty).

I added some referencing to a Sydney Morning Herald article where it was alleged that Australian marijuana (in particular hydroponically grown marijuana) sold quite well in Bali for a few reasons:
 Indonesian marijuana is quite poor in quality - rich tourists generally prefer the Australian stuff.
 Due to the lack of entrapment laws in Indonesia, tourists can often be caught by Balinese police stings - and so prefer to buy their marijuana off other whites, who are less likely to be members of the Indonesian police.

I can understand the text on the (turns out to be non-lethal) white powder being sent to the embassy being removed.  I believe that even though a link hasn't been established between the two events that this incident will have a bearing on the case, and especially its portrayal (spelling?) in Indonesia, but I can see why the lack of a clear connection between the two events has led to its removal.

That said, I cannot understand why the text on """"smuggling ice to Eskimos"""" is allowed to remain whereas the text from the Sydney Morning Herald, a respected (within Australia at least) news source is not.  If the view that there would be no point smuggling marijuana to Indonesia is allowed to remain, why not the view that there would be a point, especially if that view is put forward by a major Australian newspaper?  The article seems POV and biased in favour of Corby to me.

 HADAS    
   
Hi - you recently declined my submission on HADAS (Hendon and District Archaeological Society) as failing WP-ORG. The last comment from Fetchcomm seemed to be that if I put inline citations in it would be fine - which I did. Is there something I can do to change the article and resubmit it?

 Tactical Unit (film series) rating    
   
Hello, I was wondering if you could check some of the links on Tactical Unit (film series) to see what grade it should get. I gave it a B but that might be high. We should also consider WP:DYK as it seems very well-sourced and of decent quality. Certainly not a stub. Thanks, (55)(55) 9:23 pm, 6 January 2010, Wednesday (30 days ago) (UTC−5)   
Thanks. I'm not an expert, but B seems good (though I may have gone with a C). As for DYK, I'm not too familiar with the selection process (more of an ITN guy myself), but I'd say go for it if you can find a suitable hook. ~  (Talk|Edits) 12:24 am, 7 January 2010, Thursday (29 days ago) (UTC−5)

 Denied because of copyright    
   
I had a page about Ervin Marton denied recently by you because of copyright infringement. The page I quoted from is a page that I did write myself. I am not sure where or how I can prove that to you, but I will if needed. Also, if that would help, I will be glad to delete that biographical web page I wrote myself as a Wikipedia page would replace it.   
What should be my next step. I am a total newbie with Wikipedia?   
Thanks.    
It is hard to communicate all of this when I write my proposal. Also, just in case you have any advice, I am not able to input text when I open up the Wiki chat web pages, I see text but am not able to enter text into them.

"Hey Sas87, the article of the 20th has a photo of the testers at his house. I believe that they went first at the pool and then at his house. The point is not where they went, but that they did went to where ever Ian told them that he will be, and he was not there. That by it self is unprofessional and against ASADA regulations, as stated from all the articles quoted from the ASADA website. You are a pro, you give ASADA a 3 month calendar to where you will be each day so you can be test. If you are picked for a test, you have to be there within an hour or tell ASADA to wait for a bit more cause you are stack at the lights!!! When our top cricketers announced that they resign, they did it in full view without hiding behind curtains. Ian is responsible for ruining his pro image, not the media. I only want the documented facts to be available and I see no reason why we should not duplicate what all the newspapers had on their front page those days. Are we all suffering from selective memory? Sas, although Blnguyen gave me the OK, I will not put this in the main page, if you still thing it is not appropriate.",0

 Context  
To fully understand the nature of Limbaugh's comments, full context of the entire conversation must be included in the article. On the September 26, 2007, radio broadcast of The Rush Limbaugh Show, Limbaugh received telephone calls from two listeners regarding the Iraq War. The first caller, """"Mike in Chicago"""", who identified himself as a Republican and former service member, told Limbaugh, """"I do believe that we should pull out of Iraq."""" Limbaugh argued with the caller and ended up treating him dismissively.  After that call, Limbaugh next spoke to a listener who wanted to """"retort to Mike in Chicago"""" (the original caller).  This second caller, who identified himself as a soldier,  complained that the media never talked to """"real soldiers"""" like himself.  He was clearly responding directly to the first caller, who had told Limbaugh he felt the Iraq War was a mistake.  The current version of the article only contains the conversation with the second caller.  It doesn't make it clear that the second caller's remarks are in response to """"Mike in Chicago""""'s anti-war comments.  This second caller never mentioned Jesse Macbeth at all.  With the addition of the first conversation, the New York Times response that Limbaugh's """"phony soldiers"""" comment was """"referring to Iraq war veterans critical of the war"""" makes sense.  As is, this article is heavily skewed in favor of Limbaugh.  Both sides of the controversy need to be presented.  Right now, this article is simply a Limbaugh-fanatic's wet dream.- """,0

"LK-a couple of thoughts. 1) It's counter productive to call someone's good faith efforts WP:agf to improve an article (ie reverting your edits) vandalism.  Think twice before making that claim. 2) please read WP:npov carefully.  I am not going to debate whether Islam and yellowstone can be reliably sourced, but I will contend that it's a topic that will violate undue weight of our NPOV policy when seen in the light of the yellowstone article and is unlikely to be allowed to remain.  There are 1,000s of tidbits of content that could be added to article, but aren't because of undue weight.

For the record, we tried """"calm and reasonable"""" many times.   However, when you have a vigilant troll that recruits his """"friends"""" into a swarm, they are all one in the same to me.   I personally, one on one, had a lengthy discussion with Jim Wales.  It does not get any more serious than that.   He overrode everything bye everyone, himself, while I waited.   This due to the fact that I DID involve legal entities and board members.  I was heard.   But I refuse to involve him again in this bullshit.    YOU all need to take a step back and see the big picture.  It's great that you are invested in this project, but you really have to evaluate the situation a LOT longer before you start blocking people.   You are equal to anyone that uses this site. Unfortunately, some have need for grandiose attention.  anyway, I am beyond a nice guy, and the celebs I work for are beyond nice people that don't deserve ANY of this crap.   Sam Harris for example, if you go way back, had a great page going, and the same trolls have edited it down to a couple lines.  Fine with me, but, the link to the official web site MUST and will always stay.  It's common sense, and as I have always said, not a discussion.  Stating a fact is not being rude. This includes stating the fact that a person is a moronic troll.

"Um, can anyone verify Mary Elizabeth Sheridan?
She's listed on IMDb and recently had her 121st birthday but she's nowhere to be seen on this wikipedia page. Can anyone do some research or verification?
Link   —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
 Before any such process is started, you should first confirm this person is actually still alive. I strongly doubt that, but in the case she is, it would of course be worth trying to validate her. However, if the birthdate is correct in IMDB, she had her 111th birthday, not 121st.(  )

Oldest people in the world graph
I see that Jughead has added a pretty nifty graph which represents all known oldest people at a given time from 1830 to the present date. But I can see a few problems right off the top - for one, the chart should start from 1955 which is really where the record starts in any substantive manner, as that is when the record started to be kept and subsequently amended back to. While we may be able to compile a list of oldest people going back into the 19th century, besides the fact that patchy birth records make such a compilation somewhat meaningless, any compilation beyond what already exists on this page would be original research. 

Secondly, it is hard to really understand what the graph represents, with a lot of tiny dots. Close clusters of dots really represent  the fact that record-holders held the title briefly, a low cluster means someone held the record for a long time. Which was only really true after 1955. The chart implies that Betsy Baker who is represented by the dot circa 1955 held the record for a whopping 25 years, which is obviously not so. And thirdly, the current record-holder just turned 115, yet is shown as being 116.

My suggestion would be to keep the vertical axis as is, but to create a bar graph for individual years of BIRTH starting with the first record-holder Betsy Baker's birth year, 1842, draw a bar for the maximum age attained for any person born in that year and do the same for each year up to 1892, the most recent birth year for which no people are proven still alive. And this would not be original research, as there is a page with this list: . There is someone for each year save 1845 there.   
Hello. Thanks for pointing out those mistakes, Jack. I'll try to improve the graph soon. Fell free to offer any more suggestions.",0

This is becoming very tiresome.  After the last reasonable attempt at compromise to keep one person (Rothbard) happy as well as everyone else by making the language neutral, Rothbard returned to remove an important qualifying word (""""some"""") and to change """"parliament"""" to """"government"""" and to delete documenting links.  That shows lack of good faith and also lack of understanding of parliamentary government.  Regarding the first point, to criticize a mullah or a priest is not to criticize Islam or Christianity, and to criticize one activist in a movement is not to criticize """"the antiwar movement.""""  That is simple dishonesty to claim otherwise.  Regarding the second point, in a parliamentary system, the word """"government"""" refers to prime minister and cabinet, not to members of parliament.  To advise """"government"""" you are advising the prime minister.  Nothing states that Palmer ever met the prime minister, but he spoke to members of the parliament.  Rothbard is perhaps no political scientist, but there is a major difference between them.  Even under the American system, if someone speaks to members of the Congress, it would be dishonest to write that she or he had come to Washington to """"advise the government.""""  We had reached a compromise and Rothbard indicated that he could live with it, but he has now gone in without any reason and changed the entry to be misleading.  The agenda at work seems more to defame a person than to provide neutrally articulated information. The issue is raised and it's time for Rothbard to simply back off.

"""It's really very difficult to let you down gently, because I find myself accused by you of edit warring which I totally reject. I understand that you might be doing it to pacify Tiamut but it’s unfair to do it at my expense. If I should speak softly then the above wrong image of me might stick in someone’s mind, which is unfair to me. This version that you are reading is a toned down version of the original. If I still hurt you (HG), then I apologize, as my intention is only to clear a wrong image of me in your mind and by extension in the mind of others.

I'm sorry to say, but you're totally off base. I'll take it that you haven't followed the sequence of events and are totally unaware of who edited what. If you would have checked out the exact sequence of events you couldn't have come to such conclusions and made such comments.

Frankly, I am very disappointed in you trying to equate us. While my reputation is unblemished and everyone who has followed me here knows that I'm here to add my knowledge on Jewish subjects for which I have barely scratched the surface, and although I am bold,  I go out of my way to be fair and uphold the neutrality of Wikipedia. Tiamut on the other hand has one agenda, and one agenda only; to push a Palestinian POV. I'm sorry to say, but your trying to put her in a good light rings hollow. Please check out what many other editors have said about her and then tell me if you still think so. Sorry I cannot sit back and watch you trying to equate us. By equating us you are actually smearing my character and exonerating her which is really not fair. It seems to me that she cannot do any bad and I cannot do very much good; that's the impression I get from your comments.

Here are some things you say which I find incorrect or disturbing. The reason I am calm is because I have given up on her, given up on the mediators, and almost given up on Wikipedia. Only people who think that they can win or accomplish something are passionate in what they do. I'll talk straight and pull no punches. I made my comment on your page only to show you that Tiamut is lying, in the belief that maybe you’ll open your eyes. Tiamut hasn't gotten under my skin at all; I know what she is up to and want to stop it; but if you (not you necessarily) will try to stop me instead of her, then I'll bid all of you good bye and let you have what you deserve. I have no softer way of putting it, that I just can't take this crap that Tiamut thought it reasonable to add """"nation"""" to the opening paragraph. No, she knows exactly what she is doing and such comments are what lets her get away with it. While Tiamut has lost her temper many times; I haven't lost my temper even once; disappointed, yes; lost temper, no. You say that you're surprised that Tiamut didn't go to the talk page earlier; I wonder why you're surprised; don't you see that she first tries to get away with whatever she can, then she'll engage in talk with no intention of compromising but to get part of her pushing accepted and put off the rest for another round. You say that I started my conversation with a negative touch by its heading of POV pushing. My purpose is not anymore to set her straight, which I have already given up. My purpose is to point out her POV pushing to all of you. Actually I think that I'm treating her with kid gloves compared to how administrators would have dealt with her, if they only wanted to. Lastly I completely object to your equating us both as edit warring. When one side explains, but the other side says one thing on the talk page and does something else on the article; then the explainer shouldn't be labeled an edit warier simply to be able to play the equation game. Please get it straight; I am an honest editor and she is a POV pusher, and the twain doesn't meet. She needs to be admonished not mediated; you cannot mediate with someone who will only play the game of mediation with no intention of good faith editing.

Her response to you is a game which allows her to do what she wants while she is engages in dilly-dallying and in false placation. Tiamut has learned to play a game with all of you. She pretends to engage in discussion but in reality does what she wants and then has the audacity to reverse the sequence of events to make it look as if she thought she was doing the right thing. Now watch her threaten that she will report me; that's also part of her game, and if she succeeds then Wikipedia doesn’t deserve any better.   

It's time to call a spade a spade; because otherwise Wikipedia will lose its valuable editors and stay with the crap. I’m really fed up with Wikipedia, and ready to bid everyone farewell.

I think the answers to these questions are unfortunately a bit muddled.  Initially I was going to say that the Public Relations Officers who wrote those articles may have inserted the term without thinking (or knowing).  However one possibility is that since ISAF is a reaction to the Bonn Agreement, it may be considered peacekeeping with the parties including the fledgling national government and the various quasi-legitimate warlords.  But the Taliban and Al-Qaeda are not parties to any agreement.  To my understanding, without an agreement in place between sides, there is no peacekeeping.  """"Security Assistance"""" (the SA in ISAF) to me is a subset of the military term """"peace support operations"""" (peacekeeping is another subset of peace support operations).  In the end, I think the NATO and ISAF webpages must be authoritative, and I have seen no mention of the term """"peacekeeping"""" on any of the main documents I have looked at.  I don't claim to be an authority, and soldiers (and bureaucrats, and politicians) argue about the meaning of words all the time, but to me 'peacekeeping' has a specific meaning that ISAF does not fit.

 I heard you like hamburgers. 

  The Hamburglar is a McDonaldland character who features in McDonald's commercials. He is a close friend of Ronald McDonald, Grimace, and Birdie. Even though he has always attempted (and failed) to hoard all the hamburgers in McDonaldland for himself, he has always been looked upon as a valued member of the McDonaldland community.

History
Despite a few changes made to his appearance over the years, he has always been endearingly loved by fans all over the world. A pint-sized burglar who first appeared in March 1971 and was one of the first villains on the commercials. He was dressed in a black-and-white hooped shirt and pants, a red cape, a wide-brimmed hat, and red gloves. His primary object of theft was hamburgers, hence his name. The character, like Grimace, started out as a villain, only he was old, had a long nose, gray hair, and was called the Lone Jogger in some 1970s commercials, sporting a shirt that said """"Lone Jogger"""". Hamburglar spoke in gibberish which was often translated by Captain Crook.

He was revised in 1985, when his look changed from a trollish old man to a red-head Dennis the Menace-type child who spoke and wore a shorter-brimmed hat and a black cape with yellow on the inside. His previously-unintelligible muttering was now the familiar """"robble robble."""" In """"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald,"""" he took on a new, sporty appearance wearing green goggles, a leather jacket, striped shirt, shorts and sneakers. He loved playing tricks on his friends and still loved burgers. The last appearances of Hamburglar on television were prime time commercials promoting the dollar menu. Hamburglar was voiced by Howard Morris in most commercials, Charlie Adler in some 1980s commercials and """"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald""""; and Carl W. Wolfe in some 1990s commercials.
Hamburglar 2015
In 2015, new images were released by McDonald's depicting the Hamburglar as a grown man wearing a fedora, a macintosh jacket atop a black-and-white t shirt, with black jeans and with high-top sneakers. He still has a mask, but his face now also sports a good half-inch of designer stubble. The character will be in commercials for the first time since 2002.   """,0

 Srebrenica massacre 

Here's the situation. The Serbian media has made much fuss about the """"3000"""" Serbs killed by the ABiH (Bosniaks) in the Srebrenica region. After that video of 6 Bosniaks came out, the Serbian media (among other things) released a list of names of these 3000 Serbs. However, the Hague has stated that the majority of these aren't considered """"victims"""" (as they were portrayed by the Serbian media) because among these 3000 are a large number of military police officers and Serbian soldiers killed in combat with Bosnian troops. According to data provided by Republika Srpska's Comission on War Crimes, in the Srebrenica region there were 995 Serb civilian victims. All of this was what I was trying to sum up.

 List of functions 

Hi Jitse. I've replied to your question about List of mathematical functions on my talk page.  ☎ 13:20, July 13, 2005 (UTC)

 Jitse Niesen has made a logical fallacy 

I would like to remind Jitse Niesen who claimed the facts below that he has made a logical falacy called """"Appeal To Widespread Belief"""" http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#bandwagon

For example, in the 1800's there was a widespread belief that bloodletting cured sickness. Now we know it to be wrong. Thus, whether it be institutions such as NATO, the Red Sross, or individuals, their mere opinions about an issue cary little force when it comes to making a logical argument. In fact, the use of this falacy in an argument renders the arguemnt invalid; the author who uses Appeal To Widespread Belief is never taken seriously.  

Jitse Niesen wrote:

""""I don't think dividing the sites in """"supporting genocide theses"""" and """"opposing genocide theses"""" is helpful. What you call the Bosnian/NATO point of view, is in fact also the point of view of the UN (including the ICTY), Japan, Indonesia, Red Cross, and pretty much the whole world.""""

(preceding unsigned comment by 212.102.129.250 12:24, 14 July 2005)

I agree that it is indeed a logical fallacy to conclude the truth of some statement from the fact that most (or even everybody) think it is true. However, I don't see where I have committed this mistake. In the second sentence of the fragment quoted to above, I say that the """"Bosnian/NATO point of view"""" is far more widespread than the Serbian one, which implies that it should get more attention since """"[i]f we are to represent the dispute fairly, we should present competing views in proportion to their representation among experts on the subject, or among the concerned parties"""" (quoting from WP:NPOV). What I do believe to be the case, though I am not saying above, is that widespread belief strongly suggests truth.    

 The Truth 

Jitse Niesen wrote:""""Do you have specific suggestions on how we can improve the article?""""
Yes I do. I'll send you some articles on that topic when I have time, because I'm occupied preparing for some exams right now. Also you may take a look at www.ogrish.com, it you have membership credentials. I have some video materials too, showing the torture and death of Serbian civilians but have no way how to send you, but what I can do is to gather, or to write, something on Serbian history and culture that may change views because Serbs are often considered as """"occupators"""" of the Bosnia, but the fact is that they are natives there and the """"Bosniaks"""" are not a nation as they try to represent themselves today. They are merely Serb or Croats converted to Islam during the period of Ottoman Empire reign on the Balkan. Their language is Serbian. But as I said, the picture we have today is a result of politics and lobbying. The same thing is with Kosovo today.

 """"Only to the audience"""" and planning of Angier's shooting 

Can someone please tell me how he recounts his method """"only to the audience""""?  It seems to me that he's explaining his method directly to Borden as he was dying.  He tells Borden to """"look where you are"""" and """"it takes courage to walk in every night not knowing whether I was going to be the prestige or the man in the box"""" (paraphrasing).  Obviously, he doesn't play a video to Borden showing him exactly what we, the audience see, but it was pretty clear to me that these clips were meant to be explanatory not only to the audience, but in a sense to Borden as well.  The phrasing (included below) makes it sound like Borden never finds out how Angier did the trick.

""""Similarly, flashbacks recount (only to the audience) Angier's method: that each time he disappeared during his illusion, he fell into a locked tank and drowned, and the machine created a duplicate who teleported to the balcony and basked in the applause.""""

Also, having just watched the film again, it seems to me that Cutter colludes with Borden to allow Borden in to kill Angier so that Angier can re-unite with his daughter (who he earlier recommends that she """"needs her father."""")  Cutter leaves """"Lord Caldlow's"""" estate disgusted, as he has stolen Borden's daughter and helped frame him for murder.  I assume that he resolved to help Fallon/Borden to get his daughter back after finding out that Lord Caldlow was really Angier.  Thoughts?

 

The ending of the film Angier is still alvie. This is the reason for Caines V.O. asking the audience to """"see it"""" Now if you pause the DVD you will actually see an air bubble rise int he water. How am I the only one who see this? I will keep changing this page till people understand this. Thank you  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 129.42.208.182   
Please review the archive links at the top of this page.  We discussed this when the film was originally released.  — | Talk 

So what are you suggesting? An Angier hid in a water tank, held perfectly still and held his breath for a at least 5 good minutes... For what? If there is an air bubble it's probably because Jackman needed to breathe...  
The air bubble is real; I saw it twice in the theater and on DVD.  I can upload a screen shot from the DVD with the air bubble if necessary.  The point is, other editors have argued that this doesn't mean anything, however what bothers me is this: the Nolan's are really good at what they do.  If we saw the air bubble, then you can bet they saw it, and if it was a mistake, it would have been digitally removed.  The fact that they left it in the film is very interesting, and nicely parallels the end of the novel itself.  On the other hand, it doesn't make sense.  The Angier floating in the tank is clearly dead and has no way of getting out. — | Talk 

 Plot Ending 
In the plot description of this page it states that the film ends with Borden eyeing the water traps containing the dead duplicates of Angier. However, when I saw the film (and I may be mistaken in this) it seemed as if the trap shown immediately before the credits contained a living Angier. This fact was further emphasized when the camera panned away from the burning theatre and to the body of Angier, which had wide open eyes and appeared to be viewing the scene that had just occurred between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, and the credits roled immediately after he came into full view (only showing the body for a second). It may also be that the director included this to leave the audience guessing as to whether or not the body was alive or not and whether Angier did in fact have the last laugh. Either way, a reference to this should be included into the Plot Summary.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
Keep in mind that like most Nolan films, the film is non-linear, so the plot summary synthesizes in many areas, including the conclusion.  This format isn't de rigueur, and improvements are always welcome as long as the plot is short and sweet per WP:MOSFILM.  As for whether Angier has his eyes open or is alive, that is pure speculatio",0

Well all right, at least we are getting some debate on the subject.

Paul Siebert - The main contribution of the FCM 36 was the sloped armor on all sides, with the slope of the hull continuous with the turret, so that the tank ended up with a pyramidal shape and a very small turret.   This was exactly the same shape of the T-34 which appeared some 3-4 years later than the FCM 36 and yet the T-34 gets all the credit and accolades as a """"revolutionary design"""" for its sloped armor.   Well, the French came up with that idea first (p. 247-248 in T-34 Mythical Weapon).    Michulec goes further and points out that the pyramidal shape was highly impractical as it resulted in a tiny turret that was all but nonfunctional as the two crewmen could barely aim, load, and fire the gun.  This was why the initial """"flat turret"""" with the steeply sloped sides was replaced by the slightly larger, and less steeply sloped """"hexagonal turret"""" (p. 245).   The later T-34-85 turret was hardly sloped at all in order to maximize space to fit the larger gun.

As for your point about the dysfunctionality of the T-34-76, the early T-34-76 models were the most dysfunctional because of their tiny, steeply sloped turrets and the weak L-11 gun.  The larger hexagonal turret, which was designed to allow for installation of the more powerful F-34 gun was much more functional, but it was still a two man turret lacking a commander.  That problem was not fixed until early 1944 when the T-34-85 finally rolled off the production lines with a three man turret.  The T-34-76 models thus ALL shared this problem of having nearly blind crewmen trying to fight on the battlefield.  The Germans found it very easy to pick them off like ducks because the tank crews had a very limited field of vision, and no way to communicate with other tanks.  There is a description in Healy's Zitadelle  of an episode at the Battle of Kursk where the Soviet T-34s were charging in  and the Germans would just leisurely pick off the T-34s one by one, with all the surviving T-34s completely oblivious to the mass destruction around them.  That was in July 1943.   Michulec's book does show that the Soviets started installing a commanders cupola on the hexagonal turret in the summer of 1943 (p. 123).  Probably learned something from the heavy losses of the Battle of Kursk that the tank crews needed to be able to see what was going on around them.  

Michulec points out that the tank that the Germans most likely did fear and have a lot of trouble with was the KV-1.  The KV-1 had the really tough armor that was resistant to the early German guns (the T-34's thin side armor could be penetrated by the weak guns of the German tanks of 1941) and it had the three man crew that made it a formidable fighting machine on the battlefield.    The T-34-76 crews could simply not see well enough and function inside that tiny turret well enough to be a serious threat to German tanks.    The problem with the KV-1 of course was twofold - it was very slow and sluggish and did not travel through bad terrain very well, unlike the T-34.  And it carried the name of the later discredited Kliment Voroshilov.   Which is probably why in the Soviet retelling of history, the KV-1 gets only a very brief mention.  All the glory gets heaped on the T-34s, which the Germans had no reason to fear because it was not much of a threat to them on the battlefield, due to its dysfunctional tiny two man turret.  Michulec points out that the German generals, especially Guderian, in all probability confused the KV-1 and T-34 in their memoirs.

DMorpheus - I think you are being a bit harsh with Michulec's book.  But at least you recognize the huge amount of work that he put into this thing.  Yes, the photos and drawings are INCREDIBLE.  I think rather than calling the text """"awful"""", it would be more accurate to describe its two major problems:

1. The book was translated by somebody for whom English was a second language.  Not quite as bad as the translation for the movie """"Alexander Nevsky"""", but a bit difficult to understand sometimes.

2. Michulec goes overboard with his obvious anti-Soviet ranting.  Somebody should have just edited all this out, and it would have made the book more professional.

But, if you are able to slug through the difficult translation and filter out the anti-Soviet bias, what you find is that Michulec has packed his book chock full of facts, and he does reference most of his major facts.  Unfortunately those references all seem to be in Russian or Polish or German.   But I think that is where this book shines over books by Zaloga.    

Here's an excerpt (p. 161):

I disagree that it barely meets the notability guidelines. You have failed to mention other career highlights, such as the music video that was then filmed at Fenway Park on September 25th, 2012.

10:44 EST April 15 2008 - I keep finding pages that have been deleted.  I just added a {unreferenced} tag to a Wiki deletion policy page.  I'm sure I'm not the first person to think of this.  What degree of crap will be flung can only be imagined.   

I undid your edit to ignore all rules, as it was not in the spirit of Wikipedia.  See Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point.

That should be Wikipedia:What """"Ignore all rules"""" means.  Please sign your entries by typing four tildes.

 Except when you violate the rules about creating articles 

You said: Except when you violate the rules about creating articles, in which case the page in violation will be quickly deleted, leaving no trace of what occurred. Even the conversation about it may be deleted forever. This comment, like everything else on this page, does not cite sources. This comment may also be in violation of some rule.

That's an interesting point. Several people are starting to look into issues with the deletion system already. Will you be helping out with that?   

> Hi Kim.  I don't know what """"looking into"""" even means, in regards to Wikipedia. I don't know who people are, who does what, or who created the rules.  I don't know what """"helping out"""" means, in regards to your question.

My first effort here, at creating an entry, was put up for deletion in 4 minutes, then deleted without discussion by some admin.  Now I can't find the brief discussion about that. 

But it led to the realization that many many pages here, the ones that state policy and rules for wikipedia, don't cite sources.  The pages don't list authors either.  They are nebulous pages, that don't follow the rules those pages insist I follow.

Interesting?  Damn right it is interesting.  I've read a lot of criticism of wiki, and defended wikipedia for years.  But now, well, I see a huge flaw in the system.

 Is user:Nakon some kind of Bot? 

I have no idea what happens on Wikipedia sometimes.  While reading the ALS entry, due to a friend having been diagnosed with it, I followed a link to the ALS Association, which gave me that page that says there is no article.  I looked it up on Google, and created a short starter page on it.  

Right after I hit create, I realized there was already an entry, but it was under ALS Association, so I hit edit this page, to make it a redirect. It came up as deleted!  In a matter of seconds, some asswipe called Nakon had deleted the page.

(Deletion log); 03:28 . . [Nakon]  deleted """"The ALS Association"""" (CSD A7 (Corp): Article about a company that doesn't assert significance)

Considering there already was a page, and it certainly is significant, the ultrafast deletion is an example of some kind of fucked up mentality.  This idiot has to be using some kind of software to scan every new article, and s/he must have spent 2 seconds before hitting some sort of deletion key.

Unbelievable.  This level of bullshit goes beyond anything I have ever encountered on the Internet before.  If I had changed the entry to a redirect, I would have missed the event.

 xenocide against me 

I am the foremost expert in the world on Ho-Chunk mythology, at least outside this N. American Indian tribe. There was a stub on this subject that had a short re-written excerpt from my website, so it occurred to me that since there was essentially nothing there, I could perform a service by writing an overview of Ho-Chunk mythology. I had spent three days carefully writing the first three sections of this with an enormous number of footnotes, when some hobbledehoy put in a section extolling the garbage-like ideas of my bitterest academic enemies. Fortunately, only a very small fraction of what I was going to write was entered. I assumed that if this outsider wanted to intrude in the middle of my project, that it would be alright to remove my part of the contribution and give him free rein to do whatever it was that he wanted in pursuing his competing thesis. It makes no sense to me to have a highly scholarly article riddled with severe inconsistencies. That I can't remove my very own contribution is infuriating. 

However, the good news is that my lawyer thinks that I have a good position on this. I took material out of my copy writted website with the thought that at some point I could say, """"reproduced by permission of the author"""". However, I hadn't yet gotten around to that when my article was destroyed by an ignoramus intruder. That means that almost all of it violates my own copy-write. Therefore, under the present circumstances, I not only may withdraw it, but I must withdraw it according to your own rules. I resisted these attempts to force me to surrender my writing to the encyclopedia by every means that I could think of. Except one, of course: a lawsuit for copy-write infringement. 

I'll make you a deal. I'll accept banishment gladly if you will return to me my own writing out of this STUB (!).

It has every right over its membership and followers, until forbidden so by the Holy See, that the Holy See itself over all the Church had when it did publish the index.
Though this has been officially denied, I believe the action of H. Em. Bertone against the Da Vinci Code was not far from censuring, and a quite just censuring too according to what one hears about its content (I actually didn't read it, Michael Crichton is better).
That Nietzsche was not included (I'm not sure about Schopenhauer) has I believe the easy reason that there was no need of clarification that his works are non-Catholic, and so """"on the index"""" by general rule without any need of explicity. Of course theoretically, those books Kant wrote on religion (and that includes the Critic of pure r.) would be implicitly on the index as well because he was not a Catholic, but from the very fact that he did believe in God, the Congregation may have felt the status of his books, from the Catholic point of view, needed further clarification. Also, not every work of Kant was listed.
As to its importance as of now, I agree (as a layman and non-theologian) that reading some of the books today not only does not lead to ecclesiastic penalties (as should be sure) but also is not sinful in itself, as no longer any disobedience to Church law (likewise, of course, as to Card.

Chameleon rapes Michele (because she thinks he's Peter when they """"it"""" on the kitchen floor) a mention of this would be nice. And the fact it was later retconned. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 74.108.143.82 (talk) 

The Chameleon (Dmitri Smerdyakov) is a Marvel Comics supervillain, an enemy of Spider-Man. The Chameleon is a spy and master of disguise. Throughout his history, he has used a variety of traditional, high-tech and biologically enhanced ways to change his appearance, believably imitating almost anyone. He was also the ally, servant, and half-brother of fellow Spider-Man adversary Kraven the Hunter. His name is derived from the characters Dmitri and Smerdyakov from The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

Publication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he initially appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #1 (March 1963), and was the first member of Spider-Man's vast rogues' gallery, based on issue publication date, excluding the burglar who murdered Ben Parker. (Supercharger was the first Spider-Man supervillain chronologically.[1])

Novels The Chameleon had a vital role in the Sinister Six novel series by Adam-Troy Castro, in which the Gentleman, a long-lived supervillain and member of the Machiavelli Club (a gathering of some of the world's most sinister minds, including several non-Marvel characters) uses the new Sinister Six, of which the Chameleon is a member, as pawns in his schemes. Oddly enough, in this series he is referred to as Anatoly Smerdyakov. In the final novel in the series, Secret of the Sinister Six, the Gentleman betrays the villains and tries to escape; it is the Chameleon, to everybody's surprise, who kills the Gentleman, shooting the old man while disguised as a limousine driver and assuming his identity, only to be attacked by Dr. Octopus, thinking him to be the real Gentleman. Marvel has officially stated that the Sinister Six novels lay outside of normal continuity; however, these events have more recently been referenced in the Marvel handbooks. The Chameleon also plays the role of villain in the novel Goblin's Revenge. In this story, the Chameleon not only teams up with the murderous Carnage, but also attempts to drive Spider-Man insane by impersonating Norman Osborn (then thought to be dead and buried), and later trying to expose the web-slinger to a toxic chemical meant to destroy his mind.

Fictional character biography The Chameleon was born a Russian citizen named Dmitri Smerdyakov. In his youth, he was a servant and half-brother to Kraven the Hunter, Sergei Kravinoff, and eventually became a minor associate to one Gustav Fiers. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to him, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff from Smerdyakov. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the United States of America. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth, impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of the Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Kravinoff, now Kraven the Hunter, himself came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate's sights on Spider-Man.[2] Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues' gallery. The Chameleon inspired Kraven the Hunter to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero.[3] With Kraven, the Chameleon then battled Iron Man.[4] Chameleon then confronted the Hulk.[5] The Chameleon stole some paintings from an art exhibit, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.[6] The Chameleon disguised himself as Henry Pym, and robbed Pym's laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine. He delivered the documents and a shrunken Hulk to HYDRA, but was defeated by the real Pym as Ant-Man.[7] The Chameleon disguised himself as the Torpedo and battled Daredevil.[8] The Chameleon later first used his hologram belt to disguise himself to unsuccessfully take revenge on Spider-Man.[9] When Kraven the Hunter committed suicide,[10] the Chameleon became obsessed with making Spider-Man suffer for his failure to prevent Kraven from killing himself. He ingested a serum which made his face permanently featureless and malleable. He attempted to kidnap America's leading expert on supe",0

 Information removed 

I removed the following information that appears to have originated at U2wanderer.org:

Bono supposedly contributes vocals to the track """"Long Black Veil"""" but in a strange twist he is not credited in the album credits.  The information about his involvment comes from various news bits over the years, and mention of this album in discographies published by those who would know, like Niall Stokes.

The lead vocals are by Mick Jagger and The Chieftens.  Originally they were performed by Bono, but were not used.  These had been recorded at Windmill Lane.  Although Bono's vocals were not used, the instrumentals from that session were supposedly used, meaning it may be possible to hear Bono way back in the mix somewhere.

"I think you should differentiate between the mechanism of evolution and the historical evolution. On the one hand not only the basic mechanisms of evolution (variation by mutation, natural selection...), but also the whole mechanism of evolution can be observed. Not nearly as easily as gravity, but it can be observed. (Maybe here the example of antibiotic resistance would be a better, more verifiable example than the fruit flies) Still the mechanism of evolution is only a theory explaining observations which were intuitively called 'evolution'. Those observations are facts (here you got evolution as a fact). The explanation by the mechanisms of evolution is not. It is a theory by definition. On the other hand the theory of historical evolution explaining the variety of species can't be observed, because it is supposed to have happened in the past. You can only observe Fossils and the current flora and fauna. Then you can try to explain how all this came into being; for example by assuming a random abiogenesis of a single cell and then applying the mechanism of evolution. This random abiogenesis and the following evolution over millions of years is what a layman thinks of as 'evolution'. This certainly is 'only' a theory. It isn't and never will be a fact. It is very importent to clearly differentiate these things. Strictly speaking even the assumption that everything always falls downwards cannot be considered a fact. How can you know that there will never be a stone being observed falling upwards?? This may seem a bit like I'm splitting hairs, but if you don't strictly apply well defined terms of 'fact' and 'theory' you will end where we where a few centuries ago considering it a fact that we live on a flat earth. Don't ever hesitate to present things very differentiated! Maybe referencing the critical rationalism by Karl Popper would be a good idea, too.",0

Personally, I don't believe the """"Controversy"""" section is appropriate for this wiki at all.    At best it is a minor matter of interest only to Exetel users, and for the very great majority of them, it was of no consequence at all.

There are wikis in place for several other Australian ISPs, and none of them have more than a description of the company and their services, plus links to some of their subsidiary companies, and some of their services.    I think something similar is appropriate for the Exetel wiki, and that would appear to be what already exists.

Speaking of links, I also think that many of the links which are currently at the bottom of the Exetel wiki are also inappropriate and should be removed, specifically those that point to """"news"""" stories and """"blogs"""", as these have been prioven to be full of inaccuracies, misconceptions, and outright lies.

"""You did a great job on all your maps. I salute you! Speaking of which, would you happen to have a map of Monmouth County with all township boarders? I'm a resident of Marlboro Township. Thanks.

Monmouth County may be the one county with the most number of small incorporated municipalities, and it makes it difficult to show all the legal borders.  The townships could be shown easily, but there are 20 or more small boroughs along the coast that hardly show at all.

 Map data? 

Hi Jim, I saw your recent uploads of Image:Andover boro nj.jpg and Image:Andover twp nj.jpg and I was wondering where the map data came from, and what tools you used to put it together.  I'd like to make similar maps for other areas.  Thanks.  (t) 
The software was Manifold, the data was from multiple sources.  The administrative boundaries and water features were from the Census Bureau's 2004 Tiger/Line (second edition) files for Sussex County, the road network was from the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and the place names and locations were from the USGS Geographic Name Information Service files.  I used information from the Tiger/Line files to identify the divided highways.  The New Jersey state outline was from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics 2004 National Transporation Atlas Databases state boundary file.  
Interesting, but I think Manifold may be out of my price range.  Thanks for your contribtions, these are quite complex maps compiled from several public domain sources, good work.  BTW, is it possible to upload PNG or SVG output from Manifest?  The current JPEGs have compression artifacts, as JPEG was intended for photos, not solid-color-region graphical data.  See Wikipedia:Preparing images for upload.  Thanks.   (t) 

Thanks, I changed all the maps to PNG files.   

 Thanks for the maps! 
Hi Jim, I also appreciated your maps for Sussex County and the ones that seem to be appearing as I type for Passaic County. I have been part of a small group working on Wikiproject New Jersey, a project aimed at filling in the holes and expanding the details regarding New Jersey in all its aspects. While there are portions of the state covered by your maps, and those ChrisRuvolo has created, we could definitely use maps for all of the 566 municipalities in the state (plus the CDPs and unincorporated areas if possible). Any assistance that you could provide in creating and uploading maps, or in providing guidance in their creation, would be most appreciated. We could divvy up the map creation work so that we can ensure that the whole state is covered, and not just by one or two people.  

I think the maps are great, and I see that Warren County is underway. My only question is that on some of the maps, particularly for smaller municipalities (e.g., Belvidere, New Jersey), it can be hard to distinguish between the highlighted municipality and the rest of the county. Is there any way to change the colors to improve the contrast? Other than that, keep up the great work!  

Some of the smallest places do get lost.  The larger red label was an attempt to highlight the principle location on each map, but at the scale of the map, there isn't much to be done for the small places.  I started out mostly interested in showing the township outlines, since most of the online street map servers don't show township outlines.  Once I have a county set up, it is relatively easy to produce an entire set of maps all at the same scale, but it would be much more work to change the scale or colors for individual towns.  Maybe there will be time to revisit the smaller places later on.

Firstly, """"fair use"""" does not mean you can just take whatever copyrighted material you like and use it.  Non-free content cannot be used in cases where a free content equivalent, with an acceptable quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose, is available or could be created.  Lifting a definition from an external source, instead of writing your own, is not an example of fair use.
Secondly, as you seem to think that something can only be redundant if it's an exact copy, let's have a look at the two definitions, piece by piece:
 Wikipedia definition Copied definition Comparison A tax (from the Latin taxo; """"rate"""") is a financial charge or other levy According to Black's Law Dictionary, a tax is a """"pecuniary burden Equivalent in meaningimposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity)laid upon individuals or property owners Equivalent in meaningby a state or the functional equivalent of a stateto support the government [...] a payment exacted by legislative authority.""""  Equivalent in meaningsuch that failure to pay is punishable by law.It """"is not a voluntary payment or donation, but an enforced contribution, exacted pursuant to legislative authority""""  Equivalent in meaningTaxes are also imposed by many administrative divisions. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent.and is """"any contribution imposed by government [...] whether under the name of toll, tribute, tallage, gabel, impost, duty, custom, excise, subsidy, aid, supply, or other name."""" Oooh!  Slightly different.  And how very useful a list of obscure alternative words for """"tax"""" is too.
If you really, desperately need to include the list of obscure alternative words for """"tax"""", the way to do it is to list some of the terms, and cite the source from which they came.  Simple, huh?  The way not to do it is to copy and paste the entire chunk of text verbatim.

RfC: The Correct Name Of The Video Game (Independent Of The Article's Title)

Foreword: as the section's title indicates, this matter is completely irrelevant to the title of this Wikipedia article.

The concern right now involves the correct title of this video game. One position is C: The Contra Adventure, the other is simply The Contra Adventure. The latter is supported only by the assumption that the large """"C"""" in the game's packaging case and manual is nothing more than a """"logogram"""" and not part of the actual name.

There is weighted evidence that supports the notion that the official name of this video game is C: The Contra Adventure. Here is a sample of reputable sources, out of a pool of several:

http://ca.ign.com/articles/1998/09/17/c-the-contra-adventure

http://klustr.net/contra/games/
https://contrapedia.wordpress.com/c-the-contra-adventure/

Further, the other games in the Contra series have a similar design to the name on their packaging:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Hard_Corps
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Legacy_of_War
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Shattered_Soldier
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Corps:_Uprising

They are universally and unanimously accepted as having the colon and the text that precedes it in the official title.

The strongest evidence that supports the title of C: The Contra Adventure is present directly in the video game's instruction manual, on several pages:

This foolish movie depicts Persians completely wrong, it's actually on the verge of racism. The first Persian it shows is African American,  Persians are caucasian, decendents of the Aryans.  Persians have white skin and hair ranging from black to blond, my father is Persian and he's blond hair/Green eyed.  The second Persian shown is obviously, Arabic, which is even further insulting for myself and other Persians to watch. 

Another obvious misconception is, during the beginning of the movie the African American messanger, playing a persian, makes an insult about the female being in a position of power.  Persians were of the Zoastrian religion, which saw men and women equally.  Persia made use of the first female warriors, and it was the first civilization to put women in power.

WP:AN3#User:Geoeg reported by User:dicklyon (Result: Both blocked for 6 hours) dicklyon and Geoeg have been disagreeing about an article where WP:COI is a concern. Since dicklyon reported Geoeg for 3RR, he/she is focusing negative attention on Geoeg. Why is this not harassment?
WP:AN/I#SPA Milto LOL pia pointed out a concern about a WP:SPA editor, also focusing negative attention on them. Why is this not harassment?
WP:COIN#SPAs and socks pushing POV, PR, and advertising on the Chapman_University_School_of_Law Page This also focuses negative attention, not totally unlike what I said Justanother has done. Why is this not harassment?

You seem to buy into Bishonen's belief that I am out to get Justanother and thereby assume anything I bring up must be part of that campaign. You are wrong, in this case he was being disruptive while other editors were genuinely trying to resolve a dispute. If this isn't being disruptive, all that needs to be done is give a brief explanation why answers like this are acceptable:
Q:Using reliable sources, should this article have a section discussing Hubbard's personality?  
A:Rephrase:' Should a one-sided, POV analysis of Hubbard's """"personality"""" based on a small number of critical sources and bordering on WP:OR synthesis be posted in the article as a """"work in progress"""" or should a balanced, NPOV, and non-OR piece be developed in a sandbox by interested parties from all sides of the issue. Which one benefits the project? There, that is a more accurate statement of the issue.  

Please put your assumptions about what you think I'm doing and ask yourself if the arbcom meant to give Justanother a free pass from having to abide by any rules that I happen to point out? For crying out loud by your logic I couldn't report ANY violation of policy by him whether it's valid or not. Does that really make sense to you?  """,0

Peacock words

WP:PEACOCK lays it out pretty clearly, and specifically mentions """"famous"""" as a word to avoid.  But people seem to wish to use this word, in one particular place only, in this article.  The logic behind avoiding the word is very clear: it's subjective, and described what people might think about something rather than any objective fact about it.  What is """"famous"""" to you is not """"famous"""" to me, and vice versa.  So either we liberally add the word throughout every article, to describe anything that could be considered by anyone to be """"famous"""", or we don't use it at all, unless it was used in a quote or other trivial exceptions.  It was decided a long, long time ago that the latter option would be better, and this was written down in the manual of style.

""""musicologist Joseph Kerman called it"""" is objective, concise, and verifiable.  """"musicologist Joseph Kerman famously called it"""" contains no additional information, only puffery.

The fact that there don't appear to be any, of course!!! For the sake of the argument, let me outline why I consider the story to be incredible (though not necessarily false). 1. Why were his parents permitted to have sex? 2. Why was he not aborted like other babies? 3. Why was he kept alive? Children are not cost-effective as slaves in the early years. 4. Why was he kept in the camp when he could have been transferred to an """"orphanage""""?  5. If he was dishonest about his mother's death, how can his honesty on anything else be assumed? 6. How could they afford to maintain an electric fence when they couldn't afford to feed border guards? 7. Why was a military uniform a """"passport"""" to travel through the country, when military service is compulsory? What did Shin do when questioned about his unit or purpose given his ignorance of the DPRK? 8. How was Shin able to trade, travel, survive, and escape better than the average North Korean given his ignorance? 9. Why would a hungry border guard let him through in exchange for food and cigarettes, when the guard could capture him, pocket the food and cigarettes, and gain a reward for capturing a traitor and prison escapee? 10. Given the long and largely unguarded border, why would he need to deal with a guard at all? 11. Finally, given that, by his own admission, he has next to no experience of North Korea, outside bizarre prison experience, how can it be established that he has ever been to North Korea, and is not an ethnic Korean from China?
I am sure that the book makes an attempt to explain some of these issues, but this is circular logic. Such an incredible story, would not be accepted so readily if it did not concern North Korea.  For various reasons, there are special """"DPRK Rules"""" which cause most people to suspend their critical judgement when assessing negative stories about the country. I fail to see why I, who unapologetically do not suspend my critical judgement, am subject to the onus of proof.  I rest my case.  21:48, 14 May""",0

Elen, thank you for proving my point.  Meant seriously in saying so.  And no, I am not finished.

1, if Wikipedia is not a publisher of THE TRUTH (TM), it cannot then call itself an encyclopedia (Pillar #1).  It can, at best, and using your own definition here, Elen, be a publicly-accepted repository of publicly-accepted """"facts"""" accepted by the public.  I said that three times to make a point.  The repository is only made by publicly-accepted parties, the facts are also only those the collective shall accept, and the amount of verification is similar.

I point to the Wrestlemania XXVIII dispute.  This user has decided to use wikia-level """"evidence"""", but, since the public has accepted his stand, I am not allowed to challenge it.  And he's lying on top of it!  And if that, and other places I've attempted to edit, are any indication, this kind of conduct probably goes on all over the site!

The problem with the """"sports organization"""" (the BCS case) is that if that organization has removed the valid sanction of an event, then it creates an inconsistency between verifiability and damnatio memoriae.  If Wikipedia fancies itself an encyclopedia, then, it grants a sanction which no longer exists  in fact, it basically grants a status of """"fact"""" to something now ruled complete fiction due to the misconduct of one of the teams involved!  (And solely because the public accepts it.)  The problem comes in that Wikipedia, as an encyclopedia (and I will call this site on that again and again), grants a statement of """"fact"""" on something which is now fiction, because the public has decided that the event, since it physically took place, cannot be reversed, even if all evidence points to the fact that it should've been.

(And, yes, I will find the same farcical situation in many sports articles.)

And if I must find a """"published fact"""" for something, then personal knowledge becomes irrelevant to the process.  (The Final Fantasy case.)  If we are not going to trust the general public to do research (WP:OR), how do we trust the general public not to manipulate the """"published facts"""" (which see Mania XXVIII)?  Personally, speaking generally, I don't trust most members of the public (far beyond Wikipedia) to spell """"CAT"""" if they are spotted the """"C"""" and the """"A"""".  How am I going to trust them with a public repository of the """"facts"""" when they get to determine what is """"fact"""" and who gets to post it?  (Throwing out Pillar #2)

Ah, needs to be something the lawyer has signed.  I assert that hasn't happened in Cena-Rock, myself.  (One of my (ignored) claims was that the level of """"promo"""" of that match is the same as the level of promo in the Daniel Bryan intended-cash-in!)

And in stating """"These are some of our rules"""", you openly abdicate Pillar #5 by your own statement.  The choice is yours, not mine, because the public apparently gets to determine everything in Wikipedia as I said above.  How can I carry on an intelligent and informed conversation with someone like ChristianandJericho, who basically does not know proper English and chooses to type like a 12 year-old girl into a cellphone?  He probably doesn't even understand what I'm saying to him, frankly!  And how can I come to a consensus with a group of people like-minded to that?

At minimum, it's going to take a TBAN on pro wrestling and at least two IBANs on the two other users, for starters.  I can probably come up with at least a PBAN on a celebrity for a prosecuted 1998 criminal threat on top of it without even taking initial action on the page!    """,0

"Huh? 

I didn't change the nature of the article and wrote the sidenote because it is apparent that though many people edit thsi article, very few of those editors have spent much time with Biff, drunk, or sober. I have. I know what he's like, and he's not nice, to women especially. I think it's important that no matter what happens here, it happens with some kind of consensus. What I'm seeing is gross abuse on each side of the story. You and Willmcw are no better than Jonah and his many aliases- which for the record i find offensive. Furthermore, your quote on my talk page is erroneous. You don't know exactly who I am. I came to this place to write about things near and dear to me. The Biff Rose edits have generateda little bit of notoreity with those that know him, as i'm sure you are aware. Biff is largely responsible for that. he likes to spread his fame. 

I've noticed on the pages and pages and pages of talk about Biff that you've been every bit as antagonistic and as the Jonah Ayer/ Steve espinola ones. You seem to try and trap them into bad behavior. But you do it in such a manner that is inappropriate here on wikipedia. mind oyu, I've not been on here for as long as you have, guessing from the timetable of your postings. I can say this, by being so incredibly hardheaded about Biff, you end up becoming less of a standard bearer for the moral right side of the street, and seem akin to whom you accuse. Willmcw believes your point of view, and you his, and that's unfortunately created a definition of biff that even hhe himself must be getting a hoot from. 

You don't know me. Maybe you've been to the same bar where I once worked, maybe you even ordered a drink from me, maybe I chatted you up. But that certainly doesn't give you the right to claim knowledge of me. I think that's offensive, as offensive as Jonah Ayers or whoever he is claiming that Biff was a child molester. I'm a nice person and I think that's what happens with Biff. He finds nice people to glom up to, and eventually the true nature of his personality comes to the front, and it's not such a clearly angelic personality as I'm sure you've seen if you ever had to spend any amount of time with him at all, when he was drinking. he was a paying customer at two bars I worked at, and so I had to stomach some rather base and quite frankly aberrantly sexist remarks from him, on a regular basis. It was people like him that helpeed me decide that it was time to leave the city of New Orleans. Another one was Barry Cowsill, who sadly has gone missing since Katrina hit. Barry however had an excuse; he was diagnosed as Bi polar, and when he was off his meds and drinking, there was nothing he could do to mend his behavior. Biff had no medical diagnosis to alter my opinion of him. The cases are similar because both men experienced some minor amount of notoreity due to their musical prowess, and were not able to channel that into permanent success like many of their contemporaries, lesser talents who had much better managers or agents. Southern Louisiana is peppered with what are known as almost weres and has beens. Sugarboy Crawford, whose song Iko Iko you might know, stopped performing after a steel plate was implanted in his head after a brutal beating at the hands of white police officers. James Booker, one of the most noted pianists to play in the New Orleans style died on a hospital gurney after getting himself to Charity Hospital in the middle of over  dosing on heroin, only to be left ot his own devices for six hours, in which time he died. The thing is, those men were not only major influences on the culture of their time and place, but on further generations after they were no longer playing. Both  Barry and Biff may well have influenced others, but never to the degree of the other two men I mentioned. That doesn't make them lesser artists, just less influential. Not one of the four of them had very big sales at any point of their careers. However when I got the chance to meet Sugarboy Crawford, he was kind and courteous. And he stayed that way, no matter how many times he nipped from the bottle wrapped in brown paper in his hip pocket. 

I lived in the New Orleans because I got an academic scholarship to Tulane. I worked in the french quarter bars because I discovered that was where the real money was to be made in New Orleans. Did you know that? I don't think so. I went out amongst the musicians because I loved the openness that most of them showed, and that Biff seemed to have at first. I found that most of them had experienced some degree of shell shock from having worked in the confines of the recording industry, and yet still seemed to be wonderstruck. Again, Biff fit right in; again, at first. But I found that many more of them continued to develop their skills, and work in the industry or on the fringe of it, because music was in their blood.

Thanks for your helpful comments. I would suggest one of my own for you: use proper capitalization and punctuation when making comments on Wikipedia.
You are correct, I would not argue that """"the widespread possesion (sp) and use of guns is FOREIGN to puerto rican (sp) culture"""" - but I also would NOT argue that it is common in """"American"""" culture - by any definition of """"American"""" culture. (What do you mean by """"American"""" culture? a culture shared by all nations of the Western Hemisphere? that shared by the USA, including its insular territories? that shared by the mainland USA alone?) I have never possessed or used a gun, nor do I personally know anyone who has. Thus I should be culturally identical to my fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, in this regard. I'm not sure what you are trying to suggest with this example, but it is straightforward to claim that the English language is a part of the culture of the United States, because its use is pervasive throughout the country; but it is something altogether different to suggest that the possession and use of firearms is a part of the U.S. cultural identity - there is wide variation in attitudes toward this supposed """"cultural trait"""" from person to person, from region to region, and yes, from state or territory to state or territory.

This is specifically about the protest movement at the time of the Afghanistan invasion (and was more exclusively so in earlier versions, because someone has now inserted """"and Iraq"""" in the next sentence). You say there was no anti-Afganistan-invasion-movement worth mentioning. Don't know where you were. I was in London at the time. 50,000 of us were in Trafalgar Square, that's usually considered a large enough protest to be worth mentioning. I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   | Talk 07:16, Jan 4,""",0

My point is that objective or not, fair or not, truthful or not, this mediation imho will not solve the issue.

Note that if you visit their website http://www.always-thinking.com/ and click on the 'our work' tab you'll find that Activision is a client.
The advertising company is located in the same City / State as ActivisionValue (Although that may be purely coincidence).
Two games that this company did advertising work for were both published by Activision Value. 'Pimp My Ride' and 'World Series of Poker'.

anyway, i also found that the research was indeed valid. For more info here> http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143
The analysis was performed using 749 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) informative for European substructure (selected from a genome-wide panel of more than 5700 SNPs). 749 polymorphisms are more than the triple polymorphisms needed to make a valid human genes' research.

Oppose merger.  The Mesopotamia article could do with some expansion in several sections, while the History of Ancient Mesopotamia article could as well, but mainly, would suffer greatly if downsized.  A merger makes no sense, based on article size.  Wikipedia has is fair share History of articles.  I can't see a reason to get rid of it.  *shrug*  
Oppose merger. Articles that try to cover too much become long and overly complicated to read. Basically I like the Mesopotamia article. Although it could benefit from some expansion and clarification, it is a good summary article.   
the point is that as the ToC was organized, the 'history' article is the """"main"""" article of about 90% of this article. That doesn't make sense. Maybe change """"history"""" to """"timeline"""", and make this one the """"ancient Mesopotamia"""" article.  (ᛏ) 
You are probably right. I am just learning about Mesopotamia through reading these articles and I found this article the most helpful (to me) of the ones I have come across so far. I have not read all of them but some are almost incomprehensible to an uninformed person.   

 Map 

We need a better map for this article. The current one doesn't even include Eridu.  
Eridu is seven miles from Ur. There is only so much detail you can cram into a thumbnail overview map. But you are welcome to fire up the GIMP, of course.  (ᛏ) 

A map of Mesopotamia with the current political boundaries would be beneficial in giving people a better understanding of its location.

 Law examples 

On this page (under """"Laws"""") there were about 30 examples of laws from the Code of Hammurabi. I have moved them to the article Code of Hammurabi, since I think that is their proper place. I really think that article should contain the entire set of laws (since it is not so big), and I will probably make an effort to do this (but not right now). If someone else feel the urge, it would be greatly appreciated. The entire set can be found here:

 Enlil 

Under the section on Mesopotamian gods, it is stated that Enlil is the most important god in the Mesopotamian region. I believe that statement is somewhat misleading. To my knowledge, over the thousands of years of Mesopotamian history, that honor changed hands quite a few times depending on what particular group held power. It should either be qualified or changed; if I have some time later, I will try to come up with a more constructive suggestion for changing it, but for now I wanted to pose it to discussion group to make sure I wasn't just splitting hairs. Any thoughts?  

 Games

Someone had gone into that page and injected the phrase, """"SUKI (tm) is fake"""", without signing the comment, and without appending the comment in an appropriate place.  I reverted such edit on the basis that it was innappropriately added, and not on the basis of content.

Instead it operates on an anachronistic rule-based paradigm that wobbles to what the most dominant Wikipedia editors believe.  When it comes to characterizing living persons, that paradigm is demonstrably fraught with errors that are nigh impossible to fix.

There are famous cases in history when the vast majority of people held laughable misconceptions.  But science is an arduous process, and many dedicated scientists have suffered grievously for having the temerity to displace a popular misconception with a superior theory grounded in evidence and reasoning.

To say that they approached the topic with skepticism is to imply that they literally considered the possibility that this truly was a time traveler. That itself is a POV.

This is the first article I nominate to GA-review, please tell me if I miss anything. walk victor falk talk 

What about those taken prisoner by the British/Allies in the Middle East. Also those who refused to join the Free French in Britain and were repatriated back to France.?   
I respect this point, but we're talking about close on two million people in prisoner of war camps in Germany. That's what the scholarship covers and it's that which is covered by reliable sources establishing notability. Everything else, a tiny fraction by comparison, is generally only mentioned as a footnote to a general history of the campaign. Yes, French soldiers were probably taken prisoner from Indochina to Britain, North Africa to the Middle East. But they pale into insignificance when compared with the 2 million in Germany and this is why all the titles on the bibliography talk about French prisoners but only deal with the German-held ones. So I see your point, but I can't really do anything about it. It just isn't out there. '  
  Yesterday I was editing Free_France#Syria_and_East_Africa, and as it mentioned how only 5000 out of 40000 chose to join Free France while the rest wanted to be rapatriated, my immediate spontaneous/instinctive reaction was to wish for something like [[French WWII POWs#Vichy prisoners]] to target in this article. However, as  notes, some probably existed but their numbers are vanishlingly small and the result of special circumstances, such as beeing spies, obvious traitors & collaborators and suchlike that does not fall in what is considered a POW by international conventions; For the allies, rank and file Vichy troops were always offered a choice of repatriation, no questions asked, and their incarceration as POWs always a temporary affair.  I can think that more conventional perhaps such existed as Axis and especially Japanese ones after the coup in March 1945 eliminated any fiction of Vichy rule in Indochina, but sources about that might be very elusive to find; and anyway, probably more within the scope of the """"POWs held by the Japanese"""" wikipedia article. At the most, a short sentence summarising the above might be added somewhere, to dispell the same curiosity from readers that you've shown. walk victor falk talk

""":Clayc, that's not a list of evolutionary biologists who dispute evolution, nor of ones who dispute it for scientific (as opposed to religious) reasons; according to the website you provided, it's a list of """"Creationists holding DOCTORATES IN SCIENCE"""". Are you arguing that was should mention that a number of scientists dissent from evolution in the lead section of Evolution because creationists aren't banned from getting doctorates? That's rather silly indeed.
Creationism is a personal religious belief; it has nothing to do with science. There is no scientific evidence for creationism, and no aspect of creationism has never been supported or verified in any paper submitted to a peer-reviewed scientific paper. The problem here isn't that you're trying to dispute evolution by linking to a Christian website (after all, Christians can do science too); rather, it's that you're trying to dispute evolution by citing people who hold a certain religious belief. Creationism has no more relevance to the field of biology than Mormonism or Hinduism or Trinitarianism does. It is scientifically (and biologically) unremarkable that some people reject scientific facts for religious reasons, and creationism is a religious movement, based on the Book of Genesis in the Bible, not on scientific observations. If you think that the Book of Genesis (or any religious movement based on it) is science, you gravely misunderstand the meaning of """"science"""".
Also, that's an amazingly short list, considering how many millions of people there are with doctorates.. And how many people on that list are actually biologists?
Also, a """"criticisms"""" section is a bad idea, though a related article is currently under construction: Objections to evolution. When it's finished, it should satisfy your desire that this encyclopedic topic be covered. It's not a scientific topic, however, but a social and historical one, so it will have little mention in the top-level article, Evolution. -

 All this argument crap. 

In my opinion, 
a) Notability is established in this article in the fact that One Bid is a qualifying game played 6 times a show, every show, 5 days a week, on a highly rated network game show, and has been an element of every version of the show since the original. It would be ideal to have some other citations to show it's been recognized outside of the show itself, but I believe sufficient notability has been met, and the tag needn't be there.

b) Original research. If you are read the tag, it says """"See talk page for details."""" If you are not going to either tag with  or start a talk page section explaining what you believe is original research (or be more specific by tagging only the relevant sections), then I don't believe the tag should stand

c) I think this article does need more citations. I think almost every article on wikipedia needs more citations than are currently there. However, since there isn't even a single  tag on the article, I don't see what specific information is felt to be requiring citation. As I understand it, Wikipedia practice allows primary sources (in this case, the show itself) to act as a source for anything relevant to rules and how the game is played and what happens. So if there are major uncorroborated facts in the article, you ought to tag them specifically to justify a refimprove banner tag

d) The merge discussion seems to have been abandonned. I believe it should be appropriately revived and an actual pro/con vote be taken, or else abandon the merge tag. I see no evidence of support from the discussion linked to in the tag.

This is my opinion as to how the tags should be dealt with. It is not sufficient to just say """"original research exists in this article so I'm going to slap a tag at the top."""" (for example). These tags should be supported by specific explainations or pointers to actual problematic content unless the entire article really needs citing or is original research, which I don't find to be the case here.

I would just like to point something out.  As a long practicing Wiccan, I was incredibly offended by the remarks of the obviously Christian person several posts above who makes the claim that witchcraft comes from the devil.  One of the most basic rules to Wicca is """"to give evil a name is to give it power"""".  Therefore, true Wiccans do not believe in a devil or a hell that bad people are sent to.  To explain the idea of afterlife that we believe in would take up quite a bit of space, and I am not trying to sway anyone to my beliefs.  I respect all religions and all people, and I do have an open mind to new people and beliefs.  However, my mind is not so open that my brain is going to fall out.  I have been persecuted for my unorthodox beliefs, losing friends over it because I did not want to convert to their religion.  Eshmasesh, I agree with you completely, however, there is not a set number of deities to worship in modern Wicca.  The God and the Goddess are very important, but there is also the All (or Spirit).  Worshipping nature is a common facet of many Wiccan branches in modern times, as is the belief that true balance can only be achieved by nature.  As for the multiple deities, Wicca is a polytheistic religion, and there are many branches to choose from.  In branches such as Khemetic (Egyptian Wicca) and Alexandrian (Greek) Wicca, you can devote an entire ritual to one specific God, like Aphrodite or Horus, or encompass several.  The choice is entirely up to the worshipper.  I know that there are teenagers who dress in all black and lots of jewelry and proclaim themselves to be witches, but they are nothing of the sort.  This is not saying that witches don't dress in black and wear jewelry, some may.  But Wicca as a religion, not a fad, requires hard work and dedication.  I look forward to the day that Wicca and all Pagan religions are as widely accepted as Christianity, but I am not holding my breath.  I just ask that Christians try to practice open-mindedness as much as they preach it.  The world would be a better place if more people were open-minded.

Conflation of the two """"brook"""" homonyms

that crosses between two other bodies of water. This may be US usage but it certainly is not of the UK. (thus """"brooking"""" them) The stream brook derives from Anglo-Saxon broc. The acceptance verb derives from AS brucan. There seems to be little connection. Also the Scottish term for a creek. It is not particularly Scottish. And has to do with creek only in the US usage. ( 08:43, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC))

 RJP was correct that the two brook homonyms were being conflated.  AHD4 says that brook the transitive verb (""""To put up with; tolerate"""") comes from Middle English brouken, from Old English brūcan, """"to use, enjoy"""". (BTW, that's interesting, because today's German verb brauchen can mean """"to use"""". Clearly cognate.)

 Meanwhile, brook the noun (""""stream"""") is a homonymous word coming from a different root, via Middle English, from Old English brōc.

  

Section was missing

is part of the article missing?  the last section is empty.  
thalweg says """"see below"""" but there is nothing there. [alex]

Changes to the article
I propose that the """"Types of water streams"""" section be changed. I have been unable to corroborate the brook definition given. The definition I found most often is a stream smaller in size than a creek. It is also used when the water source is a spring or seep. When """"stream"""" is not used in the generic sense, I've found various definitions. Some have it as being the smallest of all and some have it as just below a river. I guess we can continue only giving the generic definition.   

Better image was wanted

I feel that the first image, of a """"running stream,"""" is not very accurate, given we see water still enough for duckweed to accumulate in large amounts.  I don't doubt that it could be a flowing system, but it is hardly what I picture when I close my eyes and think """"running stream.""""  Nitpicky, yes.  

Looking at the current version of the article, this appears to have been fixed.  

 Categories suggestions 
Suggestion:  Make a category about Daylighting (streams) for neighborhoods (plese see article also—the list is already getting long), sections # Some neighborhoods with daylighting projects and # Other places.  A child article or something will eventually need be spun off.

Since each daylighted stream exists only as an intimate component of the neighborhoods of the watershed, linking the streams and neighborhoods in a category could be very useful.  Various daylighting projects exist all over the world, though so far we have Seattle, San Francisco, and Berkeley.  There exist similar projects restoring natural areas in urban settings, distinct from parks.  One is Union Bay Natural Area, another is a marsh north of San Francisco or in northern California (Eureka?) that is also providing habitat and tertiary sewage treatment, rather than having been drained.  (The most-recognized level is conventional secondary treatment.)

Suggestion:  Make a category of natural areas in urban settings.  This is tangentially related to the Georgia Basin Ecosystem Initiative at Salish Sea.

Comments, discussion?  How to tie into existing, relevant articles?

The Daylighting (streams) article could use more diverse examples

 

Stream is limited to Southern England?
I'm sorry, but the quote 'Stream is limited to Southern England,' in reference to the word 'stream' itself is total nonsense.Only the broadest of Yorkshiremen, for example, use only the word 'beck.' I am not adversed to words like these being mentioned in the stream article, but can people please try to avoid making such sweeping statements about them?

 Idea for Talmud articles 

Hi Avraham: I am reposting the following request from User  on my user talk page for wider notification:

I was thinking of trying to stimulate development of a series of articles on Gemara concepts and doctrines, maybe to help children or newcomers to Gemara with explanations of some fundamental concepts that recur throughout the Gemara. Some examples might be articles on Yiush, Chazakah, Ta'aninun (as in """"Ta'aninun L'Yoresh""""), Eidim Zomemin (forgive my awful transliterations), Migu, etc., etc. Maybe we could even create a category or subcategory for it. I created Breira in this vein. As I don't have the experience or expertise in Wikipedia to know what to do to best develop this idea, I figured I'd come to you for your opinions on: (1) whether it's a good idea; and (2) How to best go about implementing it. Thanks

The only extent to which I haven't has been me trying to do exactly the same """"Step back and take a deep breath"""" since Monday thing that you're now arguing I should do.

It all depends on what you call free energy and what you call suppression. IMHO there are so many different free energy machines it's just hilarious. Knowing that makes the reason for suppressing them down all to obvious. If some one is getting stalked then you just take their word for it.

The main criticism of the theory is that these devices are absent in the market because they do not and cannot work. 

Here the excuse to ignore it is the ignorance it self. The tool of suppression is the argument the devices don't exist, but this is also the excuse for never looking at them at the same time. We cant have it both ways? Either the machines don't work or the theory is wrong. We cant assume the machines must work because the theory has to be wrong just like we cant assume the theory must be right because the machines cant work. Most people will continue not believing it's real even after being confronted with such device. They will stand there screaming about the laws of thermodynamics. People like the inventors twin brother, or their wife. Not very likely to convince a wikipedian if you cant convince your wife now it is? The suppression is not so much executed by special interest groups as by the mainstream dogma. The dogma is however much supported by the special interests.

Signs of real professional free energy suppression you can see here on wikipedia. Every actor in history is worthy of his own page but weird inventions not confirmed by mainstream science (working or not is irrelevant) apparently cant have a page here. The few free energy machines still having their own wikipedia page are full of rant how crackpots try to destroy the laws of thermodynamics and how nutterish they are, not your usual trolling but the work of experts. Take the introduction of the Water fuel cell. """"the source of this addition energy has not been scientifically identified therefore the theory is treated with skepticism."""" There was barely any theory, it just worked! And it has not been investigated. The way it's treated is not worthy of being in the description. An encyclopedia should not instruct it's readers behaviour? Tell me how to treat things huh? """"such a practice conforms to the parameters of perpetual motion, hence conclusive scientific investigation would either verify violation of thermodynamic law or identify the source of claimed additional energy."""" But if there isn't going to be any scientific analysis - ever! then the laws of thermodynamics are nonsense. If the best scientists can do is preach the laws then it's just not very likely they are right about the topic. Then it says: """"At least one car prototype, reportedly powered by a water fuel cell, has been assembled."""" HUH what? but but but?? You know what I mean? """"Meyer's claims about the Water Fuel Cell and the car that it powered were found to be fraudulent by an Ohio court in 1996."""" His wiki use to say 
http://web.archive.org/web/20050106215257/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Meyer
""""It failed to work during a required demonstration of the water-fueled car. An Ohio court found Stanley Meyer guilty of fraud in a case brought against him by disgruntled investors."""" So he was scammed by his own investors. What kind of person would do that with a known to work invention? And why was this important information deleted? Then it says: Stanley Meyer was granted patents in the United States and abroad starting in 1989. The verifiability, and scientific basis, of the patents are controversial. Now I know the water motor patents where granted after a working model was displayed. You can see it in the application number. There is no other way to get a patent on an electrolysis cell. Because of those laws of thermodynamics you know? You do know about those right? You can see free energy suppression live at work when you see that the world famous American inventor Stanley Meyer was not worthy of his own wikipedia page. It's obvious he cant have a page because that would violate conservation of energy right? Paul Pantone does have his own page where again the working of his device is denied by no-witness, The GEET page however describes a Hindi film? BTW Paul was also scammed by his investors? ha-ha? Yull Brown is also not worthy of his own page? Makes it kind of hard to write about free energy suppression when the suppressed and murdered inventors are not allowed the light of day? What about William A. Rhodes? Dennis klein then? no? Isaac de Rivaz? Daniel Dingle? etc etc?? At least we still have the Oxyhydrogen page right? haha? This is how free energy suppression is done.

I wasn't sure if the """"get out of the way"""" was directed specifically at me and my Bush edits or if you were just speaking figuratively.  If it was directed at me I hope you realize I'm only trying to improve this article by expanding on the introduction while still keeping it concise.  

The reason I listed those other topics is because the current intro only talks about the War on Terror.  While that's most likely the biggest part of Bush's presidency, it's not the only thing that happened.  I wanted to inform readers of other things that have gone on during Bush's time as president.  If I were to elaborate on all of that, it would make the intro ridiculously long.  So I thought to list them and figured if anyone is interested they can check the rest of the article where those topics are all addressed in more detail.

 imho, activity diagrams are one of the diagrams provided by the UML which is an OMG standard, not related to Utrecht university definition, though it may seem similar on the surface. But there are many variants of these diagrams (e.g. workflow diagrams, workflow nets and even some dialects of Business process modeling are graphically similar) the definition given here is not 'activity diagrams' which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of OMG. So, moving the text to Process-data diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. Or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models, and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as I initially suggested (hmm, took out my hatchet and did it!). I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page. But I think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. The merge was suggested as a way of providing an example """"provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling"""".

When I saw the edits and MPLX's addition yesterday, I found it rather anti-GWB (which I happen to share, but...) POV and unfounded. The connection seems absurdly weak and tenuous; for decades if not centuries politicians all the world over have been speaking of peace while waging or preparing war, and assuring the populace that it is a just war to bring a better tomorrow for everybody (in my country, we have rich experience with """"fighting for peace"""").
So, first of all, I don't think the speech was particularly paradoxical, let alone """"[[Orwellian]"""" - although I don't follow the US media; if MLPX can provide links of other commentators noting this, he has a case in point.
Secondly, even if the speech was meant to explicitly refer to FDR's Four Freedoms, I think that the mediated connection to 1984 is too loose and willed for an encyclopedia.
Thirdly and most importantly, even if the section had a place in the article, it's certainly not squat in the middle of the section """"The World of 1984"""".

Fair use rationale for Image:PEIFL_logo.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:PEIFL_logo.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

Wikipedia is not the place to publish original research.  Wikipedia will only give a """"balanced view"""" if such a view can be supported with citations from published literature, preferably peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Equally important, Wikipedia is a reference encyclopedia that has an obligation to note that this hypothesis is not currently accepted by any mainstream, reputable medical organization (CCHR doesn't count, as they are neither reputable nor are they a medical organization).  

Perhaps, instead of attempting to convince the Wikipedia audience as to the veracity of these claims, you would be better off attempting to publish research and convince scientists and researchers of the validity of these claims using evidence.  You mention that you are a psychologist.  I do not know about psychologists across the pond, but in the US, the American Psychological Association, the specialty society that represents and speaks for American psychologists, has been quite clear in stating their support for the mainstream view that ADHD represents a serious neurological behavioral problem.  The American Psychological Association has also not endorsed this Social Construct hypothesis, and many of their statements contradict this hypothesis.

In fact, the APA even has a page set up specifically for ADHD:
http://www.apa.org/topics/topicadhd.html

Now, as I mentioned, I am not as familiar with practice in the UK, but I did manage to find the NICE clinical practice guidelines for ADHD.  They can be found here:
http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG72FullGuideline.pdf

In any event, the problem has nothing to do with anyone being """"wedded"""" to any notion, but rather that the proponents of this hypothesis have published very little research and have so far failed to convince the vast majority of researchers in their field as to the merits of their proposal.  First must come the research, the evidence, independently verifiable information that can be cited to support the hypothesis.  That must come first, before you can expect to see any sort of """"balanced view.""""""",0

(bah, a bit long, but you get my drift.) (Trouble is, if you want it in the infobox, you'll probably want a longish caption to make the analytic significance transparent.

 Pope Francis article: quote from Jerusalem Post editorial 

Hi, Herzen!  Wanted to make sure you saw that I reverted an edit you made on the Pope Francis article, asking that the issue be discussed on the talk page. I did change the sentence you had deleted to reflect the fact that it came from an editorial (not an """"article"""") in the Jerusalem Post. Sorry for my mistake!!! (Guess it was my sloppy thinking, just categorizing """"editorials"""" and """"news articles"""" as different types of """"articles"""".)  However, I think it's a really wonderful quote, only positive. The Jerusalem Post is a highly respected paper representing the views of an important segment of the Jewish community: those who live in Israel.  If we talk about relations between this pope and the Jewish community, I think it's great to have a quote from a paper like that, basically saying that this pope has been in a place that gave him a chance to have a rich relationship with the Jewish community  perhaps richer than any previous pope. Anyway, I think it's a very good quote in a section that addresses the pope's prior relationship with the Jewish community. I hope you'll reconsider your objection.

Page 96 of that document contains the following:

The scheme was designed by Sir Murdoch MacDonald, M. Inst. C.E., Adviser to the Egyptian Ministry of Public Works.  He also exercised control over the carrying out of the work until his retirement from the Egyptian Government Service in 1921.
The consulting engineers were the late Sir A. L. Webb, M. Inst. C.E., from 1914 until his death in 1921, and Messrs. Coode, Fitzmaurice, Wilson, and Mitchell, from 1922 to the present date.
Colonel L. N. Cooper, M. Inst. C.E., was appointed resident engineer in 1914, followed by Mr. E. W. Buckley from 1914 to 1917. The Author has held that office from 1917 to the present date.
The contractors from 1919 to 1922 were the Sudan Construction  Company (Messrs. E. Alessandrini and G. S. Perry, M. Inst. C.E.).  From 1922 to the completion Messrs. S. Pearson and Son,  Ltd., carried out the work. Their director in charge was Sir Frederick T. Hopkinson, M. Inst. CE., the agent in charge being Mr. J. W. Gibson.
The sub-contractors for the supply and erection of the sluice steelwork were Messrs. Ransomes and Rapier, Ltd., of Ipswich, their engineer in charge being Mr. J. R. Russell.

On this basis I propose to amend the entry accordingly.

You can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified, that's really not my concern here, since it's a dead letter.  I'm concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal.  If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, it's not the first time.  Look at Issei Sagawa.  Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted, and that guilty people will be acquited, from time to time.  That's the price you pay for having a legal system; in the end someone has to make the decision, and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right.

"Excellent, , Quondum, and , though I think in the redirect a slightly larger discussion of the advantages of using tau would be helpful in understanding why anyone could have thought of a seemingly unorthodox mathematical proposal. The redirect already has the advantages of the notation of a turn in terms of tau (like a half revolution would be tau/2), but I believe a small discussion on the advantages on the sine function (like in this old Vi Hart video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7vhMMXagQ) would very much strengthen the argument. It doesn't have to be large. Or maybe that could appear on the sine page.",0

 Whoops. Nice job, kiddo. 

You said, one some poor guy's talk page:

I hope you will use this block time to consider a few matters that could make you a better editor, should you decide to continue. First, Wikipedia editors aren't nearly as stupid as you think they are. We include many people with advanced degrees who work in scholarly professions. Many of us can see through the kind of lies that you tried to use better than we can see through glass. Secondly, disruptive editing, lying, and attempts to sabotage the system not only get you into trouble, they also defeat the very goals that you are trying to achieve. If MattyBraps is deleted, one of the major reasons (but certainly not the only reason) is your behavior as creator of the article. You did serious damage to your own efforts to keep the article on Wikipedia. And finally, take some time to read Wikipedia policies. Start with WP:5P, and every time you see a blue link, click it and read what you see. If you can do these things, you might stand a chance of becoming a good editor. Otherwise, you need to move on to somewhere else to spend your time. Think about it.   

I would contend that Wikipedia editors are, in fact, as stupid as I suspect, as you still fail to grasp that the BT guy and I (the IP user you believe he sockpuppeted) are not the same person. All it took was me mirroring the way he types, pretending to be angry, and claiming """"I made the [Mattybraps] page,"""" and boom, I got him blocked. Thanks for helping me settle a bet about whether or not I could get the creator of the Mattyb wikipedia page (it's an embarrassment that it exists) banned inside of a week. I too have an advanced degree  turns out nobody gives a shit, champ. Keep up the excellent work. 75.64.190.21

Fourth Examination, 17th December, 1455. [Additional statements.] 
The sum of a thousand pounds, or crowns, was given by the King of England for the surrender of the Maid; and an annuity of 300 pounds to the soldier of the Duke of Burgundy who had captured her. 

I was appointed notary in the Trial, together with a certain Guillaume Boisguillaume. 

The copy of the Process was shown to me is the true Copy made. I acknowledge my own and my companion's signatures, and that it is the truth. Two other copies were made. One was given to the Inquisitor, one to the King of England, and one to the Bishop of Beauvais. This Process was made from a certain Minute written in French, by my own hand, which was given up to the Judges, and was afterwards translated from the French into Latin by Monsieur Thomas de Courcelles and myself, in the form in which it now stands, as well and as faithfully as possible, long after the death and execution of Jeanne. As for the Act of Accusation and other parts of the Process, Maitre Thomas de Courcelles had very little to do with these, nor did he greatly interfere with them. 

With regard to the word Nota, written above certain Articles in the Minute, there was, on the first day of the Inquiry, a great tumult in the Chapel of the Castle at Rouen, where, that day, the interrogation was held, so that Jeanne was interrupted at almost every word, while she was speaking of her apparitions: Certain secretaries were there-two or three-of the King of England, who registered, as they chose, her words and depositions, omitting all her defense and all which tended to exonerate her. I complained of this, saying it was irregular, and that I would not be responsible, as clerk, in this matter: and, therefore, on the morrow, the place of meeting was changed and convened in a certain hall of the Castle, near the Great Hall, while two English were placed to keep order. When there were difficulties as to Jeanne's answers, and some said she had not replied as I had written, I wrote Nota at the top, in order that the questions might be repeated and the difficulties removed. Although it is mentioned in the Process that the Judges stated they had received preliminary evidence, I do not remember to have seen or heard of it; but I know that, if it had been produced, it would have been inserted in the Process. 

Jeanne was brought to Rouen and not to Paris, because, as I think, the King of England and the principal people of his Council were there. 

At the beginning of the Process, I was sent for to attend a meeting held at a certain house near the Castle, at which were present the Bishop of Beauvais, the Abbe' of Fecamp, Maitre Nicolas Loyseleur, and many others. The Bishop told me it was necessary that I should serve the King: that they meant to bring a fine case against this said Jeanne, and that I was to recommend another greffier to assist me. I therefore nominated Boisguillaume. 

I met Lohier in the Church, on the day after the Bishop had asked him to give an opinion on the Process, and inquired what he you ght of it. He replied, that the Process was of no value, and could not be maintained, because it was conducted in the Castle and not in a legal court; that it concerned many who were not summoned; that Jeanne had no Counsel: and for many other reasons. He added that, in his opinion, it was their intention to put her to death. 

A certain Maitre Nicolas de Houppeville was summoned to attend the Trial; and was in great danger, because he refused. Maitre Jean Lemaitre, Sub-Inquisitor, delayed as long as possible his attendance at the Trial, and was much vexed at being compelled to attend. 

One day, when Jeanne was being questioned, Jean de Chatillon spoke in her favor, saying that she was not compelled to reply to the question put to her, or to that effect. This much displeased the Bishop of Beauvais and his following, and there was a great tumult at his words. The Bishop ordered him to be quiet, and to let the Judges speak. 

On another occasion, when some one was advising and directing Jeanne on the question of submission to the Church, the Bishop said, """"Hold your tongue, in the devil's name!"""" I do not remember the name of him who was thus spoken to. 

One day, some one, whose name I do not remember, having spoken of Jeanne in a way which did not please the Earl of Stafford, the latter followed him, sword in hand, to some place of sanctuary; and, if they had not told Stafford that that place was sacred, he would have slain him. 

Those who seemed to me most affected [against Jeanne] were Beaupere, Midi, and de Touraine. 

One day, I went with the Bishop of Beauvais and the Earl of Warwick to the prison where Jeanne was, and we found her in irons. It was said that at night she was fastened with iron chains; but I did not see her so fas",0

Update re: """"public domain"""" in the United States
Some parting comments re: the two images; for those still seeking to document the licenses that reference """"public domain"""" in Poland and/or in the United States, one might want to take a look at the """"Photo credits"""" in the PBS (U.S. public television) documentary Website for its series Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State (2005); about a week ago I edited the article on the BBC program to include the source citations for the PBS broadcast of the same program (with diff. title).
(cont.) Today, while searching """"images of Auschwitz prisoners public domain"""" out of residual curiosity re: this matter, I located one photo credit referring to """"public domain"""" in the U.S.-published Website for the BBC program shown on PBS: it is a photo credit for """"Auschwitz prisoners"""" (not Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum/Wilhelm Brasse photographs, but photographs taken contemporaneously at Auschwitz in period from 1940 to 1945, depicting prisoners outside on the grounds of the camp at a barbed wire fence, e.g.: see Credits, scroll down to """"Auschwitz prisoners"""", and go to page 1 (hyperlinked) to see the photographs.  If PBS is citing """"public domain"""" in the United States, this might be a helpful precedent to cite re: Auschwitz photographs (taken by Polish photographers w/o copyright credits being given?).  Just a thought.
(cont.) I do not expect to be editing Wikipedia much if at all in the near future, so I thought I'd leave others with this possible publication precedent in the U.S. for citing U.S. (and possiblly worldwide) """"public domain"""" re: photographs of Auschwitz prisoners; though I am not sure it applies in the UK or European Union too; that would not matter if it applies in the U.S.
(cont.) The so-called duplicate photograph (3 poses) of Kwoka in the Wik. Commons file of same name is not exactly the same; it would be a good idea to rename the Wikipedia version as asked in the template to reduce possibility of deletion; the one in Wik. Commons still has the Museum captions in it and by virtue of that is possibly not in the public domain.  The cropped one w/o the Museum captions has a stronger argument for """"public domain"""" in the U.S.  (The one that is more clearly a photograph of the Museum-captioned photograph has a weaker argument as such, though I am not sure of that.  See the various discussions of the two images linked via the templates.) It is important to correct the conflict/problem pointed out via the templates of the duplicate names for images that have conflicting licenses/fair use rationales in Wik. and Wik. Commons.  If the images are determined by the reviews to be public domain in the U.S., they do not need fair-use rationales; they can be files in Wikipedia Commons (w/o Museum captions/the cropped version currently in this article) and not duplications w/ same name in Wikipedia (??).

"""

 Navigational template 

All the other topics have such things. So if there is a """"X and violence"""" article, there is usually a """"criticism of X"""" navigational template. As a sidebar, it does seems a bit pov-ish and non-WP:TOPIC since articles are often in a """"see also"""" type category rather than relating to the article at hand.   

That's my problem with them also. I think we should really get rid of all the criticism sidebars, all except for the the literary, film, etc, ones since criticism in those circles doesn't usually equate to 'very biassed'. It's almost as bad as putting articles on Christian violence under Wikiproject atheism (or vice versa, though I can't see it happening). When I see articles tagged that way I don't need to see anything else to know that somebody or other has a POV to grind and that the article is likely a mess.
  

 Teehan and Dostoevsky 

So the problem here is that we are mixing contemporary academics with great thinkers and writers and also putting Dostoevsky after Teehan when Dostoevsky clearly predated Teehan.  At the core of the problem is the fact that the question of whether Christianity is violent goes back further than Dostoevsky.  Thus, if we are going to use sources that are not from the last half of the 20th century, then we should frame the whole question as a much older debate involving philosophical perspectives such as Dostoevski's.
Note that I am not objecting to including Dostoevski; I'm just saying that we need to put him up against other great thinkers of a similar stature.  I'm thinking that there must be Enlightenment thinkers who would be good representatives of the critical side.

That is a good point about John Locke (I do know who he is, he's even taught in our local middle school, just by the way, haha), he was very influential, but he was a philosopher, not a theologian. Many church goers, whether self-identifying Christians or not, and many self-identifying Christians, whether church-goers or not, do not believe in original sin. I have no idea how many, or what kind of proportion that would be out of the total populations of their respective groups. However, original sin is a biblical doctrine. Babies going to hell because they were not baptised, however, is not. The Bible is not very specific about that issue. It is a Catholic doctrine, yes, but we need to keep doctrines voiced by all of Christianity and parts of Christianity distinct in this article. The Protestant stance is that babies, both born and unborn, whatever they do, are not held accountable until the age of accountability, or the age of reason, at which point they know the difference between right and wrong. Roman Catholicism also holds this idea, so I'm wondering now how babies could go to hell when they can not be held accountable for sin? They have their inherited sinful nature (original sin), sure, but that's different from actually committing a sin. Is the official Roman Catholic stance then that all people are born destined for Hell, whether or not they've actually lived long enough TO sin and thus separate themselves from God and so choose eternal death over eternal life? Honest question here, I'm not trying to bash the Catholic Church.

 Some things to note about Stalin 

1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.

2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.

3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by """"kind ol' Uncle Joe"""" babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a """"dictator"""" per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.

4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?

5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution:

 """"At the close of the twentieth century, """"Canadian"""" has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group, up from 0.5 percent in 1986 to nearly 4 percent in 1991 and to 31 percent in the 1996 census of Canada.

We find that most of the increases between 1986 and 1991 in """"Canadian"""" ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in British origin responses. Between 1991 and 1996, increasing Canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the British and French ethnic origin counts.

Thanks for your message on my talk page. When I voted keep for Tom G. Palmer, I justified it by writing that """"Google returns 13500 hits for the query """"Tom G. Palmer"""" cato [3]."""" """"Tom G. Palmer"""" alone returns 34,900 hits on Google [4]. So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000).
Well, sure, but that's weak""""35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't"""". Come on. That's not serious.

But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.
Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

I can certainly handle that ) I was thinking of your """"stress"""" talk/post from a while back, I also pretty much quit editing after some highly fatiguing moments last year (in which I eventually prevailed through arbitration); on pages where you'd never have expected arguments! I am bilingual and binational in Canada, which makes my cultural sensitivities and awareness a little over the top. Add arrogant Frenchmen into the mix and it makes editing French pages extremely litigious and the same vein as certain brit/american/auz litigations on language use. Some days I think that each language wikipedia needs to invent a country/region specific tool because endless regionalisms in a single intro is heavy. Another source of litigation is overuse of internet references, often these pop culture science sites are rife with distorted or misinformation, for internet references I like to limit it to webpages which are themselves well referenced or science organizations vs virtual non contactable entities (of course, as an overeducated scientist, mostly I mean in context of scientific notions) or media pages (I distrust these most).

Instead you write """"I think the misunderstanding is that PBS assumes that the word patriot has only positive connotations."""" Whether at the time people use the term patriot to mean a supported of the Good Old Cause or something else, its usage today implies someone who supports their nation, and if it is to be used before the UDI, then what does it mean as (the nation did not exist)?
@ your argument """"The British colonists had made North America their country"""" is I think flawed unless you think that Virginians somehow changed from being patriots to rebels between the 1770s and the 1860s. Surly in both cases they were either rebels or patriots, unless one is using the terms inconsistently. If they were rebels in the 1860 then why not use the term for the 1770s as well? Luckily one can usually substitute the word """"Confederate"""" for """"rebel"""" so this is not usually a POV issue for civil war articles (but using the word patriot in an article has POV connotations). For example in the main body of the text the first use of the term Patriot is in the sentence """"The landing of this tea was resisted in all the colonies and, when the royal governor of Massachusetts refused to send back the tea ships in Boston, Patriot mobs destroyed the tea chests"""". In what way were the mobs patriotic? Even the phrase """"rebellious mobs"""" would not be accurate. """"anti-tax mobs"""" would be more accurate, but it is probably better just to drop the adjective completely from in front of mobs.

The Real World: Miami BLP issue
If the anonymous IP editor was indeed the cast member of that show in person, then they should've contacted me, or anyone on Wikipedia to address this matter in an open, transparent manner. By instead removing the material which was sourced to the very network on which that show aired, and making no attempt to respond my messages on the IP's talk page, that person left me with little choice; I acted in good faith, and my actions were completely legitimate. Many times when photographing public events for WP and the Commons, I have happily aided BLP subjects who have requested my help in addressing problems with their articles. This includes contacting Community Liaison Maggie Dennis, and Jimmy Wales himself, most recent regarding the Toure matter, for example. But if the person removes sourced material from an IP account and makes no efforts to respond to my messages, my hands are tied. In your view, I should just assume that when an IP editor removes sourced content, that oh, I should assume that it's the actual subject, which is silly. Equally silly is your position that MTV is """"flimsy"""", when the article in question is about a show on MTV, and the source is the bio pages about cast members on their website.

"""::::That's an interpretation. And state and nation are inseparable under the Spanish constitution (1978) that only accepts the term nation for Spain. 
Wanting to keep Spain united is legitimate but, specially as this is done via denying the right of self-determination for minority nations such as the Basque one, it clearly is Spanish nationalism.
Part of the problem may be that """"nationalist"""" in Spanish has not the negative connotation that may have in English. Instead """"patriotic"""" does have a negative connotation in Spanish that doesn't seem to have in English. They are sort of inverted in their shades. But basically they mean the same thing after all. 
Nationalism is after all the ideology that supports the ambitions of certain nation (nation-state, stateless nation...), often at the expense of others. It's not very different from patriotism actually but somehow people seem to feel differently about these terms and the feelings are opposed in English and Spanish. In Spanish """"patria"""" (fatherland), """"patriota"""" and """"patriótico"""" are part of the language of the Army, which is inherently associated to Francoism and other many military coups. Franco and his partisans abused these terms mercilessly, so Basque nationalists almost never call themselves """"patriotas"""" in Spanish, even if that's the literal translation of """"abertzale"""" but """"nationalists"""". On the other hand Spanish nationalists (PP, PSOE, some minor parties) don't use either term normally but talk about the unity of Spain and not being nationalist (in the sense of stateless nations' patriots). 
Also, back to the PSOE, they have a somewhat confuse discourse but, outside of Catalonia, they are clearly centralists. Navarrese PSN is as anti-Basque as UPN (PP). Western Basque PSE-EE is, despite its incorporation of the acronym EE, at most very limitedly regionalist. 
Under PSOE governments transference of attributions as per the Gernika statute were frozen almost totally most of the time. Their discourse may be somewhat confuse but they are clearly against Basque self-determination and self-rule beyond what is almost unavoidable to keep some appearence of social peace. They are not as extremist or inflexible as PP maybe but that only makes them moderate Spanish nationalists, but Spanish nationalists anyhow. 
PSOE is also strongly in the Jacobinist tradition that all pan-French parties have. Yet the reality of Spain doesn't fit so well with those centralist premises and therefore an unstable arrangement had to be made. It was nevertheless more impelled by the extinct UCD of Suárez than by the PSOE itself. And it's understood by most that the coup of 1981 was a whistle blow, with the complicity of PSOE, against """"excessive"""" decentralization that Suárez seemed willing to concede. 
Whatever the case, the term """"unionist"""" seems to avoid all this problematic and is a good English term. I really can't find anything better. My POV is """"Spanish nationalist"""" as more precise term, """"unionist"""" is for me a linguistic compromise and also a step towards NPOV.

"Translation

Being exposed to the two traditions, I am unable to decide which one covers best the definition.How we define freedom itself depends upon various factors - culture, education, environment and individuals own understanding on where the voluntary freedom ends and the legal begins.However, let us see how the French definition reads into English.I admit, this falls beyond my area of specialisation and could possibly be literal in places

Freedom is the sense of acting according to one's own will without being restrained by the power of anyone else.It is defined 

negatively as  the absence from submission,servitude,constraint exercised by someone else.

positively as: the autonomy and spontaniety of a rational being;the voluntary human behaviours are based on freedom and qualified as Free

This notion is seen as an abstract and normative value of the human actions and at the same time like a solid reality.These two perspectives are interwoven in many ways and could lead to errors of categorisation.There are, therefore, numerous confusions that can arise with respect to the term Freedom.So,it is necessary to distinguish the different sense of this word.

The Freedom could be taken as an attribute of the Human Being, of his will and be the condition of natural and positive rights, but also his duties;the effective realisation of the voluntary acts has a dimension that could not be possible without the later.These two ideas of Human existence are not necessarily compatible.For example, the existence of Legal Freedoms can be felt, while its reality (existence in our acts) and its essence (its conception that we have) poses problems.  

The first point could be addressed in a Socio-Political research; the second point constitutes its metaphysical base and particularly the Philosophical understanding of Freedom.This article is divided into two parts to facilitate this understanding.The first part covers the Philosophical aspects - treating the metaphysical notions of Freedom and the second part - the Sociological aspects.However one should keep in mind that the two aspects are interrelated.

Well, my name at GameSpot is The_Capitalist, and if this topic ever opens, I'll rewrite the topic. Is anyone planning to contact a Wikipedia mod? 

Um, go to the protected list and say it should be unlocked. Often the sysops just forget if no-one demands it! So do that and it'll no doubt become open very soon. Talk 5 July 2005 04:19 (UTC)

I went to the list of protected pages, but GameSpot wasn't listed. I believe that they thought they had re-opened the page, but I guess they did not. I've alerted a wikimod to the situation. - XX55XX/The Capitalist  

The protection logs said it was protected against vandalism. Since it has been protected for almost a full month, I have unprotected it. Next time, ask for unprotection on Wikipedia:Requests for page protection.  5 July 2005 21:54 (UTC)

""""GameSpot is credited with being one of the most reliable and sometimes brutally honest resources for gaming information in the Internet, leading in reviews, previews, and news coverage""""
Any sources for this? 

Read some reviews, the people at Gamespot are pretty tough. 

Anyone I know regards them as the opposite, according the gamerankings they are purely average.  

That's purely anecdotal evidence, which is useless. Go pick up a game box sometime. The developers love quoting positive reviews from Gamespot and IGN  

While it may be POV, me and everybody I know certainly believes it to be true.  

I actually don't see as many gamers trumpeting Gamespot's reviews on thier boxes as you would have us believe. I believe your opinion is just that.

I agree, it should be reworded as 'Many people see gamespot as the most brutally honest... etc... etc.. etc..', this article is full of POV information, a definite rewrite should be in order. Besides, it doesn't matter if you've been a member of GameSpot since ever, or if you even work there; the writing standards of Wikipedia still apply.

I have listed this article at WP:DRV for possible undeletion based on information I have received regarding a book that has been written by Trehin about his fictional city, Urville.  Interested parties should contribute to the discussion.  

Is this still deserving of featured article status?

I'm beginning to think that this article should be removed from the list of featured articles.  It seems to me that political ideas and attempts to be politically correct have compromised the factual veracity of this article.  This should be a pretty straightforward article about a neurological disorder like epilepsy or aphasia.  Instead, it reads as if Asperger syndrome is either some kind of blessing or lifestyle choice and that there are negligible drawbacks to having it.  The very fact that many of the participants on the talk page take issue or offense at even calling AS a disorder or disease when it is viewed as such by the medical community is rather telling.  I really think the mainstream medical and scientific view should be emphasized, as medicine and science strive to have the neutral point of view that this article lacks.  I'm not looking for an argument.  I'm simply warning those interested that if this article stays as it is I will probably lobby to have it removed as a featured article.",0

"Teeth 
I see you want the teeth section better explained.

The idea is that tetrapods that grows slowly (i.e reptiles) continue to grow in maturity. Both the steadily increasing size of the jaws and the wear and tear imposed by a long life dictate continued change of teeth. Mammalian teeth being complex, replacing teeth requires quite a bit of resources, and as anyone having children of pre-school age can attest to, it is also a lot of bother (try eating an apple without your front teeth!). Thus, for the fast-living, high energy demanding life of insectivorous mammals, tooth replacement is kept to an minimum (i.e two setts, a trait retained in their descendants). How do you propose going about explaining it without making it a disproportionally large part of the article? Or is it so important it should be a large part?",0

The """"makes sense"""" part then yields to Occam's razor, the conspiracy theory would have to be that the US choose to loose standing and face international criticism over invading Iraq and finding no WMD's AND pass up the opportunity to declare war on Iraq for a WMD attack OR the anthrax was NOT weaponized by Iraq, as it was coated and prepared differently than the Iraqi anthrax weaponization program did, but prepared in a way researched and used in past US programs.

The high level of musical proficiency is often combined with a lyrical counterpart in the form of epic textual concepts, resulting in lengthy songs and concept albums.

No one asked women if they wanted the vote - it was the Suffragettes who put the proposal on the table.

Derby police were aware of rumours of a paedophile gang operating in the city.[1] On 30 December 2008, Staffordshire police stopped a car on suspicion of shoplifting, carrying three gang members and three young girls.[3] The girls had been reported missing from a care home in Derby.[3] The police drove the girls back to Derby, and during the journey, they told the officers about what had been taking place.[1] Derbyshire police force launched an undercover investigation called Operation Retriever, setting up surveillance and tailing the gang's BMW around Derby.[1] Detectives collected DNA samples from several of the crime scenes.[5] Siddique was wearing an electronic tag after a previous conviction for assaulting a woman.[1]

On 24 April 2009, two distressed teenagers stumbled out of a flat that was under surveillance and said that they had been raped.[3] The police had been unaware of their presence. The victims told the police of other girls who had been assaulted, and the police soon discovered a campaign of systematic grooming and abuse within the city. Detective Inspector of Derbyshire police, Shaun Dawson, said, """"When we arrested them, we had no idea of the scale of this. Once we had them locked up other victims spoke out and it snowballed from there.""""[1] Debbie Platt, who led the police investigation, said she was shocked at the extent of the abuse and said it was like """"a campaign of rape against children.""""[3] The police stated that the abuse could have continued for a lot longer.[1]

I'll start with the line """"Derby police were aware of rumours of a paedophile gang operating in the city."""" - which simply implies the past. I believe that there needs to be clarity of time frames - otherwise it can be taken to mean that there has always been some paedophile gang operating in the city since the dawn of time!

The more I think about it, the more I think """"we"""" is the right wording. The problem is that the object of the sentence is """"Penn"""" and without knowing that he said, """"they"""" you're expecting him to use a first person singular, not a first person plural. I think the reason it feels awkward is that when it undergoes the transformation from singular to plural it does become slightly more ambiguous, because """"we"""" refers to a group of people, but only one that includes Penn, which means it's either Penn & Teller or the entire production staff of the show. When you go to """"they"""", it could be any group of people, and because it doesn't say """"he"""", you sort of need to think about what other possible groups Penn could be referring to. Obviously it only takes a few milliseconds to figure out what it means, but if you're reading along at full speed it can break the flow to have that happen.

Regarding the colon wording (Penn said: """"the aim of the show is to ..""""), I understand what  is going for there, but I don't like the way it sounds in that paragraph. When you do it that way, it seems like a non-sequitur. When you have it the other way, it's clear that we, the editors of the encyclopedia, are trying to convey to the readers what the aim of the show is, and we're using Penn's words. When you just say that Penn said something, and the thing that he said is about the aim of the show, the role of that sentence in the paragraph becomes a bit more ambiguous, because it could be that we are trying to convey that this is how Penn thinks about the show, or that we're trying to convey something about Penn himself. I think the way it's written now and where the quote starts removes nearly all that ambiguity. But of course, I could be reading into things way too much. I think it feels natural with the """"we"""" being included in the quote, but maybe  has a better compromise wording that addresses my concerns about non-sequitur.  [talk/contrib] """,0

The category """"Noahide Religions"""" is extreemly misleading Rambam doesn't say Muslims are Noahide just not idolworshipers.A Noahide (Ben Noah, Chasid Umot haOilam) according to Rambam and others is someone who officialy accepts the 7 Laws and observes them.According to letters of the Rambam Islam is herecy, a false religion started by a false prophet:
Mohammed the False Prophet - Islam the False Religion

Rivka Olenick 

""""A prophet will the Lord, thy God raise unto thee, a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren."""" Deuteronomy 18:15 
The false prophet, the navi sheker, the """"madman"""" Mohammed, as the Rambam calls him, convinced his followers of Islam that there are several verses in our scriptures that allude to his being a prophet. The Rambam states: """"These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them believe in them or entertain any illusion about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. The Muslims themselves put no faith in their arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so falicious."""" 
Mohammed claimed that Deuteronomy 18:15 specifically refers to him. He said that it was he who God arose as """"a prophet from the midst of thee."""" Of course, he himself nor anyone else ever found one word in the scriptures that proved that Mohammed arose as a prophet. Yet, he and his blind followers accuse us of manipulating the text of the Torah. They ignorantly claim that we purposely removed every trace of the name of Mohammed from it. However it was they that would not accept the main precepts of the Torah, out of defiance to the Revelation at Sinai. So in great desperation they created a book that horrendously warps and taints our scriptures and undermines Moses as the greatest Prophet. After all this they attempted to legitimize the Koran as a book of truth. 
Isn't it amazing that exactly what they accuse us of - """"altering"""" the Torah text - is exactly what they altered when they made up this """"imitation"""" and called it the Koran. What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: """"Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us."""" There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain."""" He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise. 
The Torah states that the prophet that will arrive """"from the midst of thee"""" is a person that will keep the Torah in tact as it was given to us by Moses from God. The Ninth Principle of our Thirteen Principles of Faith states: """"I believe with perfect faith that the Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be another Torah given by God."""" As it says: """"Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it."""" Deuteronomy 13:1. 
""""A prophet will the Lord thy God raise unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren."""" Islam took this sentence completely out of context and made inferences. All the statements before and after must be understood so that the meaning and purpose of the statements is known. The sentence quoted above was taken from a paragraph in Deuteronomy that specifically warns the Jewish people about the prohibitions of soothsaying, astrology, divination, sorcery, etc. The Gentiles believe they can manipulate and use these practices in ord",0

How come there is no criticism of Newton's theory of gravitation on the page?  Afraid of criticism and dissent?  Is Wikipedia afraid of Neutral Points of View or not?

""""Einstein’s theory of gravity is the craziest explanation of the phenomenon imaginable.""""  Wallace Thornhill, physicist, 2001

""""Leibniz held that the Newtonian universe was imperfect because it occasionally requires God to intervene to prevent it from running down.""""  William E. Burns, historian, 2001

""""Leibniz also attacked Newtonian physical ideas, including absolute space and time, [and] the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which he charged introduced an occult force....""""  William E. Burns, historian, 2001

""""Like Huygens, Leibniz never accepted Newtonian gravitation.""""  Ezio Vailati, philosopher, 1997

""""Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians.""""  John M. Keynes, economist, 1936

""""An atom differs from the solar system by the fact that it is not gravitation that makes the electrons go round the nucleus, but electricity.""""  Bertrand Russell, physicist/philosopher, 1924

""""...what is really wanted for a truly Natural Philosophy is a supplement to Newtonian mechanics, expressed in terms of the medium which he suspected and sought after but could not attain, and introducing the additional facts, chiefly electrical—especially the fact of variable inertia—discovered since his time…""""  Oliver J. Lodge, physicst, February 1921

""""Magnetism is possessed by the whole mass of the earth and universe of heavenly bodies, and is an essence of known demonstration and laws. By adopting it we have the advantage over the gravity theory by the use of the polar relation to magnetism. A magnetic north pole presented to a magnetic south pole, or a south pole to a north pole, attracts, while a north pole to another north pole or a south pole to another repels. This gives to us a better reason than gravitation can for the elliptical orbit of the planets instead of the circular.

Don't worry, it was just a typo with brackets omitted (a frequent case with the longer sentences or those involving a few disparate concepts.

To define it as """"negative"""" would be as absurd to define Soviet Communism, the most murderous regime on earth as """"negative"""" or """"positive"""". Those Croats and Bosnian Muslims who volunteered to take part in the Ustaška vojnica-more than 40.000 people in 1943.-cannot be labelled as war criminals, nor as traitors, as anti-Croat propaganda would have it in the Communist Yugoslavia period. The pathological murderers like Maks Luburić or totalitarian dictators like Ante Pavelić cannot cast the shadow on all the participants in the Ustaša military forces, any more than Joseph Mengele or Adolf Hitler can contaminate the memory of German soldiers, particularly Waffen SS who fought in the WW2. This is even more true about ordinary people or intellectuals who participated in the NDH regime (for instance, Adolfo Bratoljub Klaić, the author of famous dictionary of foreign words, or the sculptor Augustinčić, who made a bust of Pavelić, but later switched sides. Do I have to repeat ? The NDH was a quisling state. The vast majority of people involved with it and working for it were neither quislings nor criminals. And, this is just the NDH talk. Let's not forget that, as far as resistance movement goes, the Croats were the majority both in leadership and in fighting forces who were not forced to   join the resistance (like the Serbs in the NDH), but did it out of ideals. And, in the percentage of participation, heavily outnumbering other nations in ex-Yugoslavia-except, pehaps, Montenegrins: http://www.hercegbosna.org/engleski/ww2.html Hmmm...I haven't seen anything that would refute the claim that Serbian propagandists are vandalizing not a few wikipedia pages, solely with the aim of spreading anti-Croat chauvinist hatred.

You are presupposing that Asparagaceae (or perhaps """"Asparagaceae"""") is defined under the ICN. The code, however, claims merely to regulate nomenclature, providing definitions only of words like """"cultivar"""" (in Appendix VII), words that do not name taxa. Even if you can produce a reliable source for your claim that names are defined in terms of a type and a rank (a claim that is also made in the lead), you have a problem with neutrality; Monsch (2003), for example, argues that names do not have definitions. The ICN entries, on this view, only fix the reference of names, while a definition—if one were possible—would provide the meaning. The meaning/reference distinction is much discussed in recent philosophy.   16:23, 24""",0

Update: The Oreskes abstracts

 

Naomi Oreskes claims to have analysed 928 abstracts she found listed on the ISI Web of Knowledge database (1993 – 2003) using the keywords """"global climate change."""" However, this claim is incorrect: while the ISI database includes a total of 929 documents for the period in question, it lists only 905 abstracts. It is thus impossible that Oreskes analysed 928 abstracts.

 

In my original critique, I used the same ISI database and the same key words as Oreskes but used all documents listed therein. While Oreskes did not specify the method she applied in her study, she later confirmed that she had limited her search to “articles”, while I included “all document types” in my initial assessment. This difference appears to explain the discrepancy between the “928” abstracts Oreskes claims to have analysed and the 1117 documents I found and considered, although her figures don’t add up, one way or another.

 

Some commentators have argued that these differences undermine my main criticism while they validate Oreskes' claim. However, as I have stressed repeatedly, Oreskes entire argument is flawed as the whole ISI data set includes just 13 abstracts (less than 2%) that explicitly endorse what she has called the 'consensus view.'

 

In fact, the vast majority of abstracts do not mention anthropogenic climate change.

 

I have posted all documents and abstracts listed in the ISI database under the key words “global climate change” (for the period 1993 – 2003) below, arranged by year. Check for yourself! Make sure you differentiate between implicit and explicit endorsement of the IPCC consensus (“[M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations."""")

  The BLPN thread begins with this from you
After reverting an addition of a name of a living person to this article based on doubtful reasoning and subsequently the name being re-added, I am concerned about the basis of the whole article. There is an assumption that someone who is alleged to have had sex with a """"novice"""" or """"student"""" or """"disciple"""" (without unambiguous definitions of these terms) is fair game to be listed in this article as a """"sex abuse case"""". Some of the names listed have had no legal proceedings taken against them, others have been reported as having reached out of court settlements without the case being proven. There are obvious issues with the name of the article, the selection criteria for names being added and confusion about how well such cases need to be sourced. Fæ (talk) 
 However you spin it, it was you who initiated this process and you did not extend me the courtesy of informing me. I did not revert any deletion of yours in your account name unless it was an IP deletion or from another account and for each reversion I made I noted in the edit summary that I had referred to it  on the talk page and there gave my reasons and asked for dialogue.
 If I had seen your concerns I would have noted first of all that unambiguous definition of terms is not common in discourses and in any case I began the article with a clear description of what was meant by  'abuse' in the context of the article. Even in the drafting of legislation where great care is taken to be unambiguous there is nevertheless a need to leave some terms undefined: for example 'nation' in EU leglislation, 'indecent' in UK criminal legislation (in the context of child protection) - the examples are legion. In any case it is perfectly well understood what abusive sexual behaviour amounts to and abusive behaviour need not be criminal. In particular teacher-student sexual relationships are universally regarded as abusive on the part of the teacher. The selection criteria was mentioned in the article - that the individuals involved had founded Buddhist groups at the forefront of the emerging Western Buddhist movement.

"DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN.
The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief.
Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran.
There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD! 

Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.

Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.

Perhaps the problem can be best summarized by your own comment on this page when you said that you thought about the issue and came to agree with the rest of the group. In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance, your actions were shameful. When faced with a group of people who reached consensus, you still had the audacity to have the page locked to reflect your (poorly reasoned) point of view. These are the actions of a stubborn child who wants his way and completely contradictory to what Wikipedia is about.

"""==Passion Killing in Namibia==
Introduction

In the Cambridge Advance Learner’s Dictionary, passion is defined as a very powerful feeling, for example of sexual attraction, love, hate, anger or other emotions and killing is defined as the act of murder. In this context Passion Killing is combined.Passion Killing can be defined as the act of killing someone out of the feeling of extreme anger, love, hate or other emotions.

In the past passion killing in Namibia was very minimal but now the number has gone up and it has become a trend. Recently, a large number of continuous Passion killing cases have been reported. So far it is only men that have been reported to have murdered women, breakups and infidelities being 2 of the main reasons amongst many.In this article I’m going to contemplate and discuss the causes of this aggravated passion killing in our society, who is at fault and recommendations as to what can be done to stop this type of violence.

The causes
The question on everyone’s lips is, “why are men killing women?”

 Amongst many causes, the most popular causes of passion killing reported have usually followed from women who depend on men for financial support, for things such as accommodation, tuition fees in a case of a student, food, clothes and other essential basic needs and in this case, men tend to become possessive and feel they own the women and when women call it quits, the men usually feels betrayed and sour and end up killing the women.The Namibian, 2012Namibian

 Another major cause that leads to Passion killing in our society is infidelity from women. When a woman cheats and the men finds out, the feeling of betrayal usually overpowers the man and they end up killing.

 A possible cause could be the lack of self control and lack of respect towards women.Causes

Who is at fault?
As I have observed, both men and women are to be blamed in different cases.

Firstly, certain men are at fault are because they don’t seem to understand the real meaning of love. """"The country should cry out for help. True love is patient, love is kind - it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.. Bishop Kleopas Dumeni, 2012 

Even if love is not involved, as it is in some cases, one would often feel that their ego is bruised or that their money has gone down the drain because they felt they had invested in something that they can own as property.In other cases men tend to become desperate for love and affection and end up offering material things and money to women to get some sort of affection even though the women have not demanded for it, In the end they feel they own the women and when they cheat or end the relationship they result to killing. 

Women are at fault in cases such as when they do not work hard to be independent and they accept all this material things because they want a chance at a luxurious and easy life at little to no cost. But little do they know that they might up paying with their lives when they do not stick to the person who is supplying with them with this sort of life. 

Women or both men and women are also at fault because they enter or initiate relationships for the wrong reasons, be it for money or sex and soon and in the end the differences start to surface, then there are misunderstandings and pain to one or both parties. 
Either way there are many different cases regarding passion killing and in  different cases either sexes are at fault but this still does not justify passion killing.

Recommendations
Recommendations 
The solution to this problem is a hard one to solve because it would require some sort of reaching out to the people of this Nation. Knowing the diversity of people, it’s hard to figure out what would impact certain people.  Never –the –less, the nation cannot sit back and watch this type of evil carry on. Informante
A number of people have come up with reinforcing the death penalty. But I believe one cannot fix another evil with evil.""""So what is the exact answer to the problem, should we bring back the death penalty? Will it stop the passion killings?",0

The fruit page mentions plants only. However, there is another example of a fruit. 

When a fungus grows to the point that it can produce spores, the portion of the fungus that contains the spores, or fungus seeds, is considered the fruiting body of the fungus.

Currently, the fruit page only gives information about plants being fruits but even the fungus Wikipedia article states that the mushroom is the fruiting body of a fungus. I hope someone can confirm the validity of my claim.

 charge of unethical conduct 
Jc37, at my talk page you wrote:
 ...Concerning ongoing disruption regarding the DRV of Erdros numbers. If you continue to disrupt Wikipedia, you may be blocked until the DRV discussion is closed. -  ...
I take it that your opinion is that I am (to some significant extent) disrupting Wikipedia. These points:

 Does the ongoing ANI (I haven't checked it yet) regarding canvassing, pertain? My sense is that the accusation there was satisfactorily answered, particularly by the opposing voters I was suppposed not to have notified. Will you be bringing a new ANI if I continue some particular activity (I'm not sure which, specifically), or will you block me summarily?
 I would appreciate it if you would point to specifics of what constitutes my """"ongoing disruption"""".
 I take it that you do not consider the subjects of my initial complaint (unilaterally overturning a conspicuous consensus) or the consequent rhetoric (persistant and repetitive spamming of """"reasons"""" which had all been addressed, persistant arguement ad hominem, and several insinuations that our responses are unethical or misleading, while the opposing rhetoric is self-evident) to be disruptive? Part of my defense to any accusation of campaigning would be to compile examples of the techniques of the opposition, so at least we could delineate what wiki considers unethical.

"I couldn't find any details about the pamphlet on-line, except those in the two library catalogues I cited.  I consulted the Australian National Library's copy and took a photocopy of it (24 pages).  I also tried poking around the Historical Association's website without finding anything relevant.
I have withdrawn my suggestion that Russell's description of the pamphlet was inaccurate.  The Historical Association apparently updates some of its older pamphlets occasionally, and it could well have done so with its Common Errors in History (although I have no evidence for that, other than Russell's description itself).  I did try browsing through the Australian National Library's collection of the  Historical Association's later pamphlets without finding anything else relevant.  But since the National Library's collection is incomplete, that doesn't mean very much.
It might be worth contacting the Historical Association itself to see if they can provide any further information.

"""Giambigarchy ==

Born on January 8, 1971 in West Covina California was a man who would grow to become a giant in the game of baseball. [|Jason Giambi]would move to the New York Yankees after winning the MVP award in 2001 with the Oakland Athletics. There he would never truly live up to his potential, until the year of our lord 2008. Going into the 2008 season that New York Yankees had a positive outlook returning countless all-star veterans, including [|Giambi], mixed with a crop of young talent not seen in the Yankee farm system in years. As the season progressed the Yankees did not reach the expectations of themselves, fans, and the entire front office. As the Yankees stumbled along, one of the bright spots was the fairly consistent play of [|Jason Giambi]. Minimal expectations had been placed upon him for the year, and his contributions had been important to the team staying above .500. With his fan popularity growing, he decided to try something that some may call ugly, but others may call the pinnacle of a potential religious or governmental view. As the fans and himself refer to it as, """"the stache"""", it has become an icon for not only [|Giambi], but the entire Yankee team. With other players such as Andy Pettite and Johnny Damon joining [|Giambi] with the facial hair, than shaving away, it was clear that this simple patch of lip fur was here to stay. Despite some claims that """"Just For Men"""" has been involved in the increasing color and thickness of said """"stache"""", there have been no official remarks from [|Giambi]. The infusion of the """"stache"""" into the everyday life of Yankee fans has formed the potential for a governmental ideology, justly named the Giambigarchy. It is a simple view which includes drinking plenty of beer, and growing incredible upper lip fur. A view that may conflict with the current Republican/Democratic debate for the upcoming election, but surely a view that would not start any wars in Iraq, or drive gasoline prices over $4.00/gallon. We of the Giambigarchy way of view encourage you took to take a long look at your own """"stache"""" and ask, """"Do I represent myself the way [|Jason Giambi] and his facial attributes do?"""" That is the only question required for acceptance of the Giambigarchy point of view, and we recommend any fan ask themselves that question. The governmental form under the Giambigarchy is a very open-minded yet structured form that allows for the basic freedoms of its followers, and party members, yet remains an extremely fun-loving and positive outlook on life that other religions, and governments have failed to achieve. The savior [|Jason Giambi] has led by example to bring together his followers, encouraging them to live their lives with what is referred to as """"stassion"""". This is a twist on passion, as of course one must dawn the proverbial mustache. This very close knit, and increasingly popular group has reached a new way of life, and the numbers of proud followers are completely staggering. Established in May of 2008, Giambigarchy registered members have reached to a total of 13,422 (as of July 5th, 2008).

Fair enough, mistakes happen. no problem ☺.
I am attempting to move this discussion to the talk page for the article in question, however, I will respond to the specific issues you seem to be having here.
You seem to be mincing terms (“view such fonts as Unicode” — reality is actually closer to the reverse of this statement), and (understandably) confusing very different subjects (characters, glyphs, fonts). I will try my best to address/explain what I assume to be the underlying issues (rather than just the symptoms).

The change I made to the article was nothing to do with fonts (that was only apparent to you specifically, the character exsited, and was likely downloaded sucessfully, but the font in use didn’t have a glyph to display it — the solution is simple: use a better font if you wish to see the glyph for the character). All I did was use the correct character (further discussion on the article talk page once I finish typing it).

Unicode is the standard character encoding these days, all others are now considered legacy. US-ASCII and ISO 8859-1 can both be treated/processed as UTF-8 (a character encoding for Unicode). Notable operating systems, and major applications in their entirity now use Unicode as their character encoding of choice, adding/allowing backwards-compatibility where needed (at least in good quality products/packages). This includes the majority of Microsoft products.
U+XXXX numbers are Unicode code points, an easy way to referrence specific characters without ambiguity, and need not concern the average person browsing the web.
Wikipedia pages are sent to you as UTF-8 (Unicode), so you’re ‘viewing them as Unicode’ anyway.
Fonts for US-ASCII/ISO 8859-1 are inter-changable in modern operating systems. The software with which you’re viewing this page is very likely written using Unicode character encoding (operating system & web browser).

Part of the reason for using the actual character natively in headings (on talk pages at least) was so that others could easily determine if their default system/browser configuration supported a more suitable range of characters, in order to be able to provide feedback about said character. It’s not like a missing glyph is causing an application failure (in which case I could understand your concerns).

Your claim that “My point is … about everybody else who can’t see the font correctly.” is seemingly baseless. Where is your evidence that anyone beyond yourself is having trouble seeing the glyph for this character? What about the people for whom the use of correct characters will help (those using speech-synthisis software)? If you can provide citation/evidence for this rather wild claim, I’d like to read it, otherwise I can’t help but feel you’re merely expressing your own wishes/preferrences/desires, dispite the other issues. What, beyond the issues you’ve encountered personally, are the reasons behind your disagreement with my changes? It seems that perhaps these articles are a little too close to your heart based on the nature and speed of your response(es) to the change.

“Article names here should be as simple as possible.” [emphasis; mine.]
No, article names should be as clear as possible, or as simple to comprehend/understand as possible, or provide for simplest readability. I suggest it may be worthwhile to read about the subject of usability (which is the dicipline concerned with making things easy to use).
Taking your argument further; should punctuation be removed too, as that would make titles much simpler, although less clear. Removing punctuation would mitigate the need to use percent-encoding in URLs, making MediaWiki itself simpler (although less flexible). I realise my example is counter-intuitive, but it was to emphasise the point that clarity, above all else is actually what’s important, not simplicity. A parallel example is user-interfaces; the most usable are not those which are simplest, but those which display the right information at the right time (clarity).

I’m familiar with how screen-readers function/operate. Not all ‘ride’ on top of the user’s browser. Blind people are not the only users of speech-synthisis software. 
Besides, you’re confusing the visual rendering of a charater (a glyph) with the character itself, and other representatinos/renderings of it (such as audio/speech). Modern screen-readers access the source-code of the page (the browser itself is just a vehicle to get to the desired page and/or aquire the source-code itself, along with the character encoding). So they’re given",0

Reasons for removal:

 Abu Huraira is one of the most prolific muhaddithin and a source of many of the sahih hadith.

I was blocked for harrassment and disruption
 There is nothing indicating anyone being harrassed, per the descriptions given in WP:HAR
 The claim of """"disruption"""" is one-sided and removes the relevant history of how this became a dispute. I have caused no disruptionI have responded to them, as will be outlined
 The origins of this dispute are in the complaints, since verified, of longstanding racist ranting and anti-Semitic personal attacks by . That was the first disruption that I responded too, as this editor's rants were a constant disruption of the editing process and his dispicable rants were a flarant violation of WP:TALK
 I filed a complaint at WP:ANI and was told to """"shut the hell up"""" by an editor who then archived the case.
 I filed a new complaint at WP:WQA here documenting the racist rants, and Jew baiting personal attacks by . There I was falsely told by  that there was """"consensus"""" on WQA to """"let it go, even though all there was on WQA was the """"shut the hell up"""" comment"""" and more rants by . This complaint at least resulted in some recognition of the problem with this anti-Semite, and a warning to him.   
 When  continued his disruptive editing and racial/anti-Semitic taunting, including characterizing the Holocaust as the """"Holohoax,"""" I filed another WP:ANI documenting 's continued violations. ultimately this resulted in corroboration once again, and a 3 day block of the racist editor. However, in the course of what should havee beena simple case, given the glaring evidence against , there were disruptions by other editors and harrassment of me in the course of that filing. Among other things I was 
 """"basically attacking him () non-stop for quite some time now"""" with no evidence presented of my """"attacks"""" and in complete disregard of the endless racial taunting I had endured
  Told that my complaints against this vile racist """"looks like a bit of a hit-job, designed to get him blocked for disagreeing"""" This """"blaming the victim is where I questioned why it was that I was being charged with orchestrating a conspiracy (""""hit job"""") against a clearly racist, anti-Semitic editor. Bringing up the latent anti-Semitic undertones in that accusation is not """"harrassmentif anything, the contention that I was somehow conspiring against this editor is harrassment.
 Challenged about my complaint about the use of """"Holohoax"""", when it was quite clear to anyone taking a moment to read that it was being used in a noxious manner by  (and which is now agreed)
 Told that I was somehow violating 's """"free speech"""", when {WP:TALK]]'s first, bold faced advice is Article talk pages should not be used by editors as platforms for their personal views. I questioned if somehow anti-Semitic rants were an exception to this rule, since I was being told I was somehow impinging upon the anti-Semtic editor's rights and free speech. I still question that.
was told by user ''' AGAIN to """"shut the hell up: Can you read, Boodles? This is getting ridiculous.

Peer review

I've archived all the previous discussion in preperation for extensive work on this article.  Hopefully the peer review can help use on our way to FA status.  I'll add my comments about what needs to be done shortly.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

 New layout 

I think we need a better layout, and this is what I propose (based on other religous pages):

Etymology
Originating from Sanskrit (śiṣya or śikṣā) or Pali (sikkhā).
Beliefs
One god - reference to what god is in Sikh thought, reference the Mul Mantra as underlying the characteristics of God
Thoughts on birth, death, reincarnation, karma - relation to dharmic faiths and crucially how Sikhism differs
Equality of people regardless of race, religion, caste etc,
History
General climate in India at the time
The Sikh gurus; placing special emphasis on Nanak as the founder, and Gobind Singh as the founder of the Khalsa
The Guru Granth Sahib
Influences in Sikhism post-Gurus (famous Sikhs like Banda Bahadur and Ranjit Singh).  Including influence of the British, and issue in independent India.
Scripture
Guru Granth Sahib (creation of, layout and content)
Dasam Granth (and controversy)
Janam Sakhis
Other scripture
Khalsa
Sikhs
Five Ks
Punjab and punjabi culture and how it relates to Sikhism
Sikhism in the diaspora
New Sikh converts
Institutions
Places of worship (Gurdwaras)
Harimandir Sahib, Akal Takht (spirtual and temporal - duties of both)
SGPC and other gurdwara administration committees
Sects and groups
Talk about differing groups of Sikhs (including caste distinctions which still persist contrary to Sikh teachings)
Udasis, Nirankaris and others

In addition, we need to get rid of the mass of links at the bottom of the page, as well as the audio files which are not relevant on this page.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

Pictures and Table

I don't see the need in having 2 pictures of men wearing turbans. I think one of them should be replaced by a picture of one of the 5 K's or maybe even a picture of a Guru.

Also, I think the order of the columns in the table containing information about the Gurus needs to be changed. I think all dates should be read in chronological order, which means that the """"Date of Birth"""" column should come before the """"Guruship on"""" column. This to me is a more logical order.
 

Yes, I agree with your comments.  We'll incorporate your commments in the re-write.  The dates of the Gurus also need fact checking and have been flagged for some while.   | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

Okay, all done.  Please check the new picture.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

That is a much better picture, thank you! There is something I am unsure about though and I hope someone can resolve the matter. In that table about the Gurus it says that Guru Nanak received his guruship the day he was born. Is this a widely accepted belief amongst the Sikh community? I ask because I had always thought that Guru Nanak became a Guru the day he emerged from the river Bain and said """"There is neither Hindu nor Muslim..."""" and recited the Mool Mantra for the first time. I am not entirely sure though. Am I mistaken to believe this?  

It could also be viewed that as there was nobody (well, apart from God I suppose), to pass their guruship onto him, he was a guru since birth.  I believe your way of looking at it is definately better and I will change it.  By the way, feel free to edit any of the articles on Wikipedia.  There are plenty of problems on the Sikhism-related pages and none were really written by scholars.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

 Styles 

I'm a bit unsure how to proceed with general styling in the article.

 Regarding Nundah 

Dear Lanky

It is interesting that you are happy to have Mr Swan's electoral office listed as the """"major attraction"""" in previous versions of the  Nundah page but have removed reference to Mr Swan from the Gordon Nuttall page.  I believe this to be the main reason for your section deletion on the Gordon Nuttall page.  I feel sad for a community with an electoral office as their major attraction.  

What irks me even more is your sloppy version of Nundah history.  Leichhardt didn't simply """"visit the mission"""".  The Prussian Ludwig Leichhardt visited the mission during his historic expedition to the north of Australia.

Furthermore, they were not """"German"""" Lutherans.  One cannot emigrate from a country that has not yet been formed (Germany was formed in 1871). They were largely from Silesia i.e. Silesians (go to the Nundah cemetery you are so proud of and read some gravestones) and victims of religious persecution by the Prussians. See the Barossa Valley page for a more correct description of the Silesian emigrants. They were categorized as Germans by the British.

I congratulate you on your contributions to the Nundah page but this sloppy research by the Nundah history crew is often recanted by others.  I'll let you fix the Nundah page.

In my opinion, you're confusing different policies. You say that everything you write there is sourced; for the sake of the argument, I shan't dispute that (even though a very good point is raised there, regarding the difference between sourced and attributed). However, sourcing is required to comply with Wikipedia's policy on verifiability. Soapboxing, advocating and giving undue weight, on the contrary, are not permitted under Wikipedia's policy on neutrality. So, even if everything you state there is sourced, it still can't be included if it violates WP:NPOV.
It's not a matter of not liking what sources have to say; it's just that they are only opinions. I don't think criticism should be hidden or Amanda's guilt taken for granted. Actually, I don't even know if she did it, because, quite frankly, I never studied the case, but I'm convinced that if a Court of law convicted her, there must have been sufficient evidence to warrant that. Italy's not Soviet Russia... My point is that the article shouldn't mainly revolve around criticism of the trial or attempts at soiling Guede's reputation, by implying that he was a lone killer, as that, primarily, violates WP:BLP. Wikipedia is not there to retry Amanda. As I've said, I agree that criticism should be reported; it is notable and rather easily sourced. However, that should not be the focus of the article. 
Finally, as I wrote on the article's page, technically the trial record is publicly avalaible, but that doesn't mean that it was actually accessed or published (even in Italian, for that matters)...   ''''''  Let's talk 'bout it! """,0

The solution to this is very simple. Find a source which says this isn't genocide. If you can't, then the article can't say that it might not have been genocide. Do you think you're the only person who has ever wanted to write something that can't be supported by WP:RS? I can think of a hundred occassions when it has stopped me contributing something I consider blindingly obvious. But WP:RS is the only way to keep Wikipedia halfway honest.
To address your criticism of the article, I point out that governments, for obvious reasons, are reluctant to issue a direct order to commit genocide even if genocide is their aim. Even Hitler didn't issue a direct order to gas all of the Jews in Europe. That doesn't mean that the Holocaust wasn't genocide. They will also always claim that the genocide was quid pro quo, or an unavoidable part of a war they are committing. The Kosovo war is an excellent example of this.
But many people today seem to think genocide, brutal warfare, terror actions and large massacres are the same thing and can all be called """"genocide"""" when you like. No way. During the Rwanda war, Madeleine Albright famously said that genocide wasn't being committed, but that acts of genocide were. How many massacres make a genocide? You seem to think it is obvious that this episode of massacres did not add up to genocide. But the point at which many massacres become genocide is, tragically, subjective.   """,0

"Water in the Coliseum

FWIW, I watched a program on the History channel a couple of months ago, the focus of which was a chemical study of the makeup of the plaster used in the Coliseum, and examination of the flooding and drainage facilities the Romans had built into the coliseum.

The program concluded that the plaster used contained small, but notable amounts of the substance that the Romans used in aqueducts for waterproofing, but not enough that it was designed to be a permanent feature of the arena. It also concluded that the coliseum could have been flooded overnight, and that it was probably built with it being flooded shortly after completion- but not again after that- in mind.

If one sets ones sights low enough, and claim the goal of the operation was merely to establish a bridgehead, then it was a clear Soviet victory. However I seriously doubt the goal was only to gain a bridgehead, but rather to punch through the Panther Line, which the Soviets clearly failed to do. While the overall campaign was a clear strategic victory for the Soviets because they won the campaign in the end, it was a tactical victory for the Germans because they were successful in holding Narva even though it was not long lasting, i.e. six months.

If f(x) is a 4th degree polynomial and p,q,r,s are root approximations, the approximated polynomial is (x-p)(x-q)(x-r)(x-s) and its derivative at p is (p-q)(p-r)(p-s) so a Durand-Kerner iteration for p would be p = p - f(x)/((p-q)(p-r)(p-s)) and iterations of identical form for q, r, and s follow immediately.

Incidentally, regarding """"form"""", when I looked at the mark-up behind the """"essay"""" it showed that the editor had separated it into paragraphs by indenting the separate paras, rather than leaving blank-lines, so it was just a case of a new-editor not being familiar with the correct way to format paragraphs, and ending up with one long para, hence looking like a """"rant"""". Also, new editors tend not to be familiar with the idea of keeping to the salient points and wiki-linking to in-depth articles. talk|contribs """,0
"Battle of Levounion 1091 not copyright violation and (Manzikert- Anatolia was not ethnic cleansing) 

Pechenegs had been driven out of their homeland by the Cumans and settled in Northern Bulgaria since some years, they raided and invaded Byzantine Thrace with their families and intended to settle at the Maritza river,[1]

But at the Battle of Levounion 1091 the Pechenegs were attacked by a combined army of Byzantines with Cuman mercenaries, the Pechenegs were almost totally killed, soldiers and civilians, this battled nearly annihilated the Pecheneg people. Later the survivors were massacred in the Battle of Beroia. (This is clearly ethnic cleansing, even if they were a newly migrated people to the Balkans.) 

I added:
At the Battle of Levounion (1091), the Pecheneg, a nomadic Turkic people from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, were nearly wiped out by the sedentary Byzantine Greeks and nomadic Cumans.{{cite book|last=Agbedo|first=Chris|title=Problems of multilingual nations  the Nigerian perspective|year=2007|publisher=Fidgina Global Books|location=Enugu, Nigeria|isbn=9789788132844|page=89|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&hl;=nl&q;=ethnic+cleansing+greeks+pechenegs&btnG;=#hl=nl&tbm;=bks&sclient;=psy-ab&q;=The+Pechenegs%2C+nomadic+Turkic+peop-o+from+the+steppe%2C+were+nearly+annihilated+at+the+Battle+of+Levounion+by+a+combined+Byzantine+and+Cuman+army+in+1091.&oq;=The+Pechenegs%2C+nomadic+Turkic+peop-o+from+the+steppe%2C+were+nearly+annihilated+at+the+Battle+of+Levounion+by+a+combined+Byzantine+and+Cuman+army+in+1091.&gs;_l=serp.12...21850.21850.3.22808.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.1...1c..15.psy-ab.NHxON2jEZfU&pbx;=1&bav;=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm;=bv.47244034,d.d2k&fp;=1f7c60039cb2be7d&biw;=1438&bih;=647

Original sentence was: The Pechenegs, nomadic Turkic people from the steppe, were nearly annihilated at the Battle of Levounion by a combined Byzantine and Cuman army in 1091.

I changed this into  At the Battle of Levounion (1091), the Pecheneg, a nomadic Turkic people from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, were nearly wiped out by the sedentary Byzantine Greeks and nomadic Cumans.

Manzikert Anatolia
This was added from the same book: After the Battle of Manzikert (1071), Greek populations of Anatolia were ethnically cleansed by nomadic Seljuk Turks

But the original sentence in the book was:[1]
The ethnic cleansing of sedentary Greek population of Anatolia by nomadic Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071.

If Levounion is copyright violation than this is also.

The idea that Seljuk Turks ethnically cleansed Anatolia is not true, Anatolian Greek populations survived till 1922, the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Claiming Seljuks ethnically cleansed Anatolia is historically incorrect, it had a multicultural population, besides Seljuks had a sedentary state Seljuk Empire,  besides this claim was based upon one source, which was added by cherry picking and snippet abuse. So this must be removed  because of factual inaccuracy.",0

The above paragraph is total nonsense.  It has no meaning.  Saying """"God is a paradox"""" is equivalent to saying """"God cannot exist"""" and I don't think that was your intent.  In addition, claiming that infinity cannot be understood is a vague statement at best, and even if true it still wouldn't be an argument for the existence or omnipotence of a god.  Lastly, you clearly didn't understand the God/rock argument so let me try to help.  If you claim the answer is yes, then God has a limit, if the answer is no, then God also has a limit.  Therefore God, or any being for that matter, must have limits of some kind.  Saying he could choose to not be able to implies that he could choose to be capable of it, and therefore one can simply conclude that he is capable of that act.""",0

The actual rights of an actual person are being recognized as primary over the potential rights of a potential person.

Comment Hi There, In spite all my effort, I don’t expect any understanding or help from the other side regarding the English version of the article about Alexander Voytovych. Therefore if one insists on deleting this particular article then go ahead as it seems to me there is no room for democratic thinking on your website whatsoever. I’d like to add a few more words as my final statement.

The art works and art life of the artist is the sourcefor academic press, Ukrainian media, academic institutions, as well as poets, writers and publications use his paintings & drawings to illustrate books.

If one convinced that the article has to be deleted, than do not hesitate to do so, but before that please give me a straight answer to my question. What is the difference between the article about Alexander Voytovych and, for example, the Herb Roe’s article, why the mentioned article is considered more accurate? I must highlight once again that instead of explaining what has to be changed or corrected on the page, one awards us with thenoticeboards. Regarding self-promotion  which was mentioned a few times I’d like to make it clear  the artists is a Ukrainian and naturally all sources are Ukrainian, and if the mentioned language is unknown to one it doesn’t meant that it allows one doubts the genuine sources. The Ukrainian and Russian versions of Wikipedia have accepted the article and honoured it, which says a lot.I had in my mind to present more Ukrainian artist, however having such an experience; I’d rather leave this business behind thanks to you. Thanks for co-operation. From my point of view this discussion is exceeded, feel free to delete the article!

 Blocking Mardyks  

Excellent work there Shii. We can't have his kind getting us to think about what the Maya actually say about their own prophecies. We insulted him, offended him and abused him and he just had to be ethical and persistant. BLOCK those Mother Fukkers!!! Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also. There may be others of his kind, that sympathize with those """"Indians"""". These people actually LOVE the Earth and that is without reliable sources! We kicked their asses and have the right to write THEIR history and interpret THEIR sacred teachings however we please. We need more from college students who have been indoctrinated in the Church of Academia. That piece by Stitler is one of the most exaggerated and opinionated and so yeah, use that as the title of the page! And by all means give John MAJOR Jenkins his own section. Not a single scholar or Mayanists agrees with his appropriated theory and this kind of hypocrisy and arrogance is what Wiki is all about. We can get away with it, by continuing to use our power to censor free thinkers like Mardyks and his kind. Sony Pictures is paying us all off with tickets, so let us know how many you want.

""""WP:OUTING"""" redirects here. For the alternate meaning of outing, as in excursion, see Wikipedia:Meetup.
For the Wikimedia privacy policy, see Wikimedia:Privacy policy.
Posting another editor's personal information is harassment, unless that person voluntarily had posted his or her own information, or links to such information, on Wikipedia. Personal information includes legal name, date of birth, identification numbers, home or workplace address, job title and work organisation, telephone number, email address, or other contact information, whether any such information is accurate or not. Posting such information about another editor is an unjustifiable and uninvited invasion of privacy and may place that editor at risk of harm outside of their activities on Wikipedia. This applies to the personal information of both editors and non-editors. It also applies in the case of an editor who has requested a change in username, but whose old identifying marks can still be found. Any edit that """"outs"""" someone must be reverted promptly, followed by a request for Oversight to delete that edit from Wikipedia permanently. If an editor has previously posted their own personal information but later redacted it, it should not be repeated on Wikipedia; although references to still-existing, self-disclosed information is not considered outing. If the previously posted information has been removed by Oversight, then repeating it on Wikipedia is considered outing.

The fact that a person either has posted personal information or edits under their own name, making them easily identifiable through online searches, is not an excuse for """"opposition research"""". Dredging up their off line opinions to be used to constantly challenge their edits can be a form of harassment, just as doing so regarding their past edits on other Wikipedia articles may be. However, if individuals have identified themselves without redacting or having it oversighted, such information can be used for discussions of conflict of interest in appropriate forums. If redacted or oversighted personally identifying material is important to the COI discussion, then it should be emailed privately to an administrator or arbitrator – but not repeated on Wikipedia: it will be sufficient to say that the editor in question has a COI and the information has been emailed to the appropriate administrative authority.

If you see an editor post personal information about another person, do not confirm or deny the accuracy of the information. Doing so would give the person posting the information and anyone else who saw the page feedback on the accuracy of the material. Do not treat incorrect attempts at outing any differently from correct attempts for the same reason. When reporting an attempted outing take care not to comment on the accuracy of the information. Outing should usually be described as """"an attempted outing"""" or similar, to make it clear that the information may or may not be true, and it should be made clear to the users blocked for outing that the block log and notice does not confirm the information.

Unless unintentional and non-malicious (for example, where Wikipedians know each other off-site and may inadvertently post personal information, such as using the other person's real name in discussions), attempted outing is grounds for an immediate block.

Threats to out an editor will be treated as a personal attack and dealt with accordingly.  """,0

Not only does this source clearly state the Adidam position that """"to address Adi Da as """"Ruchira"""" (Sanskrit for """"radiant"""") is acknowledge Him as """"the Radiant, Shining, 'Bright' One"""", which those outside the group or not in sympathy with it (non-devotees) would not acknowledge, but a google search for """"Ruchira Avatar Adi Da Samraj"""" confirms that what comes up in any signficant order, excluding this article itself, for that title, is either Adidam sites and material or that of devotees. There is no thus evidence to support your claim that non-devotees would routinely refer to him by anything other than """"Adi Da"""" (his primary name per the source), his name during the controversial period (Da Free John), or his given name of Franklin Jones today, rather than """"the Ruichira Avatar Adi Da Samraj"""" (meaning """"the radiant avatar, primordial giver, universal ruler""""), or as """"Beloved"""" either, which as per the source, devotees would use. Thus, """"or to his devotees as..."""" and defining what the titles and names mean to devotees, is perfectly appropriate and informative. 

The addition of all the names in the intro instead of just a few improves the article because Adi Da has been known by so many names, that it is important for the casual reader to know up front all these are the same person. The introduction isn't excessively long, it is only six sentences. One describes what him, one lists his many names, one sumarizes his dogma, one describes the highly publicized allegations, one lists the Adidam response, and one specifies these charges were settled out of court. Concise, simple, NPOV and based on sound sourcing, and appropriate.

Re:Al-Shabaab
You have reverted to the following extract regarding foreign involvement in Al-Shabaab:

Of the foreign members, Jonathan Evans, head of the British MI5, indicated in 2010 that around 100 British nationals of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and West African backgrounds had traveled to Somalia to train under the group, and that their presence there could inspire terrorist incidents in the UK.[57] Their travel costs were allegedly funded by sympathizers in Britain.[58]

This is incorrect because: (1) Evans is no longer head of MI5; (2) the speech that Evans gave - which was linked to in the text that you removed - made no mention of the numbers of British nationals or their ethnicity; that was a bit of hyperbole added by the reporter; (3) the numbers are, in any case, disputed, with The Sunday Times estimating the number at 50 and another report from The Daily Telegraph suggesting 60; (4) The citation [58] (which, incidentally, suggests the figure of 60) does not support the assertion that travel costs are 'allegedly funded'. It does, however, point out the criminal conviction (i.e. 'beyond reasonable doubt') of an Al-Shabaab financier.

The removal of the link to the actual speech seems particularly obtuse. 86.183.79.59  

Hi. Here's what you wrote:

Jonathan Evans, the former head of MI5, addressing a London security conference in 2010  , advised that a significant number of UK residents were training with al-Shabaab. It is only a matter of time before we see terrorism on our streets inspired by those who are today fighting alongside al-Shabaab. The actual number has been estimated at between 50  and 100  persons; there is also evidence of funding of the group by British citizens.

First, the italicization of what Evans stated back in 2010 (when, incidentally, Al-Shabaab was much stronger than it is now) is both undue and unencylopedic. A simple """"predicted that their presence there could inspire terrorist incidents in the UK"""" will suffice.

In Evans' speech link, he indicates the following  """"The percentage of the priority plots and leads we see in the UK linked to Al Qaida in the tribal areas of Pakistan, where Al Qaida senior leadership is still based, has dropped from around 75% two or three years ago to around 50% now. This does not mean that the overall threat has reduced but that it has diversified. The reduction in cases linked to the Tribal areas of Pakistan is partly attributable to the pressure exerted on the Al Qaida leadership there. But the reduction is also partly a result of increased activity elsewhere. In Somalia, for example, there are a significant number of UK residents training in Al Shabaab camps to fight in the insurgency there."""" In other words, the same multinational network of would-be Al-Qaida fighters that traveled to Pakistan were also starting to travel to other areas back in 2010, including the Al-Shabaab-controlled parts of Somalia. Also note that Evans specifically attributes this growth in Al-Shabaab to the fact that Somalia, like Afghanistan, at the time had """"no effective government"""". It does no",0

For the paragraph:

Some judges are also known to rule against precedent on principle. A judge (or even an interim appeal court) may rule against a precedent that is outdated. The judge may feel the decision needs to be overturned due to more sophisticated legal reasoning. Such a judge may wish to help the law evolve by ruling against precedent and thereby indirectly inducing a losing party to appeal. The appeal court will then have an opportunity to review the lower court's decision and may adopt the lower court's reasoning, thereby overturning previous case law. This may also happen several times as the case works its way through intermediate appellate jurisdictions.

 Clarification 

Posted from User talk:IZAK#Meshullam Gross  
Hi IZAK, thanks for that neat move of Nachlas Tzvi. Only two issues - one fairly significant.

1.If you want to be pedantic, he actually went by the English name of Herman Gross. Meshulam Tzvi was his Hebrew name and used in his Seforim.
2.Technically speaking and according to the information availible to me, he was NOT a Rabbi. Apparently (or so I've been told), he was offered Semicha many times and was certainly able, but never accepted it.
Therefore, I deliberately refrained from placing him in any Rabbi category, let alone the Haredi category. Off the point since he wasnt a Rabbi, I object to terming him """"Haredi"""" as the boundaries in his age were fluid and the word wasnt even used. Indeed, by todays standards he may not have been """"Haredi"""" (whatever that irksome term means). Many thanks,  """,0

Actually no. Most who have declared themselves as Albanians, have also declared themselves as Muslims.

Most of the houses in this part of the village are however abandoned even though the Church has been recently restored. According to our (Albanian Muslim) informants, these migrated Orthodox Christian Albanians assimilated within the Macedonian culture and now prefer to be labelled as “Macedonians”, even if they are still able to fluently speak Albanian.

 The phonology of Urdu appears to be different enough from that of Hindi because of (however artificial) phonemes not, for instance, present in Hindi as they are of Persian derivation. WP:CFORK simply does not apply because here is not a case of (I quote the """"this page in a nutshell"""" box) """"Articles should not be split into multiple articles just so each can advocate a different stance on the subject"""", since there is no """"stance"""" to be taken, it's just a matter of Urdu phonology being different from Hindi phonology. If you want the differences between Urdu and Hindi phonology to be more prominently highlighted than they are now you can, as I said, do it yourself (you can't expect to force others to add content, surely). As to code-switching, for other languages this seems to be tackled by having a separate article about the common code-switching mixtures (Spanglish and so on) and linking them in the """"See also"""" sections, so feel free to do this if you want, for what I'm concerned.

Reverting vandalism is much easier than debating though, which is why I've assisted in maintaining the page. The biggest problem is that the definition of main event varies. For example, why is Chavo/Kane from WM24, a match never promoted by the company as a main event, listed, but not Flair/Michaels from the same show, which the company considered making the actual main event (and, indeed, several WWE folks said afterwards that it should have). Other examples exist. Why Kane/Undertaker from WMXX, but not Undertaker/Michaels from WM25, another match which was heavily promoted and considered for the final match on the show? (Presumably, it's because someone around here is a Kane fan) Because of these (and other) inconsistancies, we should limit it the actual final match on the card.  0422

 Maba Diakhou Bâ 

I first came across the Maba Diakhou Bâ article when I was looking for articles relating to Senegambia.  Having read the view history section of the article, it was evident that it has been on display for quite a few years now.

The purpose of starting this discussion is to disagree with several aspects of the historical account being presented in the Maba Diakhou Bâ article, based on reliable secondary sources as stated in the notablity policy.  Although I have primary documents about the man Maba Diakhou Bâ, I will stick to secondary sources in line with Wiki's policy.  Before I start to put forward my counter argument, I think a brief history is necessary for those who are not well familiar with the subject.  

Maba was a Senegambian jihadist in the 19th century who spent years launching wars against non-Muslim Kingdoms in order to convert them to Islam.  As it will become clearer , you will find out that converting people to Islam was not his only objective for launching jihad.  In any case, he was partly responsible for the mass conversion of the Senegambian people particularly the Wolof people and other tribes in the 19th century.  This is very significant, because Senegambia which encompasses Senegal and The Gambia are predominantly Muslim countries.  The Muslim population are the descendants of those converted in masses in the 19th century many of whom by Maba Diakhou Bâ.  Islam being very strong in both Senegal and The Gambia especially with the advent of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, Maba Diakhou Bâ is given a saint like figure in both Senegal and The Gambia.  As such, no one dares to comment on the atrocities of Maba, his back handed dealings with the French and British administration during the colonial era, his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non-Muslims, his pillaging of lands etc.  Instead, the Muslim majority of Senegambia led by the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal have fabricated his historical account and pass it off as facts that some historians have fallen for, but of course there are others who will not be duped and have examined the true facts and written it accordingly.  It is very important to point out here that, not all ordinary Senegambian Muslims feel this way.  Many of them try to go about their daily lives with little thought for these kind of things.  There are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infallible even if ample evidence is presented to them.  In most cases, when I talk about the Senegambian Muslim masses, I am referring to the Senegambian Muslim establishment, who mingle in politics, control what historical or religious programmes are presented in the media etc.  These are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe.   Having said all that, I now address each of the inaccurate accounts presented in Maba's article.  

Maba was killed on the 18th July 1867 at the Battle of Fandane Thiouthiogne commonly known in Senegambian history as
The Battle of Somb. He was killed by the Serer people led by their King Buur Sine Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof when he thought he could go and launch his jihad against the Serer people as he had done with other non-Muslim tribes and kingdoms.  (Sources: Histoire du Sine-Saloum  by Alioune Sarr, and Essai sur l’histoire du Saloum et du rip by Abdou Bouri Bâ)

The article did not give us the exact date he died and in the """"Death and legacy"""" heading, made a transitional error as to the year he died by putting """"1876"""" instead of """"1867"""". I will also address that section of the article later especially in relation to the first paragraph

In the first paragraph of this article, it says and I quote """"He became leader Almamy in Saloum"""" and under the """"Resistance and Conquest"""" heading,  (in other words resisting French colonialism as noted in the first paragraph of that heading) it states and I quote 
""""While he eventually succeeded in overtaking the dynasty of Saloum, his movement never succeeded in Sine, (Kingdom of Sine) and much of Serer territory remained animist or Christian into the 20th century.""""

First of all, Maba was nothing more than an Almamy in rebellion.  He was not a King with all the powers of a King and him overthrowing the Serer Dynasty of Saloum has not been accurately narrated in this article which I will delve in later.  Note also that in the last paragraph of the first heading, the article talks about how Maba founded Nioro du Rip, but it did not tell us in any part of the article how he founded it, just like in the whole article, important pieces of information has been",0
"I'm sorry 
I can see now that nothing I say will be read as sincere. I'm sorry that this is the case. I really was trying to help things. I felt that if I told you my side of things you might understand me better. I wasn't trying to lecture you. I really feel like I have been attacked from the beginning. Whether or not you think it is correct isn't really the issue. It is the way I feel. If you think through how things have happened you will see that it is a pretty legitimate feeling. We both reverted three times (I counted). If you want to call me the bad guy for reverting, then call him the bad guy too. If you want to accuse me of being disrespectful, show me where. I wasn't disrespectful until the point at which you reverted my suggestion, yet you accuse me of being disrespectful before that point.

Basically, if you're going to start off accusing me and not caring about my view of the situation, then what hope do I have of having my POV appreciated in the consensus? None! The mediator of the discussion is already convinced I'm in the wrong. You can delete this if you want, but I hope you read it first. I'm not trying to point fingers!! I'm just trying to help you understand...

From my view, you felt like you needed to step in and help with an edit war. You set some ground rules and are trying to establish a consensus. You saw me and thought I was adding something questionable to the article. You reverted it, thinking the article would then be in its original state. (This wasn't the case. My edit was the original.) You somehow saw my edits as disrespectful. You saw my change as a deliberate attempt to violate consensus when I thought it was a step in the right direction. I saw someone chide me in all caps and reacted defensively, pretty natural reaction, right?

Neither of us are in the wrong here, or both of us are.   

Wrad, I think the problem is that you mean one thing but say another. For example, you call this an apology...give me a break...you're just justifying your actions and insulting me in the process.

"Your recent reverts on Naturopathic medicine 

I see that you have recently reverted some edits to the naturopathy page. I note that you have given as your reason that the changes to the lead were POV, but that you have not bothered to explain why you think this is so in the discussion page.

Could you please explain why you think it is POV for the article to describe naturopathy as an approach to medicine rather than a single proffesion or standard of care? Do you dispute the fact, or the way in which it was written? I am open to rewriting/compromising to get consensus on an NPOV, but if you are not willing to explain yourself, this will be very difficult. Do you really think that the umberella term 'naturopathic medicine' is represenatative of single entity, group or way of practicing medicine? Could you back this up?
 Could you also explain why it would be considered POV for the article to mention that the principles of naturopathy are practiced in multiple settings (complementary, alternative, and primary care) by traditional healers, NDs, MDs, DOs DC's etc...? Again, do you dispute this fact or the way it was written? I have provided citations for this, did you even consult them before deleting my work? Can you provide a citation asserting the opposite (that naturopathic medicine is an exlusive term owned and used by a single organisation to the exlusion of other types of practitioners)?
Your assertion that naturopathic medicine is 'CAM, not medicine' could be misconstrued to reveal a deep and irrational bias on your behalf. (What do you imagine the 'M' in 'CAM' stands for?) The fact that the term 'medicine' without a modifier is usually interpretted to mean conventional/regular/normal medicine does not mean that the less common practices are somehow not medicine.

I hope that you will take the time to participate in the discussion of the above on the talk page. I will continue to edit what I see as helpful NPOV information about the complex breadth and scope of naturopathy untill you can explain what it is that you do not like about the contributions I have made. On the one hand I can't work in a vaccuum, but on the other hand I won't be bullied into submission either.

One more thought: your vague references to various WPs could be viewed as a form of wikilawyering: I hope that you will consider explaining the violations that you percieve rather than continuing to set up an all out edit war.",0

Norman,

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site started as a non-commercial site and contains a great deal of island history as well as many, many island pictures. It's one of the most popular sites in the Lake Erie Islands.

Please take a look at """"Site Map Page 1"""" and """"Site Map Page 2"""" before removing the link again. Saying that the hundreds of pages listed there have only commercial value is idiotic.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

So what is your real rationale for deleting it again and again and again???

I contend that you have failed miserably in the """"great test of one's strength to recognize when to help raise the level of discussion rather than inflaming tense situations"""" and should have known better given your display of """"apparent"""" authority.

My response contained words and statements that were correctly and appropriately describing (with civil English words) the FACTS in relation to nature of his personal attacks on me.
In my attempt to obtain an apology from him, while Lacking any support against his attack, you decided to label me the transgressor, but not him.
You appear to be very negligent and biased acting in your """"appointed role here???"""" to say the least, if not totally malicious.

 Extraterrestrial hypothesis 

Howdy.  You modified some changes I had made to the intro to ETH.  I had posted some commentary on the reasons behind the changes on the talk page; it would have been nice if you had commented there, especially since I left it open for commentary for over a month before I put the change in place ;-).  If you disliked the way it's written now, you should see what it said before I changed it.  And just removing the citation (which I spent quite some time finding) is not very helpful.  Anyway, other than my slightly bruised ego, your point about the citation not mentioning ETH is well taken.  Regardless of terminology they distinctly were *not* talking about ETH but about UFOs.  I will try to change it to reflect that.  What the citation supports is the notion that when scientists review the evidence at hand, they conclude that some UFO reports merit further study, but they don't really comment much on ETH.  E.g. the notion that there's even a minority support for ETH in mainstream science is wrong.  And leaving the comment """"a few scientists ..."""" is zero info, since you can pretty much find a """"a few"""" scientists supporting any notion.

 Concerns
Got a message about an hour ago from Professor Obar of the Media and Telecommunication Policy project and I think it is viewed best in full:

Can you please communicate to the online mentors that I DO NOT want them moving student material into the main space for them. This is a big problem. I have noticed that this has happened with a number of the projects already, for example, in the broadband.gov article and the media cross-ownership article. We need the students to be doing this on their own, of course so they can learn how to do it, and also so that I can grade what they've done. How am I supposed to follow student submissions if the data is associated with online mentors? A BIG PROBLEM ALREADY... please help me with this. None of you responded to my post about this on the discussion page. This is about to get out of hand. Jaobar (talk) 

With that, of course, please only give instructions on how to move, don't do it for them.  Please only let them know what to do and let them do it themselves.  If they run into problems, provide further instructions.  Do not it for them.  This seems to be making a mess of Prof. Obar's grading system and I would like to avoid that.  Thanks. -  • Talk • Coor.

Why should I be involved be anymore editing (although I really want to) when I know that some daft hater may simply revert ALL of them without caring much about silly things like justification or consequence and I will be blocked as a result? I shouldn't be involved. Wikipedia, like any other bureaucracy, is ruled by bullies (including some administrators). However, the real bureaucracies do give you a chance to settle the dispute in court or police station. And at least you can afford to not be so helpless about it. Here my edits were labelled as propaganda (implying that I'm a propagandist) after all my edits were rashly reverted (although they had the chance to simply modify inaccuracies with good sources, they chose to delete the whole section), nothing was done and because nothing was done, the reversion of my edits only accelerated (now, if not all, most of my edits are entirely reverted).  Then that genius John wrote on my talk-page  I'm edit-warring? I usually specifically mention (no edit-war intended) after my edit, in description. My friggin edits are getting reverted and I'm the one he deemed to be the edit-warrior? Come on now, will you. You don't want to help me. Frankly, I don't know what you want. Have a beautiful time here at the wikipedia. Humanity is withering away much faster here at the wikipedia than in the real world. The real world is sick in my view. But, in comparison to the demented arrangement here at wikipediaBecause here it every time sometimes  gratuitously comes down to majority of consensus, no matter how ignorant and/or prejudiced and/or oblivious the involved editors are about the topic at hand, their views still count. That's not a very efficient way, that is rather a crazy medieval way of discerning what's reliable and what's not. And thus, implies that minority is always wrong and majority is always correct. That's fundamentally incorrect., real world seems like a much better place to dwellAlthough I concede that some (few) of my sources too were questionable and faced justified skepticism, I don't think that it necessitated a whole reversion. Slight modifications would have worked just fine.. Thank God science doesn't progress like that in real world.  (Talk?)

Winifred's painting technique for the pharaonic portraits:

. . . I turned to the statutes and reliefs. These would show me how the sitters impressed the artists of those days, and the work of an artist's chisel or brush is at least as good evidence as the sworn word of a witness in a court of law, at any rate when the artist is as literal-minded as were the Egyptians. Do we not know the honest mistakes a man in the witness-box can make? And shall we not concede the difference between a trained and an untrained observer?The ancient artist was a trained observer; I would examine his trained evidence on what he saw, and compare it with what I could see today of the Pharaohs. This done, discrepancies appeared which could not be disregarded. And besides, the various artists who portrayed a Pharaoh did not all agree in detail among themselves. This added to the difficulty! It was evident that some detailed and perhaps laborious comparing would have to be done. I had recourse again to the mummy, and took the face carefully back through the process of mummification.

Certain confirmations appeared of the artists' evidence; these I accepted and retained, especially as they seemed to me to agree with the king's known character. Discrepancies on the other hand could be partly accounted for by the changes in the subject between youth and old age, and partly by the deference due to kings. Finally I did construct a firm scaffolding on which to build my portrait, and so the picture of Sety I was begun.The costume was a simpler problem. One had only to consult the monuments and the jewel-room of the Museum, and to be careful to avoid howlers such as a dinner party parure with a field-service helmet, and so on. Ramses II was next attempted, and I was greatly cheered by the recognition of my resuscitated kings by several eminent archaeologists. Not all the Egyptologists who recognised my portraits realised the method in my madness, the slow sifting of evidence and the laborious brick-making. To many they seemed flights of a fancy only slightly, if at all, controlled by research.

''But one of the most famous of them all, namely Professor Breasted, gave me enormous encouragement. Whatever was to be thought of these particular portraits, he admitted that this was a line of research not hitherto tried, but perfectly legitimate and which might conceivably yield valuable results. His kind words so stimulated me that I made similar attempts with other defunct royalties, and gradually completed the series of kings and queens which appear in these pages.",0

References of above titles are also available on New York site -  http://www.printsasia.com/BookDetails.aspx?Id=445813482
Meanwhile, Can  your good selves in Wiki Project Indian Community re-create a precise pages on [Naresh Sonee] & his book [Brahmand Pujan] – [Brahmaand Pujan] . However,  Sonee is the writer of  this  book  [Brahmand Pujan] written in 1999 . registered with Government of India- HRRD. Details of the registration is provided here on http://brhmaandpujanbook.tripod.com/  .  More than sufficient, news and reviews  are there on http://brhmaandpujan-news-reviews.tripod.com/       
Since 5-6 yrs,  for one or the other reason pages of [Naresh Sonee] & [Brahmand Pujan] are faced by communal bias from outside India  so these articles over and again get deleted here in Wikipedia for minor reasons. However, many hits of - Naresh Sonee reflects on google search engine also. So, I request Wiki Indian community to kindly come forward and generously help these two pages to grow, as I am fed up to fight my case alone here [left] and moved out long back. Meanwhile, such an important  info/issue on ‘Indian literature’  which adds & spell  ‘new meaning /dimension’  to Brahman -should it stay lost else ignored? Your community panel has to judge at last.
Myself, will not be on Wikipedia, for the same i apologise, but- pls. help these two pages to get reinstalled, reap, sow and  grow, if you too feel so, I appeal to do this munificent favour. Regards-",0

CBDunkerson,
I hope this comment on my own talk page is not considered intervention. (I see I've been unblocked.)

I did not mean to suggest that MONGO was purposely inserting information as part of his job. The only reason I said """"I would not be surprised"""", is because this has been going on for a while now and Wikipedia has not stopped it. What else am I to think? (Although I admit to not being familiar with Wikipedia's procedures.) Still, that comment by me is nothing compared to what MONGO's been getting away with.

(Also just noticed this btw.)

Wikipedia is supposed to be NPOV which is why MONGO should steer clear of the 9/11 pages.

An examination of the exchanges between MONGO and myself here is a good example:

MONGO seems content with personal attacks: """"who cares how many misguided folks there are"""".

His comments are clearly ad hominem personal attacks towards me, and many others.

The following, from this page, shows he's content with namecalling as well. I removed an external link to a namecalling site, MONGO reverts me leaving the following statement: I like this weblink...it summaries things quite well

I apologize for any insinuations on my part, but also must stress my own attempts at a NPOV.

I'm sure we all agree, from MONGO's own statements here that he is neither apologetic nor neutral:

""""The POV pushers that try to add nonsense to the articles related to the 9/11 events have been told repeatedly that the vast majority of their """"contributions"""" to those article violated numerous policies. This doesn't seem to stop them. This editor I blocked routinely reverts those that support the concensus verison and yes, conspiracy theorists is what they are...they are not researchers. Simply put, and I won't apologize for this not being more civil, I will continue to block POV pushers that disrupt the discussion pages and the articles with nonsense. Two other admins responded to the unblock request and did not unblock this editor. I then moved the early parts of this conversation from an article talk page to here for all to see. It is ludicrus to assume that I was doing anything other than to ensure that the POV pushers of nonsense know that there is a limit to the level of disruption that needs to be tolerated.""""

If MONGO calls this paper, which has been peer reviewed by two physicists before being accepted for publication in a book, """"nonsense"""", obviously he is not NPOV

In fact, the army has already accepted the Arjun for introduction into service, based upon its driving and firing performance over the years. After firing trials in summer 2006, the trial report (written by the army) said: """"The accuracy and consistency of the Arjun has been proved beyond doubt.""""

The ongoing trials in Pokhran that the army is citing are Accelerated Usage cum Reliability Trials (AUCRT). In these, two Arjun tanks were run almost non-stop for 3,000 kilometres, not to judge performance, but to evaluate the tank's requirement of spare parts, fuel and lubricants during its entire service life.""""

 Deletion of the SKA band The Steadys 

The addition does meet your requirements.  The bass player from The Steadys (Ani Schempfe a.k.a. DJ On-E) joined the pop group Dee-Lite in 1993 after The Steadys broke up.  This fits with you requirements if I'm not mistaken.  The Steadys are also on a live album called NYC SKA LIVE which was released in 1990, so there is physical proof (Recorded media) and this I believe also fits your requirements.  Thank you!

Thanks for getting back to me. I share your """"opinion that we should point out clearly and repeatedly that both Republicans and Democrats are clearly to the right of the demographic center,"""" and I agree it seems like a minority opinion in the mass media. But I still view it as a neutral opinion. With this view, the idea that """"the Democratic Party is almost evenly divided between left-of-center liberals and more centrist moderates"""" seems irrelevant in the lead of an American Left article. I thought that text written in the prefaces to the Encyclopedia of the American Left might hold sway over other editors by serving to dispel disagreements about the scope, lead, and the most important subdivisions of topic. That might be the case in German Wikipedia, and I think it's the case here in science and history articles, but, in politics, perhaps no academic authority can ever hold sway over editors here. This means that even the foundational defining terminology of US politics articles like this one with a potentially ambiguous scope might never be stable. But I respond easily to baiting, I bait other editors myself, I can be sarcastic, and I'm an infrequent (but confident) contributor. If the article is improving now, then it's probably best for someone like me to just shut up. But if what I wrote makes sense to you, there may be a real opportunity there at the moment for your NPOV-ish minority opinion to count for a lot.

First, NPOV is only violated by you. Why do you say """"of course"""" (as EU brings nothing good) and if you look e.g. to England or Poland, most parties are Anti-EU (which does not mean, they want immediately a withdrawal), and that's """"of course"""". It are simply facts. Most parties in Europe are Anti-EU, but even if not, why would that be a reason not to mention the parties who speculate about withdrawal?? And why would non-winning in elections be a reason not to mention them?? They seek EU Withdrawal or a major reform or opt-outs for their nations. But as you say, you don't want they have weight, because you simply do not tolerate other opinions about the EU and wanna have your LibDem-Pro-EU-Opinion (which is anyway evil) in the article and undermine the parties who want real freedom and independence (though in fact, we Anti-EUists do not have opinions, but knowledge). Second, all that would give WP a very bad name, which you don't wanna, though it has anyway a bad name yet as WP is a non-neutral center-left pro-EUSA propaganda platform. But you may be right with the fact, that the party-lists are already better explained in the article Euroscepticism (while """"Euroscepticism"""" is also rather a pro-EU valuating name, better would be """"Eurocriticism"""" or """"Anti-EUism"""") which would but not be a reason to delete the lists, but to delete this whole article and simply redirect to Euroscepticism and transfer the other information.

Holocaust Denial?

Having read and re-read this article, I cannot understand why this section of the Jared Taylor biography even exists for several important policy-related reasons.

First, there is the policy issue of undue weight. It would be understandable that this section existed if Jared Taylor is known for his anti-Semitism or (more importantly) finds himself being the subject of journalists who cover his alleged Holocaust denial. After all, Wikipedia is a terciary source that relies on publicly verifiable secondary sources that document subjects in a NPOV fashion. The fact is, after checking Factiva, Lexis-Nexis, Google News, and JSTOR I cannot find a single article in a reliable mainstream source that associates him with Holocaust denial. Furthermore,  even the Anti-Defamation League does not accuse Taylor of such things. Right away, the alarm bells should start to sound based on those two facts and we should start scrutinizing a  little more carefully what is and is not relevant for this biography.

I'm not suggesting that inconvenient facts and criticisms found in reliable sources cannot be included in this article. I simply have not found them. As it is written now, I think what we have is clear violation of Wikipedia's undue weight policy in a living person's biography.   

Second, speaking of biographies, there is the all-important policy points for  writing biographies of living persons. Specifically, we are told to """"do no harm."""" Is it harmful to create an entire section on Tayler's alleged """"Holocaust denial"""" based on one journalist's question and Taylor's one-line response? To be honest, I think it is.

Reid Stowe is something of a media darling at http:goodnewsbroadcast.com; the material there may be of some use, but I found it to be light on content and long on good feelings.
Coverage of his activities from 2003 to 2007 is spotty; the New York Times seems to have lost interest in him.
I haven't tracked down real basic stuff yet: such as his exact date of birth.
surmised from the (removed blacklisted external). The Jan 08 2007 blog entry notes his birthday party on the previous day.
I've found few sources critical of Stowe; this causes me to raise one eyebrow. Good strong print references are presently hard to come by; Mr. Stowe is a bit of a media darling, and available material reflects that.  
Update:
Nothing in the article on his career as a fine artist. The project blog does make reference to sold paintings, but I don't have references yet documenting whether a gallery represents him or who has purchased his work recently. http://www.reidstowe.netfirms.com/ pesumably has some information, but is usually beyond its delivery capacity.
In 2005, Reid Stowe made a CD with S B, Reid and Suzanna The Bloodlines Some detils at CDBaby and International Herald Daily News. According to the first link, S.B. considered being a part of Mr. Stowe's crew, but decided against it for greatly differing """"philosophy’s and basic moral standards.""""  

Removed from the main article by  

Prison

Reid was arrested in Manhattan and extradited to Maine in 1991.  Reid's trial is public record via Docket #91-2365. His release from federal prison is documented via the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, but no details are given.

I do not claim that this is false, but I have reason to doubt that it is about the Reid Stowe of this article. Mr Stowe of this article was born January 7, 1952; he would have been in his early forties at the time of this release, not 55. Unless (and until) this can be documented unambiguously, WP:BLP compels its removal. To quote: we must get it right. This addition is not sufficiently documented for me to conclude that with confidence.  

If you read the documentation on the Bureau of Prisons web site, the age refers to the prisoners current age; not the age when he was released.  
 Granted, anon, the record is certainly about Reid Stowe. But what sort of story does this record support? The Bureau of Prisons itself asks us to note that an entry in the BOP locator database does not necessarily mean the person has",0

Space disposal
I've been on a rampage today, looking for stuff that needs to be completely redone. So I rewrote the section on space disposal. It no longer contains any speculation on the feasibility of space disposal using technology that hasn't been created yet. More importantly, it now refers to a reliable source. I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings but it really needed to go.   
Thanks. These are people who nearly had seizures when we launched Cassini at Saturn with a few kg of Pu-238 in it. Even if we had a magical propulsion system for launching actinides into space for free, I doubt that politically people would tolerate the booster failure risk rate. If 1% of these things are going to fail and go into the ocean, why not just include the other 99% as well, while we're at it? ;). At least if you pick your spot, you can drop casks into ocean crustal subduction zones (which has been suggested).

 Claims of Non-Neutrality from the Non-Neutral, a.k.a., Double-Standards for Darwin 

Hello,

I'm writing to report a case of non-neutrality from the user . After editing the page on Irreducible complexity to make it more neutral, my changes were reverted, and I received the following message from the aforementioned user:

Welcome to Wikipedia, and thank you for your contributions. One of the core policies of Wikipedia is that articles should always be written from a neutral point of view. A contribution you made to Irreducible complexity appears to carry a non-neutral point of view, and your edit may have been changed or reverted to correct the problem. Please remember to observe this. Thank you. ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community. To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science SÆdon 

I'm fairly new here to Wikipedia, but I understand the basic rules regarding article editing, particularly involving mandatory neutrality. I'm confident that none of my additions were non-neutral in any way which biased the article. They were criticisms of criticisms of irreducible complexity  precisely the sort of thing expected for a neutral, fair-and-balanced article on irreducible complexity. Surely neutrality requires that both arguments for and against controversial ideas be presented, no? What the actions of SÆdon and the other watchdogs of any article involving the Darwinian evolution vs. intelligent design controversy say is that only one side of the issue, theirs, deserves to be presented. This is textbook neutrality  exactly what Wikipedia strives to avoid.

Notice the non-neutrality in Saedon's message:

ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community.

This is an example of either dishonesty of ignorance on Saedon's part. Intelligent design is one of the hottest topics in science today precisely because it is taken seriously by the so-called """"scientific community."""" They take it seriously because it's a very powerful, evidence-based argument that poses a great threat to the current orthodoxy, Darwinian evolution. This is why Saedon and the like watch over any and all articles regarding this debate, making sure they remain heavily biased towards Darwinian evolution, while reverting both arguments for I.D. and criticisms of criticisms against I.D., as happened in my case.

To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science

To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community views I.D. as pseudoscience is a factual statement. While they may be in the minority, there are many members of the scientific community who agree wholeheartedly that I.D. is science. To close your eyes, shove your fingers in your ears, and pretend that these scientists do not exist  as Saedon has done  is intellectual dishonesty. To then permeate Wikipedia with that intellectual dishonesty is unacceptable. Notice, too, Saedon's non-neutral opinion that intelligent design is theology, rather than science.

I refute that claim.

I'm atheist regarding the Gods of any organized religion, and yet I fully accept the scientific-basis of intelligent design. It's no more theological than is big bang cosmology, or even its counterpart, Darwinian evolution. While all three views may have (a)theistic implications, the argumentation and observation behind all three are strictly secular and scientific. For Saedon to baldly assert that intelligent design is theology, and use this bald assertion to further justify his non-neutrality, watchdog-like behavior is unacceptable.

I expect this situation to be dealt with accordingly; fairly, without bias, and absent bald assertions and loaded claims that encourage, if not outright justify, that bias.

Thank you.

 Please read, and in your case disprove, the theory before making a conclusion. 
Please read reliable sources and explain how the NU Journal of Discovery passes the test.   
 Sorry, I forgot who we are dealing with here, the Arrogant Science Party. How do you propose the theory should be linked to this topic, so people can read about alternative views? 

It isn't a theory. A theory is a scientifically acceptable body of principles that explain phenomena in a reasonable manner. People can read alternative views in thousands of blogs, pseudoscience pieces (books, movies, internet). They have no place in an encyclopedia that relies on reliable, verifiable sources. Cheers   

Your definition is incorrect. Einsteins theory of relativity wasn't accepted at all when he presented it, but it was still a quite valid theory. History is full of people rejected by people with your attitude...   

To be quite honest, were not as stupid as people back in the 15th century. We can actually prove these things with exploration and tests. They couldn't. The world CANNOT explode as a result of Global Warming. Its alot tougher than all these enviromentalists give it credit for, however we can't. It would take some extreme heat to cause any harm to the planet. Just because CO2 levels are at there highest in 20 odd million years doesn't mean the earths getting hotter. It means that we're making CO2. Before, there was nothing to add more CO2 to the atmosphere. Now theres us, and the increase is small but its still the highest in 20 million years. Unless we find a way to turn the air into a thick layer of greenhouse gases, the earth will never heat up more than 10 or so degrees, no matter how long you wait. Its physically impossible, as is the earth exploding. Don't bring crack-pot theories into the equation with unreliable sources, and get your facts straight )  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

Please disprove this theory or I will include it.;-)  Then I suggest you read the Wiki on """"Scientific theory"""" to find out what a theory actually IS.  The IDEA that """"global warming"""" could heat the core enough to cause iron to """"explode"""" (chemical explosion?  Deflagration?  Fusion?  Fission?

I see precious little about his father at all, and made sure to look for some that would counter what was said on air before making any changes.

Again, since you seemed to have missed it above, I didn't """"run"""" here to add the information. I only ran across this page in searching for what else Jonah had been in.

Since you listened to the show yourself, you should know exactly what I'm speaking of. The fact you don't even acknowledge this, has me wondering about your motives.

The only reasons I can think of for anyone to rebut what I've said, considering that I'm only relating what was said, is that Jonah's family prefer this not to be public, which I'd respect, or that people are just trying to support the character of Fez as a person.

"If articles supporting Islam aren't permitted, those devoted to criticizing it shouldn't be either. If an article can represent both views (Views On Islam, maybe), that'd be something. If the 'generic' Islam/Islam-related articles do represent a positive image of Islam, then they're not NPOV and need to be corrected. The tone was supposed to be neutral. By the way, I don't see the Islam article listing every positive comment or opinion ever voiced regarding Islam, the way this article documents so many negative ones. No, I'm fairly convinced this article shouldn't be here at all. Because of the title, only negative views regarding Islam can be documented, followed perhaps by responses to those criticisms. Pope John Paul II's positive words on Islam or Muhammad wouldn't fit here, nor would those of anyone else, Muslim or Non-Muslim, who've ever expressed a positive view of Islam that wasn't a response to criticism. That makes this article POV-biased at its core. I don't particularly know Amin or Merzbow, and I'll assume good faith until I know them better. I do know several of the players who frequent pages dealing with Islam or Muslims, and I know their intentions are malevolent. Articles such as these serve as a platform for their Islam-bashing.

Your criticism of Steben’s 2010 paper, “The Philosophy of Music and Ritual in Pre-Han Confucian Thought” http://www.academia.edu/1929545/The_Philosophy_of_Music_and_Ritual_in_Pre-Han_Confucian_Thought_Exalting_the_Power_of_Music_in_Human_Life) for not using the word “criticism” is as unsupportable as your insistence on the word “theory.” Lest we devolve into absurd arguments about the definition of “criticism,” In general, the word is defined as “The action of criticizing, or passing judgment on the qualities or merits of anything….” (The Philological Society, ed. The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol II C, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1970, p.1181). With regard to music specifically, “The Oxford Companion to Music” defines it, in specific regard to music, as: “…the intellectual activity of formulating judgments on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres.”(Latham, ed. Oxford University Press, 2002, p.324) Steben’s paper then clearly describes Confucius’ criticism. As another example, WP’s article on Yayue refers to Confucius’ writing: “The term yayue itself first appeared in the Analects,[2][3] where yayue was considered by Confucius to be the kind of music that is good and beneficial, in contrast to the popular music originated from the state of Zheng which he judged to be decadent and corrupting.[4][5] Yayue is therefore regarded in the Confucian system as the proper form of music that is refined, improving, and essential for self-cultivation, and one that can symbolize good and stable governance.[6][7] “ The Analects contain music criticism whether the word “criticism” appears or not. I think you may be the only person around who thinks otherwise. In the future, if you make assertions like, “You claim that """"Confucius' Analects is, in regard to music, criticism""""; but the reference that you quote in support of your claim utterly fails to actually support it, because it merely never speaks of criticism,” please cite a reference to support your argument. Your continuing argument that a thing cannot be accepted as theoretical unless it specifically uses the word “theory” is similarly problematic because it is not supported anywhere that I can find.

 Original author and valid reference 

Hi. I responsible for the making of the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), and I also freely gave them away to WIkipedia commons.

The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and in the same time include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
And honestly, do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including the research?

According to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my work as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.

Consensus means that every body must agree and I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether the people who are continuously deleting my reference are making a terribly wrong and stupid act? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and other contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text, see below!!

Just as a point of clarification, I think we all have to keep in mind the difference between a reliable result and a valid claim.  I don't think it would be possible to claim that g is not a reliable result - as Bpesta said, it's been replicated far too many times to say it's just an artifact.  The debate is over what this reliable result means (e.g. which theoretical claim about the underlying cause of the effect is valid), and that is a complex, multi-sided, yet-to-be-resolved-if-ever question.  Frankly, I doubt science will have a decent answer to that question until it has a more analytic definition of what intelligence is (and being a bit of a developmentalist myself, I suspect that that definition will be much more subtle than can be captured by a simple measure like IQ), but as it stands, the best we are going to be able to do with this section is discuss g in its basics,and then lay out various interpretations with proper attributions, so that it doesn't look like the section is advocating any one amongst the several competing ideas.

The research originated in 1990 and was published in 2001. The only thing I do now is correct the misleading element in the article, and provide the reader (and you as editors) with a condensed reasoned statement, that you again can check by using the logical faculties of your minds. Also, the verifiability page mentions that the sources should be unreliable. Well, again this is a non-issue for this paragraph. For, the point is that a reasoned argument is provided, so that it doesn't matter where it is from, and you have to use the faculties of your minds. If the washing lady says 1+1=2 then this has the same value as when the bishop says so, even when the bishop doesn't know what he talks about. Which is exactly why I added the suggestion, above, that when the reasoned argument is understood, the criticism might perhaps best be included in the main text, revising the main article. I didn't do that myself, since all of you would be completely shocked, not having digested that reasoned statement. Some other comments: PM 1: I doubt whether you will find many other sources on criticism other then I already included in the list of literature in the links that I provided. If someone feels like unpacking those links and transferring those references into the main body, feel free to do so. PM 2: Now that Rob has eliminated that one sentence, that he agreed was nonsense, perhaps the header Criticism is too strong, and it may be perhaps Evaluation or something like that. PM 3: If the consensus is that this group of editors cannot take responsibility for using their logical faculties of minds on the reasoned argument, then you may also attribute it to me, see Colignatus at wikinfo, and perhaps research a bit how reliable I am. Simply a Google scolar is not enough, though. PM 4: If all this fails, I would like a comment from someone who follows the logic of the reasoned argument and have suggestions how it can remain available for readers, then in another format or place.",0

 discussions ongoing to establish conventions in some eastern civilizations 

hi
I observed that you have contributed to the discussion about article headings for Japanese monarchs and royals. It seems that these weeks, there are attempts to standardize such issues at several spots. One example is whether to standardize Thai royal persons. Of course, Thai and Japanese are totally different, for example regarding the need of disambiguation etc, and should probably be as separate as Eastern are in relation to european royalty naming. I think Japanese naming and Thai naming could end up to different conventions, and that is good if there are sufficient reasons for that. However, discussions may give new ideas and/or give reinforcement and more arguments for existing reasoning.

Reading the above and looking at the editing history, it seems to me that the whole issue turns on whether  accepts the concept of the analogue signal requirement of being continuous or not.  Since I am an engineer in the Aerospace industry, I though I would draw an analogy from that industry, that illustrated the point.  I was surprised to find that the analogy was turned on its head as will be revealed.  Every reference book I checked made the point that the analog signal had to be continuous (It was even in my Uni notes).  But to the analogy.  

The Harrier aircraft uses mechanical wire linkages from the joystick to the control surfaces (elevator, ailerons & rudder).  This is, of course unarguably an analogue signalling system.  The wire linkage forms a continuous signal, and the control surfaces move in smooth continuous steps.

The Typhoon aircraft, in contrast, uses a digital system.  The position of the pilot's joystick is digitised into a number which gets mashed around a bit by a computer.  The resultant digital signal is then fed to the control surface via what is essentially a stepper hydraulic system.  Both the signals and the movement of the control surfaces are described in all the manuals as digital, in spite of the bit size of the numbers being large enough that the movement may appear to be smooth to the pilot.

The surprise was that in the preamble notes (the part of the manual given to new starters as part of their training), the operation of the digital control contained an explanetary analogy where the system was likened to """"... a clock with analogue hands where the movement of the hands is in fact discontinuous and hence, not really analogue at all.""""

In the subject context, the movement of the hands on a clock that has discontinuous movement (i.e. the majority of clocks) is not analogue and  is wrong to continue to insist that it is.   """,0

 What I addad 

The below was liked. If someone wants to chop this down and add it, be my guest. ~   

In 2012, the Journal of Palestine Studies was forced to translate and publish a 1937 letter of David Ben-Gurion after the pressure group CAMERA reported an error made in a journal article written by Pappé. In his article, Pappé had written, """"Ben-Gurion, for example, wrote in a letter to his son in 1937, 'The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war, citing pages 167–68 of David Smith's 2004 Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict. After checking Smith's book for the quote, CAMERA noticed that there had been an error in citation, and wrote to JPS saying so: """"the quote attributed to Ben-Gurion does not appear in the citation provided."""" The JPS verified this, but in doing so highlighted something that CAMERA had not:

The JPS, for its part, does not mention that the paperback version of Pappé's book, certainly at least the 2011 reprint, uses (p. 23) the quote with the same mark positioning as the JPS article—""""The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war."""" The paperback provides different sources to the Smith citation used in the journal article, though: """"Ben-Gurion's Diary, 12 July 1937, and in New Judea, August–September 1937, p. 220.""""

Having uncovered these citation errors and discrepancies, the journal decided to go the final step and have the entirety of Ben-Gurion's letter translated into English. The translated letter confirms that, regardless of citation errors, the underlying interpretation of the letter provided by Pappé's article and book was sound. In the letter to his son, Ben-Gurion is quite clear: """"We must expel Arabs and take their place.""""""",0

 Process definitions 

As a Wikipedia user with no specific knowledge of comic collecting, I find the Process table confusing. It is stated that CGC grades material from 0.5 to 10, then Definitions defines what A, P, S, M and E denote, but below that is given an example grading """"VF/NM 9.0"""". I'm going to induce that NM is near mint, but am I to guess what VF is or why it is there? 121.45.247.24  

Good point. The numbers correspond to more traditional descriptive grades such as """"fine"""", """"very fine"""", """"near mint"""", and """"mint"""". I've added a sentence explaining that and a link to the chart on their website. Also, I removed the """"VF/NM"""" part from the example. Does that make it more comprehensible?   

 Missing an obvious and major criticism 

One of the most obvious criticisms is that the CGC practice is the ultimate objectification and de-artification of the comic/magazine being graded, because it is sealed permanently and will never be read/viewed again except for the cover. All of the story and interior art are essentially lost forever for all intents and purposes.  One might as well just encase it in Lucite like a bug in amber. — ''''''   Talk⇒ ʕ(Õلō)ˀ  Contribs. """,0

Mo survives due in no small part to the fact that none of his mates ever had the good fortune of getting away with a mid-life secret change of identity, as well as the general cowardice of people like BWilkins, who usually run a mile rather than deal with something complex like GAMEing on Irish republican related articles. Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.

This change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.

So here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this. So well done guys. Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass.

"To the original topic, Kittybrewster, I realize that this is your topic area of greatest interest, but I've been thinking about a good answer, and the best I can come up with is this: we're both wasting time here. It seems at the end of the day, I'm convinced that both you and Vintagekits are to blame for a series of Wikipedia-as-battleground incidents, and you do not. From where I sit however, when he went straight to his old battleground, you welcomed him back in kind - and the fact is on Wiki experienced users are expected to do better than that. Some sort of attempt at peacemaking is best, or some sort of dialogue or somesuch. When you ran straight to an admin and then AN/I to get the topicban reinstated, it showed me that you are not interested (probably because you believe it is impossible) in working together with Vintagekits - and possibly others who share his viewpoint. You see it as more Vintagekits' fault, but from my chair, you're both beyond the cutoff. Please remember, my job is to not create parity, equity, equality, or even justice, though I flatter myself and think I can produce it in my own life on occasion. No, I am an administrator not a philosopher-king, and at the end of the day Wikipedia needs no one, not you, Vintagekits, or I, more than it needs a productive working environment as a whole.

When I was involved with Vintagekits' topic ban, at the previous round with the Baronets and troubles bans, I can tell you that they worked to great effect, maintaining him in a topic of interest - despite his protestations of injustice. I hope you can find something you're interested in as well outside your original main content. Try stretching outwards a little - perhaps the history of the British Parliament as a whole, and our articles on parliamentary procedure need to be updated badly and are Americentric. I sincerely hope you good luck in your endeavors.",0

Anma seriously you really have some issues that need to be addressed. Although I have spoken to other editors, they have been professional and helpful whereas you have been incredibly insulting, plus your behavior is considered harassment (even if Wikipedia defines it differently, I know and trained in these matters and this does qualify, and at the end of the day that will overrule any website). Somehow you always seem to be on top of things should a change be made on the YCDTOTV page. Which leads me to think you are indeed watching the page, and you are probably the original author and a huge fan of the show, and you don't like the idea of someone else coming in and editing or adding on to your work. I'm sorry but you are behaving like a bully. You're right my comment was not a threat, but it is a warning not necessarily for Wikipedia but for the real world. At some point someone will put their foot down and say enough is enough this behavior is inappropriate and there will be consequences. You can't act like this it is called a power trip. Also think about it for a second if you look at our past disputes it normally is because I have made multiple changes on multiple pages, so maybe the Amyas """"update"""" was just a small snafu as I did not touch anything else.

"{reply to:Midnightblueowl}Thanks and I completely agree, in future I reckon additions to the UKIP infobox definitely ought to be debated somewhere first, this party's beliefs are clearly a contentious issue. Indeed, this is, in my view, down to the fact all mainstream British parties (left and right) nowadays seem to have become obfuscated and tergiversating in this respect, an alienating nimbus of lies and dishonesty hanging prominently above British politics.
I think I was pushing it with British nationalism (I admit my zealous and brash pursuit of a place for it on the page was inadvertently due to bias, I am a communist and strongly against the whole of the political right) and the source was tenuous for that point.

I’m not disagreeing the fact that Hulk Hogan, let alone anyone, having a belt hanging up on their walls. I believe all the wrestlers have at least a replica of some sorts of all the titles they ever won. I remember seeing John Cena’s, Trish Stratus’s, and Chyna’s homes with a title belt hanging in their respective walls. I also recall Mick Foley mentioning that he has an “Attitude” version of the old WWF title in his closet. In the case with Hogan, he might actually have the real WCW title in his possession. He is only the greatest “Sports Entertainer” ever. I do mean ever!! However, I’m talking about the title, not the belt. I know that “possession is 9/10 of the law"""", but in this case, having the physical belt doesn’t make you a champion. Think about Rhyno and the older version of the ECW title.

I have added the necessary qualification.  Regarding the original lead, it was a mess. Amongst other things the original lead had redundancies, it employed terms without first defining them or linking to a definition, sometimes the term """"compound"""" was used and other times """"statment"""" was used, the relatively minor matter of material implication vs. logical entailment was too long, used an awful example and just confused what preceded it.  In the lead it would have been sufficient to just say something like: """"The material conditional is to be distinguished from logical entailment (which is usually symbolosed using [double turnstile].""""  The distinction can then be detailed in the body of the article.  Also the failure to even mention propositional calculus  which is the context in which someone is most likely to look up the meaning of the operator  was an unacceptable omission.  By the time someone reaches the study of paraconsistent logical systems they will likely have no need to look up what a material conditional is on Wikipedia.  A novice is most likely to look up this entry in wikipedia and they will most likely have encountered the operator in the context of classical/Boolean propositional calculus.   """,0

HI. These are exciting times are they not? What I had in mind two years ago on here seems to be gradually taking shape. The project is better and more organised than ever.

If we can add such content en masse which are of s similar standard this project will devleop massively. Some day we'll have every notable film from every country, and up to a half decent standard (hopefully). I;m keen to encourage editors to edit Latin American film although this seems to be a sadly neglected part of films on here. I;ve proposed a new project but I doubt I'll get anybody to follow it as most interested editors are likely to be working on spanish wikipedia aside from the one or two film buffs we have on here.

BARBARO

I left some comments on F550's talk page. I think how Wikipedia has treated this F550 and the Barbaro family was unfair. I also noticed that this individual seems to have just tried to edit his name out of those two bogus societies, which seems fair to me, and Wikipedia editors keeps bringing it back. It seems like Wikipedia's disregard for others is very cruel. just my thoughts 

I also left some comments too on genio or ganios talk page too 

 Excuse me Gustav, your contribution with adding San Francesco della Vigna was actually not correct. I left a comment for you on Giano's talk page. I think everyone is desperately trying to piece inconsequential tid-bit in hope that something resembling an article might show up. The original version I saw a month ago was just fine and accurate.

Gustav, I just had a chance to look at the history of the Barbaro family page. Why was the article listed as the """"TRUE BARBARO FAMILY ARTICILE..."""" removed. That is the one that should be the official Barbaro family page. It has excellent Zorzi sources and clearly is structured in a not only a factual way, but also a way that captures the true spirit and soul of the family. This aricle that you have replaced it with is crummy.

Why isn't this page flagged """"under construction"""". You gotta be kidding me if this is the official article that is constructed for the great Barbaro family. Please say it isn't so. This has got to be the worst article I have ever seen on Wikipedia. This thing stinks! Usually articles this dinky are flagged as stubs asking for people to expand on them. I think it is time to admit Gustav that you are out of your league. Clearly the person that constructed the former Barbaro family article was an Art Historian that new this family and proper sources well. 

 
 HYPER-INDIVIDUALIST@YAHOO.COM IS IN ON THE HOAX!  

This hyper guy is in on it with Tiki-two. They planned to damage the Barbaro family page all long. First they started bogus societies which they knew would lead to the family page being destroyed. They planned it well. Tiki used the same company computer which would discredit the family's input and this hyper guy stayed out from editing so he would seem clean. But how come the conversation on the secret society talk page is only between Tiki and Hyper. Even his tag looks suspicious, """"Hyper-individualist"""". Watch this guy very closely. I think the Barbaro family needs an I'm sorry. Because I noticed that whenever it seems like the Barbaro page was going to be restored, than all of a sudden Hyper jumped in with Hoax Hoax! Very sneaky and well timed Hyper. I see what is going on. How can anyone discredit all of the evidence that was given in supportfor the family. I get you Hyper. You were the straight man and Tiki played the opposite role, but you are both as guilty-without any doubt! This guy just magically comes across an ebay purchase out of the blue from ebay back records. Yeah right-Ok Hyper!

Peg Entwistle Suicide

In the article it was said that the sign became such a symbol of Hollywood (the film industry, not the town, per se) that Entwistle used it as a symbol in death (slight paraphrase). The article gave the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" as the reference.

I removed the reference and edited the article because the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" is simply wrong. The sign did not become a """"symbol"""" of """"Hollywood"""" until after and because of Entwistle's suicide. I am Entwistle's biographer and the research consultant to a documentary titled """"Under the Hollywood Sign,"""" a look at the last 100 years of history of Beachwood Canyon. In extensive interviews for my book, I have discussed the sign and it's meaning with Peg Entwistle's brother Milton. Milton Entwistle was 11 at the time of his sister's death and remembers very well that the sign was only regarded as a billboardit was never, ever regarded as a symbol of """"The Industry,"""" or """"Tinsel Town,"""" or any other term one may use to describe """"Hollywood"""" the film capitol.

The """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" orginazation has repeatedly rebuffed my requests to accuratly portray the details of the sign's meaning at the time Entwistle died. Furthermore, they have completed perverted the facts of Entwisle's life, career, and death even though I sent them many documents showing their errors.

It should also be noted that the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" is an orginazation committed to the care and maintenance of the sign, they are not the end-all of its history, and they are most certainly not the experts on the life, career, and death of Peg Entwistle.

 Source Material 

Please have links at the bottom to """"witch"""" websites, or wikipedia articles dealing with witches.  Witch Hunter Robin makes a lot of references to the occult that I think it would be helpful if the article covered some of it.  Not all, just enough for more pleasant viewing of the anime.  Obviously most fans of the show are probably into that stuff themselves, and, at the risk of getting into stereotypes, most of them are probably goth chicks or feminist types who like """"strong female leads,"""" e.g. Robin Sena, the main character.  Nevertheless, a substantial number of people, otakus or new fans to Anime, I think would apreciate it, if anime articles would cover whatever references an anime uses.  One of the things I find most annoying about Wikipedia anime articles is that they do not cover references enough.  For example; Shura No Toki is full of historical references, yet, the article on that anime on Wikipedia does not cover it.  Furthermore, for the anime """"Gilgamesh,"""" some background, however brief as needed, would be helpful regarding semitic mythology, not to mention """"remedial"""" quantum physics, as the anime makes extensive use of them.  Without semitic mythology, and a basic understanding of quantum physics, """"Gilgamesh"""" is unwatchable.  You have to be a Jewish college student majoring in Physics, or someone who has read extensively about Judaism and Physics, to understand what the hell is going on.  Ghost in The Shell, similarly, it uses so much computer jargon, part of the reason it has only RECENTLY become popular, is because computer jargon has become a part of the cultural lingo.  Before, animes like GITS were very audience exclusive.  For reference please, consider what I said; no need to turn an article into a mini novel, just some brief coverage, or at least links to the themes, science or history the animes touched on.

Chasidei Chabad v. Russian Federation
The case involves the return of alleged texts belonging to Judaica in possession of the Russian government which could end up on the black market. The U.S. Courts have ordered Russia to preserve and return the texts, but Moscow eventually withdrew from the case citing sovereign immunity. As a result of the lawsuit, the Russian Federation has cancelled loans to Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the National Gallery in Washington, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and Houston Museum of Natural Science over the threat the artwork could be seized as reciprocity. In June 2011, the Justice Department filed a notice it would not support the confiscation of Russian artwork on loan as retaliation. (See: """"AGUDAS CHASIDEI CHABAD OF UNITED STATES v.

Flan etc.

Hi, thanks for contributing to the Crème caramel article. I have a few comments which I hope will help you edit this and other articles more effectively.

You have changed 'flan' to 'Flan', arguing that 'flan' is a proper noun. Do you have any evidence for that?  Why is it not a common noun like other names of dishes, e.g. pizza, roast beef, moussaka, etc.?  Do you have any reliable sources backing up your claim?

You have also added vertical whitespace presumably to make the photos format better.  Unfortunately, that method is not reliable  as WP:PIC says, """"Remember that text will flow and wrap differently for other users, based on their chosen browser, screen resolution, default font size, accessibility options, number of toolbars and sidebars (such as instant messaging panes) and more.

From the Wall Street crash 1929, to the non-existent depression of 1946, to the Bretton Woods system, the stagflation of the 1970s, the S&L; crisis of the 1980s, the dot.com bubble of the 1990s and the housing bubble of the 2000s. From Keynes' suggestion to bury FED-notes in glass jars underground and let people dig them up, to Samuelson's insistence on the USSR overtaking the US from the early 1970s to 1989, to Krugman's Space Alien Invasion solution to our present day crisis.
Just to name a few examples of the top of my head. With a track record like that, of course they will shun the one school of thought that get things right, that understand what economics actually is and, more importantly, what it isn't.
It's not the mainstream economists that don't take AE seriously, it's the other way around. For good reason. So excuse me for not being all giggly about your supposed training in economics. Like Jefferson said, you'd be better informed of current events if you didn't read any newspaper at all than if you read those of his day.

I must in all fairness ask what the problem is with “original research? Are you implying that original and authentic research is not appropriate for “Wikipedia”. There is way, way to much trash out there on the “internet” which cannot be, in any way, verified. My additions to the Butler page were not suppositions, rather eyewitness statements as to what really happened to Butler. 

Unfortunately, the webmaster of http://www.nyhistory.net/~drums/wbutler.htm is a personal and friendly acquaintance of mine, but he, and many other historians have bought into the early undocumented histories of the Mohawk Valley, most of which I have spent the last twenty-five plus years trying to authenticate as at least seventeen of my own ancestors fought in the Mohawk Valley during the Revolution, and regurgitated their unbelievable and unverifiable “facts” as their own research.

Please, do not misunderstand: I am not upset, get confused!!! I would really like to see all of the content of the Internet be so reliable that anyone could simply look it up on the web and then contact the repository of the original document, pay the appropriate fee for copying it, and then have their own private library of primary source documents.

Hope this finds all well!

P.S. The “copyrighted material” that I incorrectly posted in Wikipedia was an article entirely of my own production and which was copied from my master copies of the 100+ pages of primary source data on my “www.fort-plank.com” site. This can be easily verified by my publisher, Picton Press, and a plethora of fellow researchers, some of whom agree with me and some who do not.""",0

"How do they pick up the words? 
     You can't use words you don't know.
     Granted, it's very hard nowadays to be sheltered from swearing and cursing, but I'm relieved that in my curiosity I found that the percentage of those with TS who exhibited this is considerably less than half. Because the way the media and others have stigmatized this, it makes it sound like people pick up swear words even if they've never heard them; and that's not possible, language must be learned.
     That brings me to my question, which I think should be part of the topic. How, do those with this pick up the words, and why do they automatically use taboo words? Like, say for instance, I know someone with TS who has never heard ****. He hears it, I act shocked, and so he figures it's taboo. Does the part of his mind that says not to say it then turn off, or what?
     Further, what about someone growing up in an environment where the words are *not* taboo, like some inner cities where every 2nd word is ****? Does this person then *not* say the taboo word becasue where they've grown up, they haven't learned it is taboo?

 Plot: 

The film opens with Lord Voldemort stealing the Elder wand from Albus Dumbledore's tomb and shooting a large bolt of lightning into the sky. It then cuts to Hogwarts which is no longer a colorful castle of magic, but a shadowy concentration camp surrounded by Dementors with the students being marched through the Entrance Courtyard. Severus Snape stands in the top of the castle and watches the students with a blank expression.
At Shell Cottage, Harry Potter sits in front of Dobby's grave, gazing into the one way mirror. He suspects that there is a Horcrux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts so he, Ron and Hermione strike a deal with Griphook: he will get them into Gringotts Wizarding Bank to find the Horcrux if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor, a bargain to which they reluctantly agree. Harry then questions Ollivander, who examines and identifies the stolen wands of Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy. While he confirms that Draco's wand is safe to use, he cautions Harry about Bellatrix's wand, as it is """"unyielding"""" and might be dangerous unless its allegiance has changed. Harry then asks him if he knows about the Deathly Hallows and Ollivander claims he does not think they exist, although Harry knows he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand and is determined to kill Voldemort first.

With Harry and Griphook under the Invisibility Cloak, Hermione disguised as Bellatrix and Ron as a foreign wizard with bushy facial hair, the trio and Griphook apparate to Gringotts. During the first phase of the mission Harry and Ron are forced to use the Imperius Curse on Bogrod to cover up Hermione's unsuccessful impersonation of Bellatrix. They manage to get into the vault despite their disguises being removed by The Thief's Downfall, and inside the vault they find Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, the Horcrux, but set off the Geminio curse, causing everything they touch to multiply exponentially. Griphook takes the sword from them after they get the cup, saying that he never said he would help them get out, only in. He runs for it and calls security, the trio are almost crushed by the gold and captured but Hermione gets them to jump on the back of a dragon kept as a security measure. Setting the dragon free, it wreaks havoc killing several goblins (including Bogrod), crashing through the roof and flying off with the trio on its back. After jumping off the dragon into a lake, Harry has a vision of Voldemort furiously killing Griphook and many other Gringotts employees and personnel at Malfoy Manor for allowing his Horcrux to get stolen. Choosing to keep Nagini by his side, he summons his followers and orders them to invade Hogwarts to ensure the Horcrux he hid there is still safe.

Having sensed Voldemort thinking of his Horcrux and Hogwarts through their connection, Harry tells the other two they have to go there and destroy it before Voldemort can get to it, and that Voldemort seems to be getting more fragile with each Horcrux destroyed. They apparate to Hogsmeade but immediately trigger alarms set up by Death Eaters, waiting for Harry. The trio are almost captured but Aberforth Dumbledore gets them safely into his home and berates them for coming to the village. Harry discovers that it was him who had been watching them through the mirror shard and him who sent Dobby to rescue them before after seeing the Two-Way mirror hung up on the wall. Aberforth provides them with food and tells them to give up on their mission, go into hiding and save themselves. Harry said that he trusts Dumbledore's judgement that the task has to be seen through no matter what, but Aberforth insists that Albus had left them a suicide mission and it was hopeless. After Harry insisted on finishing what he had started, Aberforth summoned Neville Longbottom through a secret passage behind Ariana's portrait to bring them into Hogwarts. Bruised and beaten by the Death Eaters of the staff, Neville and most of the students have been hiding in the Room of Requirement all year. They welcome Harry in with tremendous applause and jump at the idea of helping Harry finish Voldemort but Harry still doesn't know what the Horcrux looked like or where it was. After saying it might be connected to Ravenclaw, Luna suggests that Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem might be it, despite no one alive today having seen it. Ginny arrives and after gazing at Harry for a moment tells everyone that Snape was now aware of Harry's break in and wanted everyone in the Great Hall.

In the hall, Snape orders anyone who may hold information regarding Harry's location to tell him immediately or face punishment. Harry then reveals himself after hiding within the crowd and rebukes Snape for standing where Dumbledore once stood as Headmaster, ordering him to tell the students the truth of how he betrayed and killed Dumbledore as Order Of The Phoenix members enter the Great Hall.

I'm very careful with the word """"slander."""" I use it to describe slander.  As in, what Qworty posted. Note that """"slander"""" has two senses: one legal, and one informal.

Um, try to interpret this as anything but slander:  """"I think it's going to come out that the only reason she got any books published at all was because her rich daddy was a huge big deal in the publishing world. And the reason she can't get any books published anymore is because her big rich daddy is retired now and no longer a heavyweight at all in that world."""" - Qworty. Not only do I interpret this as slander, but so do sober people on Wikipedia.

This is a long-time editor who is well aware of policy, so suggesting that he/she step back was appropriate as a first step to diffuse the drama, and I see that the next step I expected, of asking the editor to remove the material him/herself, has been done at User talk:Qworty#BLP concerns by a well-respected admin. But policy calls for the material to be removed either voluntarily by its author or by any editor, as we have an obligation to not defame our subjects, even in the heat of argument."""" For what it's worth, the word """"defamatory"""" is in fact a legal designation.

The primary goal of the case based textbook is to inform doctors of what to do when they are asked to perform different medical operations. The case based textbook only has one chapter on circumcision. Its primary goal is to inform doctors of how to react in the case they are asked to perform a circumcision. It does not give an overview of questions that have been raised about the procedure, and doesn't cover sources of controversy in the medical field (only debates). This makes it unfit to speak for this topic. Maybe it would be better to use it to highlight another statement involving controversies in the medical field.

The second source titled Controversies with one author is ok, as it does go over some medical controversies that exist, notably in consent and the parental role.

I think a better sourcing for this statement """"Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and autonomy have been raised over non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.[8][9]"""" would be one that highlights significant questions from community groups in a specific demographic. If we could get a source that is clearly indicating that these questions are being raised that would be better.

Hi, thanks for the invite ... I see from your page that you are """"semi-retired"""" ... so am I. I plink on occasional articles but hardly have a """"watchlist""""  too time-consuming/exhausting.  

I am very annoyed that WP doesn't have a system to keep out idiots like User:Aboutmovies, above.  The guy comes in, vandalizes an article he knows absolutely nothing about, provokes an argument, and then goes on his merry way.  Now, I'm an idiot too, and have probably embedded hundreds of mistakes into WP articles... but these were accidental, and not brazen ... 

I'd like to see a system that allows factions such as WP:WPM or WP:WPCS to put a """"seal of approval"""" on certain versions of an article.  The idea is that ordinary users can make edits, but only subject-matter experts can place a """"seal of approval"""" on the latest version.  This would help keep """"subtle vandalism"""", such as that by 'Aboutmovies', at bay.   """,0
"resignation 

After months of contributing to this site I have finally had enough of its petty, pathetic, idiotic rules and guidelines! Firstly on the article the fog you try adding just a few things and some complete wanker goes and starts undoing it all, just because it's  not what they think is right. Then you get told about a load of rules and guidelines for pitty sake. Why are there rules and guidelines on a free editing site? But worst of all why do some of the stupid editors think they are in government!?!? They think they are all great and powerful but really they're weak and pathetic! 

After all that I had been defeated by a few idiots, so I left it if they want to be that stupid let them. I had been editing George of the jungle 2 for some time but all my work had been undone, I can only think the editor went through my contributions to see what I had been doing. I tried coming to a solution with them but again it was ignored. So because they were determined to have their way I had to let them. This is the sort of thing that goes on a lot and I have had enough. I won't try and contribute as it either goes against what someone thinks is right or goes against some poxy rule! Well what a shit site! Also saying my English is poor, well George of the jungle 2 starts a sentence with anyway for crying out loud!!! I'm done bye thanks for nothing .",1

 I respect your logic behind moving the Khalifman quote from Methods for comparing top chess players throughout history to World Chess Championship 2010. I do however wish to bring your attention back to what was my original intent. I have observed this page frequently. Few years ago, I started wondering as to what is the acceptable time period for this page to remain hostage to the old statistics of Jeff Sonas, Raymond Keene, Nathan Divinsky, Matej Guid and Ivan Bratko. More recently I observed many past players (or their protege) beginning to exploit this page to proclaim greatness. My additions were merely an attempt to coerce a reflection on the """"present state"""" because """"Throughout History"""" seems to have stopped at 2005! The elo list only adds to the confusion because it is inflationary in nature. In my humble opinion, the present cathartic state is a bigger violation of encylopedia guidelines then my attempt to update it. Do remember that Wikipedia is visited by more lay people (who will be seriously mislead/confused by the data upto 2005) then experts (who can objectively transpose it to year 2011). A lot of 10 year old kids use Wikipedia to learn and write their homework. It is fine if we want to wait till someone of great repute explicitly compares current players to Fischer or either of the K's, or someone acceptable comes forth with up-to-date statistics beyond 2005. That may happen tomorrow, or may not happen for another 10 years. Till then we can keep our heads buried in sand.   """,0

"Beryllium sphere's purpose

I love this movie (to the extent that we made thermion outfits for a fancy dress once ).  I've always pondered what the beryllium sphere was actually for.  Reading around, a number of possibilities for this are:

 A neutron reflector - beryllium is good for reflecting neutrons.
 A gamma reflector - beryllium is apparently fairly good at reflecting gamma rays too.
 Some kind of inertial system
 Affects the space-time continuum in a way suitable for warp drives.
 High temperature and pressure confinement system.

The reason I wonder is mainly because beryllium is an unusual material and is very toxic to handle, so they NSCA designers must have had some special reasons for such an exotic material.  The fact that an alien race produced a suitable replacement indicates it is practically a commodity in spacefaring communities.  Is there any data connecting the performance of beryllium spheres with that of transparent aluminium?",0

 Peer Review 
I like how you've organized the wiki page. It's very logical, and has a lot of detail, that are all linked to other pages, which is great. 
However (there's more detail in the rest of the post) it would be helpful if you fleshed out your intro, and intros to other sections. Otherwise I have no idea for what information this page has to offer at first glance. The sections themselves are very dense with information, which is good, but it can also be a bit confusing with no diagrams as a visual aide. If you can find some diagrams for sections """"uORFs"""" and """"Reinitation"""" it would be helpful. 

Introduction:
""""differing mechanisms dependent on organism."""" sounds awkward. Also you should provide more detail on the different mechanism
General Structure:
Length: I like the example you give to demonstrate size difference. 

Role in Translational Regulation:
I think it would be helpful if you had a small overview section """"Role in Translational Regulation"""". The section is split up in a very logical way, but it feels a bit disjointed. The overview might help a person approach each section with a greater picture in mind. 
Prok: Is there a page that outlines the mechanism of Prokaryotic Translation? It would be a good idea to link that information to this section. You say """"many other proteins"""" are recruited, which opens the question of the actual process. 
It would be good if you include more details on how 5' UTR can be mutated, and what kind of defects it can lead to. 
It might also be a good idea if you include more information as to what model organisms were used to determine some of the experimental results.

 New review articles on human population genetics based on studies of ancient DNA 

Wikipedia has a lot of interesting articles based on the ongoing research in human molecular genetics that helps trace the lineage of people living in various places on the earth. I've been reading university textbooks on human genetics """"for fun"""" since the 1980s, and for even longer I've been visiting my state flagship university's vast BioMedical Library to look up topics on human medicine and health care policy. On the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate  to build an encyclopedia, I thought I would suggest some sources for improving articles on human genetic history and related articles. The  Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources in medicine provide a helpful framework for evaluating sources. 

The guidelines on reliable sources for medicine remind editors that """"it is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable, third-party, published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge."""" 

The guidelines, consistent with the  general Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources, remind us that all """"Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources"""" (emphasis in original). They helpfully define a primary source in medicine as one in which the authors directly participated in the research or documented their personal experiences. By contrast, a secondary source summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources, usually to provide an overview of the current understanding of a medical topic. The general Wikipedia guidelines let us know that """"Articles should rely on secondary sources whenever possible. For example, a review article, monograph, or textbook is better than a primary research paper. When relying on primary sources, extreme caution is advised: Wikipedians should never interpret the content of primary sources for themselves."""" 

Two review articles in prominent journals about human population genetics are bringing together analysis of the many recent studies of human DNA, including DNA from ancient individuals. 

Earlier studies of this issue were based on more limited samples (fewer genes, and fewer human individuals from fewer regions and only recent times). As more samples of more genes from more individuals from more places and times are gathered, the molecular evidence is making it increasingly clear that human beings have been moving back and forth across the Earth's surface and mixing genes over long distances ever since their earliest ancestors moved out of the human homeland in Africa.   (talk, ) """,0
""":::* I'm not using jabs or insults of any kind.  """"Greek-centric"""" means """"centered on Greece or concerns relating thereto"""". That's an accurate description of the view that things relating to Greece use words (in English) derived from Greek-language Hellas on the basis that Greeks themselves prefer this term. If this were a discussion about Germans wanting everything about Germany to use Deutsche in English too, that would be a German-centric concern (i.a. a concern centered on Germany, Germans, and their preferences).  NB: I actually know Germans who insist that we should stop saying """"German"""" and """"Germany"""" (and that the Spanish should stop using Alemán), and everyone use """"Deutsche"""" and """"Deutschland"""", so, no, it is not a red herring fallacy at all, but a comparison chosen carefully (though not carefully enough; see a bit later). Your own counter however, is a straw man fallacy; no one said anything about transliterating vs. not transliterating, so the """"Ελλάς"""" argument is a complete non sequitur.  I do agree that Hellenic is an English word, and concede the point that the Deutsche comparison wasn't very apt after all; I was focused more on the situational than linguistic similarity when I chose it.  A better example would be expecting our articles about Japan and the Japanese to use Nippon and Nipponese to better match the native name of the country; these are in fact words in English. It would actually make  sense to do that than to do what's been proposed here, because """"Nipponese"""" has no confusing alternative meaning, unlike """"Hellenic"""" which commonly, probably  commonly, refers to ancient Greek culture in English, not modern.  —  ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼

 """"Jesus and Messianic prophecy"""" 

Hey. I don't know if this is technically where I should be posting this; sorry if it's not.

1) Fine, if """"retort"""" isn't 100% appropriate then I'll use """"counter-argue""""- that is the meaning I was trying to get across.

But I think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with Wikipedia's guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general.

2) You said: """"Christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a time-line for the Messiah's actions, and the New Testament, especially the Book of Revelation, detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later. . This is a bit vague and raises some questions. Which Christians? Where did they say that? How did they detail it? Can you reference it from a notable/semi-notable scholar?""""

First, I can't point to a place in the Old Testament where the time-line DOESN'T exist, you know what I mean? There is no Jewish time-line so it cannot be referenced. But the New Testament does have a Christian time-line, as detailed in the Book of Revelation. Now, which Christians hold to this belief? Essentially all of them- all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the Bible, which is essentially all. Where did Christian authors detail this belief? In the Bible! How did they detail it? They wrote it in the Bible!!! That is why I made Bible references! Which scholar can I quote? How about John the Apostle, who wrote Revelation? Is one of the founders of Christianity an acceptable source on the subject?

I find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing, """"Christians believe Jesus came back from the dead, as detailed in various places, including the gospels,"""" and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting Bible passages and asking, """"which Christians believe that?"""". 

3) You said: This includes Jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse (Revelation 19-22). , although it does reference The Bible, if left alone, it sounds rather confusing. It also does not specifically reference a line from Revelation, nor does it reference which version of The Bible it quotes (King James, NIV, etc) which could mean a slight difference in the quote. 

If you want many specific Bible quotes then I'll put those in, and I'll list if its KJV or whatever. But I don't think that's required as my broad citation of Rev 19-22 does clearly explain exactly what I'm talking about, including a physical kingdom on earth, a messianic age of righteousness and so on. Just because I didn't dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesn't mean they aren't there- any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters.

If I had written, """"The story of Noah's Ark is in Genesis 6-9,"""" would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague? Just because I didn't give a synopsis with ten references doesn't mean it's unworthy; just look it up! 

4) What bothers me most is how this whole thing started when I tried to correct incorrect data on your site (the line that Christians don't believe in a physical resurrection). That line had NO references! So even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post, don't they? You can't delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all.

5) I'm sure you'll disagree with me on this one, but most of all, I think that my contribution didn't need to cite ANYTHING as it is such common knowledge that Christians believe in Judgment Day, an age of peace etc. I feel like I'm in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief. 

It's almost as bad as someone posting, """"Christians don't believe Jesus was tried, executed and came back to life,"""" then I post that they do, citing Luke 20-24, then you saying that it is too vague etc. It was pure courtesy to give the citation- it's such common knowledge that Christians believe these things!

But whatever- I'll repost with a several more-specific quotes. And BTW, you may think, """"Whoa, this guy care WAY too much about Wikipedia (and I'm a mod),"""" but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented. (And I hate inconsistency.)

CLASS: Most are from poverty-lower class backgrounds, are products of unstable families, and are abused or neglected.

IQ: Majority in normal range 90-110

EDUCATION: Typically a high school graduate; some college possible; discipline problems likely, most likely involving pornography interest

PEERS: Mild to moderate social maladjustments, but normally one of the """"boys""""; tries to cultivate a reputation as a tough fighter, but known as a punk and low life to many; usually married, divorced, or lives with a women, in that order, but has demonstrated poor relations with women

WORK: Most work reliably around women; lack self-confidence to improve self; if sadistic, takes better job. More than half are unskilled laborers or unemployed.

CRIMINAL HISTORY: Most average 2.5 priors, only 2 years served on each. Most also have history of alcohol-related charges.

ARREST: Frequently leaves clues with victim; plays games with police; difficult to get confession

DRUG/ALCOHOL: Noted problems in this area

MENTAL: Antisocial personality; defines self as normal in every way except sexually.

Again, I disagree. Scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness (particularly for the question of the Roma and the disable). In fact, as you go through modern academic literature (the last 20 years), """"Holocaust"""" more and more includes non-Jewish victims. Just an example: Alex Callinicos, from York University, (2001) The Holocaust isfor good reasons I need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil. All the different kinds of domination fused together in Auschwitzracism, directed at Jews, Slavs, and Roma; the economic exploitation of slave labour; the oppression of gays and women; the persecution of dissenting minorities such as Communists and Jehovah's Witnesses. Or Slawomir Kapralski, """"Identity Building and the Holocaust: Roma Political Nationalism."""" I have already mentioned Sybil Milton (who was a senior historian at the Research Institute of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum), and Henry Friedlander, a leading Holocaust historian in the USA, is another important voice. This increasing consensus has had an impact on common language , as well on political bodies. See this press release from the UN, for instance. It is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist, mordern project, and the common fate of the victims. The famous pictures of Mengele's twins are of Roma children. The technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the T4. The tactics of Eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of Poland, against Polish leaders. I have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of Jews in the Holocaust; I have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.
If this is not enough, let me try in another way: by deciding to describe the Holocaust as an 'exclusive' Jewish event, wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate (I could say on the 'declining' side of an ongoing scholarly debate). this is NOT holocaust denial, with no legitimacy in the academia, and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes.

Thank you for taking my suggestion by coming here to Talk instead of just reverting without explanation. I have indeed reverted some changes by Jayjg.  However, these changes were not actually improvements.  Briefly:
 act-now.org is brought up as an example of how """"circumcision advocacy"""" is a term used by some advocates, whereas Jay's version makes it sound otherwise.  Regardless of the subjective quality of the web site, suppressing any mention of it would be POV, hence unacceptable.  WP:NPOV is not negotiable.
 The definition of circumcision advocacy is accurate and not OR.  If you have some sort of specific complaints, I suggest altering the text instead of removing it.
 The article already mentions masturbation, you would like to omit the relevant and cited fact that masturbation is harmless and NOT prevented by circumcision.  Omiting this would be POV and WP:NPOV is not negotiable.
 Actually, what's reintroduced is the history with regard to advocacy, which is entirely relevant.
In short, these deletions all serve to harm the neutrality and comprehensiveness of the article.  Therefore, I will be forced to continue restoring the text if you attempt to remove it without an acceptable explanation.  Your explanations thus far are not acceptable.

 Saint Peter's Tomb 

OK, the Catholicism tag is part of the Christianity tag because of my trying to integrate all of them. The question of the Vatican City, Rome, and Italy is a good one.

""":Editors,

Thank you for the quick replies! My original thoughts were that it's painfully obvious to any reader that the UK is a country, and that this does not need pointing out  an equivalent example:

""""The United States is a country consisting of fifty states and a federal district.""""
can be reduced, without loss of clarity, to
""""The United States consists of fifty states and a federal district.""""

But very well  I can see that it's been decided to emphasize the UK's status as a country. Fair enough.

GoodDay, Jamesinderbyshire:  You're both very right, of course, but I think there's a chance we could preserve these subtle complexities AND use clear language *at the same time*. Perhaps there is a synonym for country that we can use that would eliminate this awkward wording altogether? I noticed that the """"Four countries of the United Kingdom"""" article uses the term """"sovereign state"""". Would the following work?

""""It is a sovereign state consisting of four countries: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.""""

Alarics: I realize the issue has been discussed before, but I feel that the issue has often been tackled from a political perspective - with pro-devolution/independence editors wanting to de-emphasize UK's status as a unitary state and with nationalists wanting to do the opposite.

I am a Canadian reader, without a lot of knowledge about UK politics or how the country operates. I am approaching this issue purely from a writing/editing perspective. I am simply trying to make this article as *clear and concise* as possible, without losing all the subtle complexities and compromises that various editors have negotiated into the article. I'm certainly not trying to set any new conventions, and I certainly don't want to set off any edit wars.

Hi
Ref to your recent revert at Eight Nation Alliance, please have a look: 100 years old history book  talk """,0
"""

 Hi there! Thank you for your querie about the Humanistic teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. Let me start by saying that the title """"Humanistic Buddhism"""" is rather sematically weak: because there are no 2 types of Buddhism: one Humanistic and another non-Humanistic. I think we should alter the title into """"Buddhist Humanism"""". If you trace the word Humanism you'll find various views: Christian Humanism, secular Humanism...etc... and adding the term """"Buddhist Humanism"""" is appropriate. 

 Secondly, the term Humanistic Buddhism or Buddhist Humanism, whether in China or Japan or the USA, is based on the Buddha's teachings - in particular the teachings of the Lotus Sutra. (The article mentions this clearly). The Lotus Sutra - of course - is not a private property of a certain temple or nation (Chinese, Japanese etc...) Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra is a universal teaching for all Humanity.

Historically, it was TienTai of China who placed the Lotus Sutra as the highest of the Buddha's teachings. Later it was introduced to Japan and the Tendai Sect emerged upholding the Lotus teachings, which was the ground for Nichiren, who appeared in 1222, to declare his teachings based solely on the Lotus Sutra. Currently, a 12 millions Samgha Nichiren Buddhist group (the Soka Gakkai International) is actively working for: """"Spreading Buddhist Humanism in the Community"""" http://www.sgi.org/about-us/members-stories/spreading-buddhist-humanism-in-the-community.html

 Nichiren Buddhism focuses on the Lotus Sutra: “Buddhist humanism:  It is a philosophical perspective that reflects the core spirit of the Lotus Sutra”
Buddhist Humanism: http://www.daisakuikeda.org/main/philos/buddhist/buddh-05.html

 I think it is more accurate and more professional to refer to Buddhism as either Theravada or Mahayana. In China or Japan, you have Buddhist schools which are either Theravada or Mahayana. There is no such thing as """"Chinese"""" Buddhism and """"Japanese"""" Buddhism. Using the term Chinese or Japanese Buddhism is plainly wrong. For example Zen has branches and temples in both Japan & China. It remains Zen. No need here for confusing """"passport"""" added to Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is found all over the world but mostly parcticed in Japan, this does not make it Japanese, but correctly: a Mahayana school based on the Lotus Sutra. It is even not logical to speak about Humanism and Humanity and in the same time restrict Buddhism to artificial national descriptions of  Chinese and Japanese terms. 

 Wikipedia articles must be impartial and must bring various views. Humanistic values of Buddhism cannot be patented to this temple or that priest only. All respect worthy people working to spread Buddhist Humanism must be acknowledged. I am doing research to include the participation of various Mahayana schools in the teachings of Humanism of the Buddha teachings which are for all Humanity. Thank you for your input and let's cooperate to improve the article.   """,0

First, trying to pull """"rank"""" with me, is not an effective way to be persusive with me or to appear as an ally or friendly. Second, you have misread my statement and missed my major point about vagina and penis. The point is that the article itself explans that a vaginoplasty is surgery to create a vagina. It is therefore obvious that any photographs of surgery in and around a penis or vagina will contain such things in the photograph. I believe that is is entirely appropriate to set the example that photographs of genitalia in medical and educational contexts are appropriate for all audiences. I believe that the precedent should be set that the penis and the vagina or more accurately in most cases the vulva should not be given special attention in medical contexts. To do so, gives the misimpression that there is something """"wrong"""" with human genitalia, which is a falsehood, and an antedeluvian cultural bias whose primitive nature should be abolished. In this century and millenium, is it time for such puritanical prudishness to end. One of the best ironies of discussions about such """"warnings"""" around medical photos is that they primarily serve to heighten the existence and nature of the photographs, and probably invite more study of them than might otherwise occur. In other words, they have the opposite of their intended purpose. The tend to draw more attention to such material, than might otherwise occur, while the tacit intention of people who want to put similarly silly warnings about such material is to """"hide"""" them and be bashful around them. It is high time that humans grow up and get over this silly aversions to the site of human genitalia. The wikipedia should be a place that sets an appropriate standard that medical information should be free from the psuedo censorship that such """"warnings"""" represent. On another note, on the basis of WP:V, a large portion of the wikipedia would be candidate for deletion. I believe such mention constitutes evidence that this article is being given unfair over-attention by a tacit faction whose true purpose is to censor subjects like the sort to which Toby Meltzer and its """"Good Article"""" subject matter relates.

Whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation.  In this case [organic remains] was added to explain the word 'they'.  While W&M; used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition, recently buried remains (such as what is """"now occurring"""") are not fossils.  From the """"Dictionary of Geologic Terms"""", 3rd edition, 1984, by Bates and Johnson:  FOSSIL:  Any remains, trace, or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth's crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time.  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.

W&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.

As much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.

NPOV
I have tagged this article as POV because it is filled with sentences like """"The Iranian Government security forces opened fire on protesters on the Shi'a holy day of Ashura, a day """"symbolically about justice"""" and during which any kind of violence is forbidden,"""" """"Irregularities during the 2009 Iranian presidential election caused resentment among many Iranians,"""" """"outspoken political dissenters were detained.[5][6] However, dissenters continued to speak out against the Government, leading to further protests in December 2009"""" and """"Security forces opened fire on the day of Ashura, the Shiite holy day """"symbolically about justice"""", a day which any kind of violence is forbidden,"""" which do not sound neutral or objective but like outright propaganda? 

Than in the protest section, rather than reporting the events objectively, quotes are used, not from people, but from pro-reformist articles, the result: """"Protesters in Tehran gathered  """"From Imam Hussain Square to Freedom Square"""", """"from east to west along Revolution Street"""", and it was on this day that """"the political and religious symbology of Iran's Islamic regime was turned on its head"""".[10] The protesters made another symbolic move- a """"symbolic journey from a square named after its most revered hero toward a monument dedicated to freedom, along a street called Revolution.""""[10]"""" is unbelievably POV, this should be immedietly changed to a proper written text which reports everything objectively. Meanwhile in the part about the demonstrations condemning the Ashura riots (which BTW, where much larger than the Ashura riots themselfes - a fact which was completely ignored by the writers of this wiki article), """"On December 30, counter-rallies staged and organized by the government at various cities, including Tehran, Qom, Arak, Shiraz and Isfahan called for the death of the protesters, with government workers receiving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations"""" the sentence """"with government workers recieving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations, was added in such POV manner and clearly to discredit those demonstrations.

Now although it is mentioned how rioters set fire cars, shops, banks and power stations (though other vandalism by the rioter isn't mentioned at all), this is such small part of the article. The violence by rioters (against people) is not mentioned at all, meanwhile there is a complete section devoted to alleged government violence against the protestors. The article is also clearly written with a goal of reporting only what is good for the green movement, this is illustrated not only by the POV quotes but by for isntance the way that whenever government claims are reported, they are immedietly rebuffed with other POV claims, leading me to believe they were only included to """"expose"""" the government as liars (which is POV). An example is """"Although official sources in Iran denied involvement of security forces in killing of protesters, at least one amateur video shows, the security truck which was deliberately running over the protesters.[16] Other evidence says that security forces were armed with guns and shot at protesters, including one amateur video showing a plainclothes security force directly shooting at protesters.[17],"""" with source 16 being non-existant and source 17 being a vehimently anti-Iranian blog showing a video of a gunman, of which there is no proof he is associated with the police of basij.

"Wade Park 

The whole point is that the park is much more than the museum (it's more than 10% of a square mile), so it's a significantly different entity from the museum itself.  Because there's no article on the HD, we shouldn't have its infobox anywhere at all.  Granted, we shouldn't have a stub for the sole purpose of filling a hole, but we also shouldn't pretend that another article fills that hole either.    

You are partially correct in your assertion made in the edit summary for the Wade Park article - the park isn't the entire district, but you are also partially incorrect. You're saying: The park itself is not the district, and the National Register database indicates that the park isn't even part of the district  where that I underlined is where you're erring.  The NRHP website lists this: Roughly bounded by E. 105 St., East Blvd., Chester and Euclid Aves. , Cleveland'' (650 acres, 7 buildings, 1 structure)'http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&recordid;=339http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/oh/Cuyahoga/districts.html Unless we are looking at different NRHP websites, and you haven't either spent time in Cleveland or ,at the very least, looked at trhe area in question on the map, then you're not taking into account two three things: 1) the 650 acres includes Wade Park (Google Map it). 2) The name Wade Park District explicitly (and even implicitly if you're familiar firsthand with the history of Cleveland). 3) (and this is related to my second point regarding a familiarity with the history of Cleveland) Jeptha Wade's property, which is where Wade Park is and the heart of the district in question, was the seed from where all the buildings in the district sprung from. The CMA, Botanical Gardens, Natural History Museum and Severance Hall, which all are part of the district, would not be there if Wade Park wasn't set aside to be the cultural epicenter that garnered it's NRHP entry.

Lastly, given that any one of the buildings listed on the registry are technically part of the WPHD, there would be no false information by including the NRHP infobox on any of those articles  which was my entire point of putting it on the CMA article in the first place. The infobox being clearly labelled as Wade Park District''' is not misleading by including it on a building that is part of the district. We could argue about this ad nauseam. But what's the point?

Of course I can make an entire article that covers the district specifically. But why just regurgitate the same stuff found in each individual Wikipedia article that exists for every building that is in the HD (including the Wade Park itself)? Bandwdith pollution notwithstanding, it is simply redundant. Or we could make it less redundant by simply putting the infobox in one of the articles already out there... and the Wade Park article being the namesake for the HD would make the most sense (the article is hardly complete, and could be expanded to include an entire section specifically about the HD and relationship bewteen the two)... and if not that article than the CMA which is the largest building in the HD, and the reason I put it there in the first. Either way, the underlying question in this argument that I have for you is this: how is it productive in our task as Wikipedians, and moreover as members of Ohio-specific Wikprojects, to keep adding and removing factual info from articles with direct relationships to the subject of our debate? Are we trying to make Wikpedia a more informative user-based encyclopedia, or are we nitpicking over how to make a piece of factual information, that is an important part of a large US City, available to those who are looking at Wikipedia for information?",0

It would be appropriate if you were to provide sources contradicting their occupation of such areas within those dates if the article is wrong.

The difference between Gas Piston and Direct Impingement technology for an AR-15

Posted by Stag Arms on Fri, Sep 06, 2013 

The AR-15 Rifle, while eminently customizable, carries with it a few conundrums. One is the choice of operating system; do you get a model which uses gas piston technology, or the more traditional direct impingement? 

Fans of the gas piston will state that impingement models are prone to jamming and often foul easily. Fans of the impingement model will call gas piston tech mechanically unsound. Who is correct, and what is the real difference between the model types here?

Basic AR Functionality – What makes an AR-15 an AR-15?

To qualify as an AR-15, a rifle must be self-loading, and be able to perform a specific set of basic functions mechanically, without user assistance. To be more specific when depressing the trigger, the rifle needs to fire a single cartridge, and then extract that spent case from the chamber and eject it in some manner. Next, it must then load an unspent cartridge into the chamber. The round is plucked from the magazine, the breech is then locked, and the hammer cocked. The rifle will then have a fresh round loaded, and again be ready to fire.
 
Direct Impingement – How do the original AR-15 models work?

Direct Impingement is the original technology, devised by Eugene Stoner. Propellant gas is bled through a small hole located in the barrel, which is then channeled through a very small tube where it can proceed to directly contact (or impinge) the bolt carrier mechanism. At this point the gas is pushed to the rear of the rifle, and the spent case is extracted and ejected. It is then pushed forward by spring-loaded action, and strips an unspent round from the cartridge, loading it directly into the chamber of the barrel. Contrary to the statements of Gas Piston proponents we have put over 2000 rounds through rifles without cleaning and without malfunction.

 

Gas Piston Technology – How do the new piston technologies work?

Gas piston technology was first used in modern firearms by Mikhail Kalashnikov on the AK-47. While similar at first blush to direct impingement systems, there are a few key differences in operation. The firing process again begins with propellant gases being bled into the barrel. However, instead of being forced into a tube as it is in a direct impingement system, it is contained in a separate cylinder. 

This cylinder contains a piston(similar in operation to what you may find in an AK-47). The gas moves the piston, is in turn pushes the bolt carrier rearward to handle the extraction and ejection process, and then is moved pushed forward to the closed position by a spring just as with direct impingement.

 

ar-15

 

Which system is better?

The direct impingement has proven itself through the years on the AR-15 platform and replacement parts are inexpensive, easy to obtain, and generally made to a set “mil-spec” standard.  Due to the hot gas from the fired cartridge being redirected into the action it will quickly heat up and become dirty requiring a cool down period before the bolt carrier can be removed from the rifle.

The action of a piston rifle remains cool and clean, even after shooting 100 rounds in rapid succession. The bolt carrier can be removed immediately and held in your hand without burning yourself. The trade off for the action staying cool and clean is that you will experience snappier recoil when shooting which makes the piston rifle a little less accurate, especially for follow up shots. Finally, piston system parts are not interchangeable between manufacturers due to there being no set standard and the use of proprietary pistons and bolt carriers

The Jazz Bird: Fact vs. fiction 
________________________________________

        Craig Holden's novel The Jazz Bird, is based on the 1927 murder trial of Cincinnati bootlegger George Remus. Here's a quick look at where fact and fiction converge and diverge: 
        George Remus, the killer 
        Fiction: A lawyer and pharmacist who comes to Cincinnati from Chicago in the 1920s with a scheme that makes him at least $20 million. He buys distilleries licensed to sell “medicinal” whiskey to drug companies and then sells the booze to dummy drug companies while shipping it to illegal customers. 
        Truth: A lawyer and pharmacist, he was a friend and co-counsel of famed defense lawyer Clarence Darrow. Mr. Darrow testified as a character witness for him at his trial. He came to Cincinnati from Chicago and turned a $10,000 investment into an estimated $80 million fortune in less than three years. He sold “medicinal” whiskey to legitimate drug companies he set up, then stole the whiskey from the drug companies. 
        Charlie P. Taft, the prosecutor 
        Fiction: He is the son of former United States President William Howard Taft and plans a career in politics. He fades away after losing the case. 
        Truth: He was the youngest son of the former president. He became Hamilton County prosecutor just a few months before the trial. His political career suffered a setback after the trial — he wasn't nominated for a second term as prosecutor. He did stay in politics, helping found the Cincinnati Charter Committee and serving as a councilman and mayor until his retirement almost 50 years later. He ran an unsuccessful race as a Republican for Ohio governor in 1952, the year George Remus died. 
        Imogene Remus, the victim 
        Fiction: She is the wealthy 25-year-old daughter of a high society family in Cincinnati. She is the wife of a World War I veteran left in a coma by a shell fragment when she meets George Remus. She tries, unsuccessfully to get Remus accepted by Cincinnati society. 
        Truth: She was a 35-year-old secretary in Chicago when she divorced her first husband to marry George Remus, who divorced his first wife to marry her. She entertained lavishly in Cincinnati in hopes of being accepted into Cincinnati society. The Cincinnati upper crust was willing to buy Mr. Remus' whiskey, but never accepted him, or his wife, as social equals. She was 39 when she was killed. 
        The trial 
        Fiction: George Remus defends himself, pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. He plays to the press and frequently disrupts the proceedings, which are likened to a Vaudeville show by the Enquirer. The jury acquits him in 20 minutes, recommends his release from the hospital in time for Christmas and drinks up at a party he throws for them. 
        Truth: That's all true.

Logan duked out for AP honor 
________________________________________

The Associated Press 
        ATLANTA — UC's Steve Logan was third behind Duke's Jason Williams and Kansas' Drew Gooden in voting for The Associated Press college basketball player of the year. 
        UC's Bob Huggins was fifth in voting for coach of the year. 
        Logan received eight votes, Williams 38 and Gooden 18 from the 72-member national panel that selects the weekly AP Top 25. 
        Huggins got 7 votes behind Pittsburgh's Ben Howland (16), Bob Knight of Texas Tech (11), Ernie Kent of Oregon (10) and Roy Williams of Kansas (9). 
        Williams, the only unanimous All-America selection this season, is the second straight Duke player to be selected national player of year and the fifth Blue Devil to win the Adolph Rupp Award. 
        Shane Battier won last season. The other Duke players to be honored were Elton Brand in 1999, Christian Laettner in 1992 and Art Heyman in 1963. 
        Williams thanked his coach, Mike Krzyzewski, who missed the ceremony after undergoing hip replacement surgery on Wednesday. 
        “Being with Coach K the past three years is the best thing I could have ever asked for,” Williams said. “I owe him everything.” 
        Williams, a junior also voted to the All-America team as a sophomore, averaged 21.3 points, 3.5 rebounds and 5.3 assists for the defending champion Blue Devils (31-4), ranked No. 1 for all but four weeks this season. He shot 45.7 percent from the field, including 38.3 percent from 3-point range. 
        Howland led the Panthers (29-6) to the most victories in school history, their first appearance",0

The other IP user had replaced somebody else's comment with his own, and, when I attempted to take care of it, somebody had already reverted the edit, resulting in the old comment being restored and the new comment, which the IP editor posted (and removed the other comment in the process) being removed. Please browse the diffs starting from here. In my opinion, the edit was made in good faith. I restored the comment. The editor appeared to be legitimately inquiring about a deletion or revert. I reposted and signed it. I had noticed that you have reverted my edit. Please note that I have not at all made my edit in bad faith, and that I have never made bad faith edits to Wikipedia.

 Wikilings exposed at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html  

I had an email exchange with Matt Crypto (the, er, self-proclaimed """"Nobody"""" who admits he knows nothing about the topic being discussed -though he improperly deletes it http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html ), asking him to stop spamming his childish comments and spamming his deletions of my Wikipedia posts and to stop emailing me. (He seems to think that Wikipedia is his whole world and is the entire internet, and it is not. Nice. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html ) Anyway, Matt's only response was to make off-topic childish remarks and  here's the genius part  when Matt's own childish remarks (similar to Matt's reply above) are repeated back to Matt in an effort to show Matt his childishness (and to mock Matt) Matt becomes mad and remains clueless.  I suppose Matt thinks that when he does this, he's done something very clever. Sadly, Matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his """"nah-nee-nah"""" voice. It is amusing, though, to see Matt (a grown-up?) do it.  Here are the points that Matt never addresses, does not dispute, but always tries to delete so that other wikipedians will not know:

Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute.  """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""   Professor Curry showed that many modern myths rely on a false belief that Nazis called themselves """"Nazis"""" (Party members referred to themselves as """"National Socialists"""" and did not use the term """"Nazis"""").""",0

 Original Research/Other 

The article mentions some details about the combos, as well as character storylines.  Although these things do seem accurate, a lot of material seems to have been written by someone familiar with the game and doesn't cite the source.  Perhaps a simple sentence, like """"The arcade included the following descriptions"""" would be more precise.  Meltdown's name is probably able to be cited from a Nintendo Power.

Winning the game with Eyedol does have an ending storyline that clearly parodies Blanka from Street Fighter II.  Another note is that the SNES version had a different ending (saying something about Eyedol's bracelet) whereas the arcade version mentioned the club.

Some notable game play features: I think the sky stage is perhaps noteworthy, as it could lead to some very short games on the arcade (although the Tekken series was known to have even faster fights).  Also, in the arcade Eyedol had a notably easy infinite combo (when the opponent was at the edge of a stage), plus a much more difficult infinite combo (running back and forth), and the SNES version didn't have these things.

The comment above about tapping a low button might be referring to the easy repeatable combos in KI2, which would be another game.

KI1 and KI2 used the exact same motherboard (the model # / name / whatever was identical on both motherboards), and the software was different only by the chips installed in the motherboard and the hard drive.  (Surprising, perhaps, considering how different the games graphical feels look from each other.)  These games used the Ultra 64 hardware, which was the correct name for the hardware at the time of KI1's release.  Rare had said (in some unofficial strategy guide) that they had no concerns/reason-to-worry about KI Gold matching the performance of KI2, making some smart remark about those concerns only being needed when moving to a less powerful machine.  (KI Gold was initially also going to have more characters, but the memory limitations of the cartridge later proved to prevent this.)  Therefore, it's not out of line to think that the N64 is really significantly different than the Ultra 64, other than the lack of the hard drive.  Cruisin' USA is known to use some other motherboard, and reference the Ultra 64 just as an unrelated advertisement.

Bugs in the game could probably get their own section, including Orchid's attacking after turning into a frog, opponents shrinking with Thunder's combo, Riptor being unable to get a high hitting combo when the Ultra misses, and the fight being able to continue on after Orchid initiates her Ultra (if initiated after hitting the opponent into the air and then backflipping, and having the opponent hit her out of the Ultra).""",0

""""BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) — Moammar Gadhafi loyalists seized control of a Libyan city and raised the ousted regime's green flag, an official and military commanders said Tuesday, in the most serious revolt yet against the country's government.

The retaking of Bani Walid highlights the vulnerability of Libya's new leaders, who have faced mounting criticism as they struggle to unify the oil-rich North African nations and build state institutions from scratch three months after Gadhafi was captured and killed.

The seizure also appeared to be the first major, organized operation by armed remnants of Gadhafi's regime, adding to the security woes of the ruling National Transitional Council. The council has so far made little progress in unifying armed forces. Instead it is left reliant on multiple """"revolutionary brigades,"""" militias made up of citizens-turned-fighters, usually all from a specific city or even neighborhood.

The militias were created during the months of civil war against Gadhafi's forces last year and when the war ended in October, the various brigades remain in control of security affairs of each city they liberated. Though loyal to the NTC, they have also feuded among themselves and acted on their own initiative, and the council has been unable to control them.

Hundreds of well-equipped and highly trained remnants of Gadhafi's forces battled for eight hours in Bani Walid with the local revolutionary brigade, known as the May 28 Brigade, which was eventually driven out, said Mubarak al-Fatmani, the head of Bani Walid local council. The Gadhafi loyalists then raised the green flag over buildings in the western city.

On Monday's attack, he said four revolutionary fighters were killed and 25 others were wounded.

The revolutionary brigade had kept only a superficial control over the mountain city, a longtime Gadhafi stronghold which was one of the last to fall to NTC rule late last year.""""The only link between Bani Walid and the revolution was May 28, now it is gone and 99 percent of Bani Walid people are Gadhafi loyalists,"""" said the head of Bani Walid's military council, Abdullah al-Khazmi, confirming the fall of the city. He spoke to The Associated Press at a position on the eastern outskirts of Bani Walid, where hundreds of pro-NTC reinforcements from Benghazi were deployed, with convoys of cars mounted with machine guns.

A top commander of a revolutionary brigade in Bani Walid, Ali al-Fatmani, who was present in Benghazi during the attack, says he has lost contact with other fighters in the town.The three officials said the attackers belong to Brigade 93, a militia newly created by Gadhafi loyalists who reassembled after the fall of the regime. The fighters, flush with cash and heavy weaponry including incendiary bombs, have been increasing in power in the city, they said.

'''A month ago, Gadhafi loyalists attacked another revolutionary brigade from Tripoli that entered Bani Walid, killing 13, said al-Fatmani.""""

You realize, No September, that you're essentially giving in to trollery here?  John Kerry and George W Bush attract trolls, predictably.

Why was so much more censoring action done here, while allowing MONGO to edit without accountability and locking up the talk page and refusing to hear of the matter on his talk page, effectively giving him total control of the article?

Do not edit or revert a temporarily protected page, except to add a protected page notice, a link to Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute or Wikipedia:NPOV dispute, or a similar disclaimer about the current state of an article, unless there is widespread agreement that the page was protected in violation of these policies.
Do not protect a page you are involved in an edit dispute over.
Admins should not protect pages in which they are involved. Involvement includes making substantive edits to the page (fixing vandalism does not count), or expressing opinions about the article on the talk page before the protection. Admin powers are not editor privileges — admins should only act as servants to the user community at large. If you are an admin and you want a page in an edit war in which you are somehow involved to be protected, you should contact another admin and ask them to protect the page for you. Not only is this the preferable method, it is also considered more ethical to do so as it helps reduce any perceived conflict of interest.
 Important Note: When a page is particularly high profile, either because it is linked off the main page, or because it has recently received a prominent link from offsite, it will often become a target for vandalism. It is not appropriate to protect pages in this case. Instead, consider adding them to your watchlist, and reverting vandalism yourself.
Why weren't these policies complied with?  This is not a special case; the policy provides for cases just like this.

 Joseph McCabe criticisms - lack of NPOV 

I previously added criticism to this section from Joseph McCabe, drawing from his writings in """"History's Greatest Liars"""". This was dismissed as being a fringe viewpoint. This I disagree with. I'd first note the lack of criticism of St. Francis and Franciscans, demonstrating a lack of NPOV (something commented on by others), and also a conflict of interest in Marauder40 deleting these comments, where he seems to act with a conflict of interest, being a devoted Catholic and member of a Secular Franciscan order, as noted in his bio. I do not see him as someone to act with impartiality in considering criticisms of Franciscans.

I now look at whether Joseph McCabe's views can be considered as """"Fringe"""" Joseph McCabe has an entry in Wikipedia, n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_mccabe , and was himself a Franciscan Monk till the age of 19. He therefore draws on his own background in critiquing the Franciscans, and is a recognised scholar.

Of this particular comment, the origin is not Joseph McCabe alone, he draws from """"The Middle Ages"""" by Professor James Westfall Thompson, where on page 674 he says """"With wealth the old familiar evils that had corrupted the older orders corrupted the Franciscans and Dominicans too"""". He also draws upon the writings of Father Hoetzappel, a historian of the Franciscan order, not to mention his own pertinent background and experiences.

In this light, I consider the comment I introduced earlier as appropriate to Wikipedia, providing a range of views and importantly, criticism from a recognised scholar.

And also, he always undo my edits when i put my claim, even i had a discussion with him but he seems to me like an arrogant and thinks that he's self sophisticated and self centred and like just he own these pages and only he could make edits and only his sources are reliable. Currently he's got that page blocked from editing with the help of some other users. So please you can do something about that? And also it feels to me and other peoples like denying our right to edit on wikipedia even when we've reliable source of information as to put as reference. And moreover that user looks to me an east freak, everywhere just putting east and east and east.",0

Impacts the 2010 Midterm Congressional Elections has on the 
Presidential Election in 2012
TABIn the 2010 midterm congressional elections, the Republican party took control of the House while the Senate remains a Democrat majority. With the House being in control by the the Republicans, it is going to be difficult, if not impossible to pass legislation without some sort of compromise. With the economy at a low and the unemployment rate still high, the people of The United States are looking for government help to strengthen the economy. President Obama has tried to strengthen the economy with the $800 million dollar stimulus bill. Matt Bai, a New York Times reporter, states in his article about the President, Debt-Busting Issue May Force Obama Off Fence, “And in virtually every case, he has satisfied pretty much no one.” With the 2012 presidential election in two years, both parties will need to gain the approval of the American people to succeed in the election.
TABThe outcome of the 2010 midterm congressional election shows that the 2012 presidential election will be based upon which party can demonstrate that they are going to help the economy grow and act upon the self-interests of the people.
TABMany are attempting to draw upon historical context to predict the outcome of the next presidential election. Some people believe that Obama will be a one term President. Marc Pascal, a writer for The Moderate Voice in: economy, law, politics, and society, states in his opinion piece, Obama will be a one-term President, “2010 is not a parallel to 1994, 1894, or to any other noteworthy year identified by various pundits across the political spectrum. What worked sufficiently well in the 1980’s and the 1990’s for Presidents Reagan and Clinton will not be appropriate for the myriad of challenges facing our nation in 2010 and beyond.” Pascal relates Obama to be more like Presidents Hoover and Carter who were “one-term” Presidents. Pascal compares President Obama with Hoover by stating, “The start of the Great Recession began before the presidential elections.” Pascal looks back with President Hoover and relates his presidency with Obama's, “Contrarily President Hoover was elected before the 1929 collapse and his efforts, over the next 3 years were wholly unsuccessful in extricating the U.S. from a deep and structural Depression. This huge failure naturally resulted in the 1932 election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Democrats running things for the next 16 years.”  
TABIn Pascal's analysis, he concluded that looking back to President Hoover's presidency as well with President Carter's presidency, Obama would suffer the same fate as they did by only serving one term as president. However, not everyone agrees with Pascal's conclusion. Historical analysis shows that this can swing in Obama's favor.
TABUsing the opposite argument, you could say that President Clinton took a huge blow in the 1994 midterm elections of his presidency with a loss of 52 House seats along with eight Senate seats, thus putting Clinton's Presidential agenda in jeopardy. With President Clinton's popularity down in the 1994 midterm elections, President Clinton was able to meet halfway with the Republican legislature allowing him to win the 1996 presidential election. Also in 1938, the biggest loss in midterm election history, President Franklin D. Roosevelt lost 71 House seats and six Senate seats. With Roosevelt suffering tremendous losses in his 1938 midterm election, he was still able to run and continue in office for his third and fourth terms. Another President  who won re-election after a huge blow in the midterm election is Harry Truman. President Truman lost 45 House seats and 12 Senate seats during the 1946 midterm election but still won re-election in 1948. With President Obama loosing a historical 63 House seats and six Senate seats in the 2010 midterm elections, history shows it does not mean President Obama will loose re-election in 2012 due to losses in the last midterms.
TABThe economy in the United States is currently at a standstill. With President Obama signing the stimulus bill, the free-falling economy was saved from further peril. People in The United States are not satisfied with the way that Obama is handling the economy. Updated on December 1, 2010 Obama has approval ratings of 25 percent strong support, but he still faces a high 42 percent disapproval (Rasmussum Reports). With Obama having such a high percentage of those against his policies, he will need to attempt to meet with the Republicans halfway on upcoming legislation. At this moment in time Obama is having little luck compromising with the Republicans. Tamara Lytle quotes President Obama in an AARP bulletin, “We're going to need to work together — Democrats and Republicans and independents — to get it all done. But, you know what,",0

Regarding the google rankings, I don't see how you can divorce the """"Cork City"""" hits from the """"Cork County"""" hits.  Which is a very relevant distinction.  On whatlinkshere, there are 1100 inlinks to city and 800 to county; pretty close.  If there were no other convention, then Cork would already be a disambiguation page even without cork (material) to contend with.  However, the overriding convention appears to be (Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (Ireland-related articles)#Disambiguation of locations in Ireland):
Where a town and county have the same name, the county article should be named as County Countyname, and the town should be located at County/townname (if no further disambiguation is needed). For example, Sligo and County Sligo.
It's only a talk-page suggestion, but absent anything stronger it's unexceptionable.  However, throw cork (material) back into the mix and it's clear that it's not a contest between material and city; it's a contest between material, city and county.

"""== Spyros Sofos ==

I'm not sure if you are Spyros Sofos or just a fan of his but Wikipedia is not a blog to promote the personal political views of Mr. Sofos and/or his associates.  I say this because your posting history here seems to reflect a cheerleading mentality towards Mr. Sofos rather than accepting that everyone can also be criticized for their views.

A couple of myths you believe that I'd like to clear up.

a. Spyros Sofos makes it clear that he does not see himself related to ancient Greeks in his works. Despite confusion over using similar nomenclature this effectively means his use of the word """"Greek"""" is of non-ethnic Greek context. Mr. Sofos see's national/ethnic identities as """"imagined communities"""".  (and not only Greeks  he deconstructs Turkish identity as well). While he is allowed to have a philosophical point of view, he can't have his proverbial cake and eat it too. He's a Greek citizen but not an ethnic Greek.

b. Spyros Sofos is certainly criticized by the far right in Greece but this point obfuscates its not just the far right that criticizes him. For instance, Mr. Sofos uses the word """"Macedonia"""" to describe the former Yugoslav republic is criticized by Greeks of all political persuasions (including both moderate left and right parties). His  narration of history is also criticized by Greeks of all political affiliations for casually dismissing Greek themes present since antiquity.

 Perpetual Virginity 

The article currently states: """"After giving birth to Christ, Mary did have sexual relations,"""" and """"In the little time that Joseph was still around after the birth of and they had several more children.""""  Certainly some people believe these assertions, but they don't belong in an article that presents the Roman Catholic Church's Marian dogmas.

The article also says that: """"Mary did break her vow by the grace of God.""""  The writer seems to mean that God gave Mary a free pass to have sex but remain a virgin.  That really needs a citation, because I've never heard anything like it.  The RC Church teaches that Mary was really and truly a virgin her whole life, and other people believe she had sex and bore children, but as far as I know, no one teaches that she had sex, but God was okay with it, so we call her a virgin anyway.  Without a citation, this statement should go.

 OK, I'll grant to both of you that, in a perfect world, the interest factor is as important as everything else I've outlined ... but we are so far from a perfect world at DYK and there is so much that needs attention !  DYK has the opportunity to train editors early on and get articles off on the right foot ... instead, procedures and practices (there and at WIKICUP) encourage the churning out of deficient articles to gain perceived prizes.  And what happens to the """"interest factor"""" is the same as what happens to prose and sourcing ... editors learn, indeed are encouraged by reviewers, to pad up their articles so that expansion/length is met, and there is often no regard for whether that padding is a) based on reliable sources, b) relevant to the article, or c) well written.  A similar thing happens when we demand interesting hooks ... that quickly becomes scandalously ridiculous tabloid style hooks, often with BLP issues or MEDRS issues of plain faulty hooks because non-reliable sources are used.  We have admins whose own DYK hooks are inaccurate, and are passed, based on blog sources. Recently. SO ... yes, interesting hooks might be one part of training new and experienced editors and encouraging responsible and policy-compliant editing, but there's a huge iceberg under that tip at DYK that is not being addressed because the few qualified reviewers who are active there cannot keep up with the volume, and we have several entrenched DYK regulars who either don't care about copyvio and reliable sources or simply and still after many years of editing do not even understand core policies.  There is a need to address the whole picture not just """"lame hooks"""" and the whole picture cannot be corrected unless you work with the few clueful regulars there to deal with the several who lack clue, impose their will, and routinely place deficient articles on the mainpage.   DYK will never be eliminated (it probably should be because it is responsible for so much truly bad content that will never be cleaned up), so can we at least work to improve reviewing there ?  A slowdown in volume would help, along with an elimination of QPQ so that knowledgeable reviewers can assure our mainpage is being used responsibly.

OK, here goes at another attempted explanation.  Ignore the IP currently using 221/6. His intentions appear to be good, but I don't think he is helping.
 Stop taking this personally. No-one actually knows you, all we have to go on are a set of edits. We are largely strangers to each other - strong statements like """"betrayal"""" and """"slander"""" suggest motives that imply the other editor has taken against you personally.
 You are treating people's comments in a strangely literal way. If you don't understand what someone says - just ask them to explain a different way. Do not assume that everything is an attack.
 Copyright - yes you may absolutely tag and report something that appears to have been copied and pasted from another source.  What you need to watch for is that the other site didn't get its material from Wikipedia to start with.  They don't always credit Wikipedia as the source. However, it is better to tag it than not - the project cannot afford the risk.
 Notability - rather than tag an article for deletion, start a discussion. With the soap opera characters, starting a general discussion about notability at the WikiProject is a good idea.  If the talkpage is active, start a discussion there. Always try to notify the article creator.
 Read WP:BEFORE.  Non-notable articles rarely damage the project unless they are also inaccurate or completely foolish (an article about my cat for example would be completely foolish, as the cat is known to no-one outside my family and our neighbours, and is just an ordinary cat), so there's often no urgent rush to delete things that are non-notable.  Someone spent time and effort working on it.  What other steps might be taken - can the information be merged into another article and a WP:REDIRECT used, for example.
 If you eventually decide that nominating for a deletion discussion is the only option, use a neutral rationale. Do not attack the article creator because they have disagreed with you. Remember it is a discussion. Do not attribute any motive to those who disagree other than the differing viewpoint of a stranger.
 Images - if you find someone has pirated an image from a newspaper website, and uploaded it as their own work, yes you absolutely must tag it as a copyvio for speedy deletion.  In other instances, it is better to identify the least drastic option to deal with the damage.  Can I fix it myself? Can I alert the uploader - maybe they just made a mistake? If in doubt, always tag for WP:PUF which results in a discussion, not for deletion.
 Talk - explain why you thought what you did. Don't post reams of justifications and question the motives of others. You may be right, but you'll lose if you can't discuss things with people.
 Read the guidelines and policies and understand what the project is about.  You haven't got it yet.   """,0

I have considered each source used in the article. Some were affiliate, some non-authoritative, and some did not comply with the WP: GNG rule """"Significant coverage"""". I am not in any kind of relations with other participants of the discussion, this may be easily checked. Do hope for your comments and help. May be it is worth to put an article for deletion again, using my arguments and taking in account other people's opinion? Because the conclusion """"no consensus"""" is not quite right: its absence or presence were not demonstrated. Arguments were simply ignored. Can you give any comments about my arguments?   """,0

Sometimes we agree.  Sometimes we don't, but it's all good as far as I am concerned.  I was not referring to you in any of my comments about shenanigans at NARM.

Compatibility
Paul Thurott has written an article about compatibility issues with the Beta, which makes me doubt the final release's compatibility.  

Removed Features
 
 
 _/|\_I don't know why the Removed Features section claims that the classic start menu and taskbar will be
 removed. Nor do I know why the Inkball game is supposedly removed. This section cites no references and these
 claims are the most questionable.  

I'm not sure as the the reasons as to why they we're removed but I can tell you that Ink Ball is not found anywhere in the beta release, I'm not sure about the classic start menu and taskbar, i don't see an option for them but I didn't look all that hard   

 Inkball only appears in Tablet Edition windows products.  Is there a tablet addition of the Windows 7 beta?   
 Hmm... I may be wrong there.  The article mentions that it also appeared in Vista Home Edition.  Still, Can't imagine it's very fun with a mouse.   
It does indeed come with Vista Home Premium, not sure about other editions.   
It also comes with Ultimate. But anyway, mentioning it has been removed if the only evidence we have is it's not included in the current beta is an incredibly bad idea. We need a reliable source saying Microsoft has decided to remove it. There could be plenty of reasons why it's not in beta, only one of them is Microsoft has decided to remove it completely

You quickly forget that I am objecting to the MISINTERPRETATION of a 'rule', and the MISAPPLICATION of a 'rule'.   (or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!
 Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, """"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this."""" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)
In response, I would have immediately said, """"Good question!""""  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   
But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, """"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit..."""").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.

 """"Delhi tops the list in crimes among all states of India, followed by Maharashtra""""
 You haven't read the article you linked to. Quote from the article: """"UP accounted for the highest 33.9% of the total crime reported in India last year followed by Andhra Pradesh (13.9%) and TN (11.4%).""""
 It does say that as a city, Delhi, followed by Mumbai, tops the crime list among the """"mega cities"""". Like I said - such a statistic is meaningless unless you consider per capita. Please read my comment again.
 You cannot say that """"Tamil Nadu is more crime-oriented than Goa because TN is #3 on the list, far ahead of Goa."""" If the population of Goa is 10 times less than that of TN, it won't be surprising if 1000 cases were reported in TN as opposed to only 100 in Goa. Delhi and Mumbai are the most populous cities in India, so it's not surprising that the highest number of crimes are repored in these cities.
 Another example: India's GDP is higher than that of Australia, Canada, Singapore and several other countries  that doesn't mean that India is the among the richest countries in the world. The per capita figures are the true indicator.

 """"If so then even London is capital of UK does it mean crimes in London could be ignored?""""
 That's a straw man argument. Who said anything about crimes being ignored?  The demographics section of the article on Delhi already mentions that """"Delhi accounted for the highest percentage (16.2%) of the crimes reported in 35 Indian cities with populations of one million or more"""" and """"Delhi accounts for 15.4% of crime against women in Indian cities."""" We are talking about inclusion of POV statements like """"rape and crime capital"""" in the intro of the article. If you want to add a section to the article, go ahead. See New York City#Crime for an example.

 """"Livemint is also not a valid news paper or recognized source like TOI or The Hindu""""
 Mint is published by HT Media (of Hindustan Times fame), in collaboration with the The Wall Street Journal. Anyway, that's not what we are discussing here.

""""TOI has given latest stats (2012). Hence your info is out dated compared to mine.""""
 Nope. Like I said, you haven't read the article you are referring to. It's dated 2011. And I've already discussed the article contents above.

 """"new comers should be made aware of these to protect their lives by taking caution or avoiding the city""""

LittleOldMe, I agree with you on this issue. It is not POV to say Chavez is a Mexican-American. It also doesn't single him out. The primary argument against the edit seems to be that his mexican heritage somehow detracts from him. This does not seem to be a viable argument. First, you assume there is a negative connotation to being from a mexican heritage. To assume some people might view this in a negative light ignores the reality that any statement on a page can be looked at in a negative light by a person. The fact you list Chavez as an American will cause some people to look at him in a negative light. The same issue occurs with him being a union leader (people are against the union). Second, you ignore the fact far more reliable sources, dealing with far greater issues of a need for nuetrality have """"labeled"""" him as a Mexican American. If the library of Congress can refer to him as a mexican american, why not wikipedia? The library of Congress is a reliable source, and not POV. It seems to me that the exclusion seems to be POV, in that it is pushing an unkown agenda. I don't know what the agenda is.

Given that by definition """"to steal and pass off the ideas or words of another as one’s own"""" and using a """"created production without crediting the source"""" is plagiarism or literary theft, when use is made of the word Ebonics (an original idea and word coined by Dr. Robert Williams as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, this deceptive pattern of practice is ‘plagiaristic’ dishonesty or ‘literary theft’ that violates national and international laws protecting ‘intellectual property’ rights. This kind of plagiarism or stealth of ‘intellectual property’ via literary theft and the intentional perversion of the truth should not be tolerated and the authors of articles and books as well as publishers of dictionaries including Wikipedia, progating counterfeit and plagiaristic definitions of the word Ebonics must be held accountable.

As such, I like to enjoy this as a privilege rather than a burden, and I am sure going for adminship would require adding some responsibility which I can't commit to at the moment.

An earlier version of this article - The Network of Buddhist Organisations UK - did quote its aims and it is true that these do appear on the NBO website.

In order to avoid having to argue with brainless machines (and absent editors), I rewrote the article without quoting the aims but got the same notice, this time without any justification.

@ you will do just fine; and Shabaz was """"made"""" to retire as far as my personal opinion is concerned(his is by far the dirtiest dysysop I have witnessed ever). However Dougweller is quite an expert so his input will be valuable. Now to matter at hand. The current version of the article has three basic problems which I will list below. We can discuss them together or separately as you wish. (Code 16 apparently agrees with my other edits, even though he does not wish to state it, I would also like to state that  is quite right, I misunderstood prophetic as being concerned with prophecy at first but I am certain now that it means pertaining to the prophet)
 It has been proven here that Israr Khan is just a non notable run of the mill professor at some Malaysian university who writes self published books. Consensus has already been reached between me and Code16 that he is an unreliable source for content, as is clear from the discussion I linked. So I would like to contest his views being added here, or anywhere else for that matter. 
 Hallaq has been given a new section all by himself without any rationale. He is a western scholar so he should be included with other western scholars and given due weight. To be frank his weight should be LESS than other western scholars, as he is not a scholar of hadith per se. He is a scholar of law/jurisprudence, and as law is based on hadith he is also knowledgeable in hadith. But he cannot compare with other scholars whose main interest was hadith.  
 I would like to contest the creation of """"authenticity"""" subsection. My  argument is that this section is highly misleading. It leads one to assume that other scholars are against hadith for other reason, whereas in reality almost all scholars(both western and eastern) criticize hadith because they consider it as """"inauthentic"""". So this section should not be created at all. Regards   """,0

Well, mister, please don't quit botany. I hope you will write about it. I don't need to have any user account to write here. There is much work to do and it takes time. I can tell you that I use several books as """"ANIMALI Come sono. Done vivono. Come vivono"""" from an italian Edizioni Labor-Milano by a group with G. Scortecci, director del instituto de la Universidad de Génova (Chenoa) translated in 1960 to spanish by """"Vergara Editorial"""". So, I translated from spanish to english a text of italian origen. I prefer mostly fishes anphibians and lizards, in this order. But as you know  I used to write too, about plants that are totally unknown for me. I hope in future to visit the Mamut caves in Kentucky and see the blind fishes. We use to create new pages with an account because it is requested by Wikipedia.

 You know, I'd be in favour of a reduced Studio Alliances section (""""Studio Support""""), given this isn't a comparison article and as written the whole thing is utterly unreadable. Something along the lines of a bulleted list of studios supporting HD DVD (with an appropriate asterisk and comment next to WB), and a short paragraph reporting that many studios have decided to actively not support HD DVD, preferring Blu-ray, and reporting the major ones. The way I see it, it would work something along the lines of:

Studio Support

To date, approximately 30% of recently released movies are available in HD DVD format. The following studios and publishers offer HD DVD content:

Universal Studios (including subsidiaries Focus Features and Rogue Pictures)
Paramount Pictures
Nickelodeon Movies
MTV Films
DreamWorks Pictures and DreamWorks Animation
The Weinstein Company (including Dimension Films).
The BBC
First Look Studios
Image Entertainment (including the Discovery Channel)
Magnolia Pictures
Brentwood Home Video
Ryko
Koch/Goldhil Entertainment
Medusa Home Entertainment
Studio Canal
Universum Films
Kinowelt Home Entertainment
DVD International
Opus Arte
MK2
Momentum Pictures
Twister Home Video

Additionally Warner Brothers currently releases its content on HD DVD, though has announced it will cease supporting HD DVD in June 2008.

Many major studios have chosen not to support HD DVD, having decided to exclusively back the rival Blu-ray format. These studios include Fox, Disney, and many others.
This is a much simpler and easier to read than the current """"ACME studios announced it plans to support HD DVD for three weeks in March, but pr0n Studios Inc has released 72% of its content in the Chinese EVD format but plans to switch to HD DVD in 2009"""" format that the section is in currently. And it does do away with the need to have a graph in that section as it's no longer a richard-waving area.

"""

Now that I'm unblocked, I can post my reply to you.

You are again using the same tactics you used a few weeks ago, in an apparent effort to censor me, and to prevent me from trying to improve this page by adding more credible information.

Immediately after challenging me this last time, you had me blocked so that I could not respond.  One wonders what you are afraid of. You appear to fit the profile of those who use sneaky maneuvers to block people or to otherwise prevent edits containing information you disagree with, from ever seeing the light of day on Wikipedia. As reported on CNN and ABC last month, these tactics are why Wikipedia has been attacked so much lately, and why it's being taken less and less seriously as time goes on.  Such behavior is slowly turning Wikipeidia into a bit of a joke, and has helped diminish it's once significant potential for good.

Your attempts at censorship reminds one of the scene in a movie years ago where a person who was about to be exposed on the front pages of their local newspaper, got up early the morning it was to be delivered, and ran through their neighborhood picking up all their neighbors' papers, in the misplaced belief that their neighbors would never learn the truth that was on the front page of that morning's paper.

Interestingly, rather than trying to support your allegations of danger and harmfulness with solid facts and evidence, you and others who share a common point of view that poppers are bad, continue to attack those who actually possess a high level of knowledge about these compounds. If you don't like what people with whom you do not agree try to post, rather than debating from a position of solid facts and underlying supporting documentation, you try to 'shoot the  messenger'.

For example, in addition to your maneuvers to block me and prevent me from replying to your attacks or to post edits with accurate and clarifying information on nitrites/poppers, you attack me by implying that my screen name, 'Allabout' means I sell poppers.

You are wrong.

You also imply that I  am """"associated with http://www.allaboutpoppers.com/"""".

Again, you are wrong. 

However, I happen to agree with those who say that the 'All About Poppers' site contains a great deal of credible information, supported with solid evidence. I've spent a great deal of time reading the site, and digging into the information presented there. I know of other similarly credible popper sites, as well.  Would you say I am """"associated"""" with them, too?

As the record clearly shows, over the past few weeks, you and others (Some of whom may be one in the same, perhaps using proxy servers to mask true identities to try to avoid being charged with sock puppetry),  have engaged in an ongoing effort to prevent myself and others, with whom you do no agree on the subject of nitrites and poppers, from contributing to this page with some of our knowledge.  That is wrong, and you know it. (I note that, today, you have somehow successfully removed/erased the history that was showing up on the site's 'history' page. This history showed the """"summary"""" comments for various edits.  It now appears you've allowed it back  in.)

You say, """"just tell me: If this is all wrong and misleading......."""".

I have not said """"this is all wrong and misleading"""". There is information on this page which is accurate, and there's information on this page which is not accurate.  But, when someone who is knowledgeable makes an effort to correct the inaccuracies on the page, they have been attacked with ongoing and relentless efforts to try to prevent their edits from remaining on the page. The record is very clear in that regard. (Again, as anyone can see, you have removed or erased the history for this page up until two reverts you did late on Jan 4, 2006)

You ask me """"why did you use this disclaimer"""". 

I wondered if those of you who have put up such a resistance to having more accurate information posted on this nitrites/poppers page, might have some personal hang ups or prejudices about some of the people whom they perceive as primarily using poppers recreationally. Are you homophobic?  Opposed to consenting adults making informed decisions about whether or not to have fun and take pleasure from something you may not agree with?  Anti-drug crusaders? Feel obliged to fight """"sin"""" and """"pleasure"""" wherever you find it, perhaps based on some deeply held religious beliefs? Or simply just believe that if you give people information, no matter how accurate it may be, that might indicate poppers may not be as harmful as some would like us to believe, that people will flock to them, and that somehow the end of the world will appear?  Much as in """"Reefer Madness""""?

The disclaimer was meant to try to appease those fears.  Unlik",0

Notability of Samantha Gauge
A tag has been placed on Samantha Gauge, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

I propose """"Muhammad was born about the year 570[8] and his birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi' al-awwal.[44] He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan, part of the Quraysh tribe, and was one of Mecca's prominent families; although it appears the clan was less prosperous during Muhammad's early lifetime.[14][45] Tradition places the year of Muhammad's birth as corresponding with the Year of the Elephant, which is named after the failed destruction of Mecca by the Aksumite king Abraha who supplemented his army with elephants. Alternatively some 20th century scholars have suggested different years, such as 568 or 569.[47]"""". Thoughts?   """,0

"RE: Deletion of 2004 Australian Election results 

Galloglass, I understand your concerns. However, the only example of the retention of previous electoral results was with the Bennelong example (which is a historically important seat; oweing to the fact that the previous minister was indeed Prime Minister Howard, who had held for the seat over 3 decades, and no other PM has lost his seat since Stanely Bruce) so I therefore felt it would be widely understood that the removal of the previous election results from the page would be acceptable.

I have looked at your history and you seem to be a real Wikipedia editor. The person who is accused of being a sockpuppet of mine is known to me but other than that we have no connection by blood, business or anything else. 

The attack on every contribution I have made (107) pages covering a wide range of topics has been organised by a group called """"Dissident Action Group Exposed"""". Over the years they have distributed smear letters over the internet saying I am a child molester, blow up churches and other such nonsense. Do a yahoo search if you doubt my word.

 Farting 

I reverted this article back to a recent version that contained the term fart. Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia (not a medical one), and its important to use a term that a majority of people know. Flatulence is no more or less a """"proper"""" term than farting is, and its definetly not slang  its use is too common, everyday, and widespread. It would be a misservice the readers to simply ignore this important term. Its such a odd thing to want to sensor.
  
I agree. Why use the word """"flatus"""" all over the place? People don't know it's fart. Doctors know it's fart, and, well, doctors are people, but they ain't most people. The common term is fart or gas.  —   | Talk

I agree, especially since the rest of the article doesn't seem to conform to the extreme citation standards in the Dietary section. Additionally, some of the stuff is a given and doesn't really need a citation unless you happen to be an alien from another planet who is completely unfamiliar with Earth, in which case it remains a mystery how this alien learned enough english to understand this article without learning some basic information about humans and Earth.

Well here I sit a broken hearted, came to shit, but only farted. That was one of the greatest poems ever!!! Got a 3 hour standing ovation back in 1956 at the convention center in San Antonio God it was good. Some times I think shiting was Gods way of making a joke with mankind you know. Excuse me oh bartender I will take another Jack and coke thanks!!! O.K where were we, oh yes licking me naked. The avenges Wikipedia official can't keep there figures off my ass cheeks like lick me all night you know. A sexy good looking girl totally naked, hairless between the lags.",1

 WikiProject Oregon 

About this editI'm sorry you thought being moved to """"inactive"""" status meant that you had to leave the project. Nothing could be further from the truth. In order to make the membership list easy to maintain, we happen to have created some artificial criteria for the active list and although you certainly contribute a lot to Wikipedia in general, at the time, I couldn't find any participation in Oregon-related articles. In the interests of ease of maintenance of the list (most people show no interest in such a thankless task and have no opinion about how it is managed), I never bothered to inform folks when they had been moved, but that was probably a mistake. Needless to say, you are a very active Oregon Wikipedian, especially in the area of the WikiWednesday group and the legislative stuff, and that certainly counts for a lot. I've taken the liberty of moving your name back into the active participants list, but feel free to change that if you're not comfortable. We've started a long-overdue discussion about the participants list on the WP:ORE talk page, and I'd really welcome your input.
 
It's unfortunate that we were being sort of cliqueish last time you participated there. Note that my efforts at clarifying who was who in that conversation got totally screwed up. In the first instance, I was trying to tell you that you were a part of the group toomy """"quote marks"""" had nothing to do with a critique of how you addressed our gender. But when I did wish to clarify that AM was male and I was femaleand that was merely for your edification so you could avoid awkward grammarit came across as short and snappish, as I had otherwise said all there was to say about my opinion in the matter. And then I got busy and never clarified my comments further. I'm really sorry if you felt ganged-up on and I hope you will come back. Cheers! P.S. I hope to make it up to WikiWednesday again one of these days soonso many projects, so few vacations days...   """,0

"You don't need to use  every time, and you definitely don't need it on my page. -) In any case, at first glance, it appears that you've included sufficient independent sourcing to establish the notability of the article, so I suspect it will be ok. I don't have the final word on that, of course  the decision ultimately belongs to the community.

"I do not agree with any of your statements. (1) There is no such thing as an *infinitesimal*. (2) 1-0.999... is not an infinitesimal, it is an indeterminate real value greater than 0. If this shocks you, why does it not also shock you that pi is also indeterminate. You can only approximate pi. (3) Therefore 1-0.999... > 0. 

Tango: There are infinitely many numbers between 0.999... and 1 - check the archives and you will find a clear example. You are incorrectly assuming that the limit of a series determines a number. If you insist on defining a number by a series (in fact this is circular), you must be consistent: what is the limit of any irrational number defined as a Cauchy sequence? You do not know, therefore you cannot use this definition. Furthermore, the apparatus for comparing numbers in decimal form must be consistent. You start wih the most significant digit in the representation and continue the comparison until you find two digits that are not equal. Having 0.999... = 1, contradicts this method. You must also remember that it is impossible to represent all numbers in any radix system. Most numbers can only be approximated. And if this is so, why would anyone foolishly insist on having 0.999... = 1? 98.195.24.26",0

"The Saskatchewan Party has absolutely nothing to do with Grant Devine or the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan.  They are completely seperate entitites.  Maybe *you* personally associate Devine with wrongdoing, but you do not speak for the electorate or anyone in the Province of Saskatchewan other than yourself.  

And once again, it is completely innappropriate for civil servants to be protesting the actions of their employer publicly.  Public criticism of your employer in any business is usually grounds for dismissal.  The only civil servants dismissed by the Government of Saskatchewan during the Devine era, aside from normal layoffs and workforce reductions, were those who violated their sworn responsibility of impartiality and loyalty to the duly elected government, and rightfully so.

By the way, the Devine legacy is looking better and better all the time with the incompetence of Lorne Calvert's government rearing its ugly head, most recently, with a $500 million privatization scheme concerning Crown Corporations.",0

I hope it's clarified. The ideas were connected in my head, but I did not mean to imply that you want PHG banned solely or even predominantly because of incivility. I agree that PHG needs to better accept criticism and learn a thing or two about reliable sourcing (hence my emphasis on OWN and RELIABLE), but I have yet to see the evidence (which isn't to say it doesn't exist) that he """"pour[s] bad information and fringe theories into Wikipedia"""". Also, to say that your main focus is not his incivility, while true, ignores the fact that it was brought up enough at ArbCom to generate a """"reprimand"""" and it has been brought up since at various talk pages as he re-invigorates old issues. And another thing, you must realise that he personally targets you because he feels personally targeted? I have tried to advise PHG to leave this whole topic area well alone for a while (~a year) until heads have utterly cooled. This won't work, however, if you follow him around tagging his articles, like the France-Japan one. Whatever the merits or value of that (I'm unsure either way yet), it demonstrates the need for a better and broader solution than the current ArbCom one. Frankly, I like your sourcing amendment, I'd even consider lessening the length of the ban if PHG were willing to comply with your amendation for the good of the project, since I think sourcing is the major issue here.

AMG
Let me spell something out for one problematic user. This user claims that """"not to use AMG to source genres, as they list overall genres for an artist, not an indivitual work"""". This statement would be true  if the genres listed on Artist's page were identical to the listed genres on this album, which obviously are not. Do all albums list the same genres as the disputer claims? The answer is obvious, hope the user  finds out. I hope the disputer will consider that his opinion is not a fact but a baseless claim and even """"Any user using them should be trout slapped even when explained."""" can't be considered as a serious argument but a hateful claim of a person with prejudice against this particular website.

Good article.  I suggest referencing the equipment section (in cased I missed a reference, sorry) and adding more verifiable information.
