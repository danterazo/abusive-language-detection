Hello, Kuno Klamm, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one of your contributions does not conform to Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View policy (NPOV). Wikipedia articles should refer only to facts and interpretations that have been stated in print or on reputable websites or other forms of media.

There's a page about the NPOV policy that has tips on how to effectively write about disparate points of view without compromising the NPOV status of the article as a whole. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have!

 Lead needs to meet MOS standards 

As it stands, the lead breaks MOS in several major ways:

 MOS:INTRO#Introductory text - In that is does not """"briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article"""".
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - In that it gives WP:UNDUE emphasis to male rape in the UK, yet section in """"Prevalence"""" covers 6 countries from which other examples could have been given. To quote MOS, """"emphasis given to material should reflect its relative importance to the subject"""" – male rape in the UK is no more important that in any other country in the world, therefore it should not be used as a singular example because this does not represent a worldwide view, particularly as anything related to anal sex differs per culture, religion and by law.
 The examples break the MOS:INTRO#Provide an accessible overview guideline which states: """"Do not hint at startling facts without describing them."""" The UK percentages are quoted without sufficient background to explain their relevancy this early in the article, there is no context because the lead is very short and uninformative.
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - """"Significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article"""" – the stated UK <3% and <5% figures are not mentioned in Male rape#United Kingdom, which would be a more appropriate place to account for these percentages, than in the lead in this disconnected manner.

The lead needs rewriting be someone who has contributed to this article and knows the sources well, it should be much longer based on the article's current length, it should be balanced and not given to undue examples from cherry-picked county data, per WP:NPOV. It needs to give a concise overview of the topic, rather than focusing on too many examples, to avoid clutter. 82.8.252.13  """,0

Gotcha.  You're saying if it went Republican, it did so against the net effects of the Jews.  What I'm trying to tie in here is if enough Jews """"defected"""" to make the difference e.g. if 80% of Jews going Dem became 60% because [Bush/W. Bush/etc...] had enough appeal.  I'm claiming Jews can influence a race not only by going solidly Dem, but also by deciding not to.  The article I cited states the amount of time candidates spend on Jews is precisely because they (~20% of them) are swayable.  That being the case, narrow Republican victories could also be a result of Jewish response to a candidate.

This being the case, 2000 Florida could be a result of Jewish voters if either: (1) enough Jews were attracted to W. Bush to throw the state, (2) the state actually went Democratic by voter intents (again this is possible but contentious, or (3) Jews made the race close enough to require Supreme Court intervention, which is itself a political outcome and has profoundly influenced the voting method there, as well as affected ideas about W. Bush.  If any one of these three is possible, we can't discount the effect of the Jewish vote in Florida 2000.  """,0

 God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh  

The article states that """"The text of Genesis relates that God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh.""""  And I agree if you do a casual reading of English translations.  However, some commentaters, notably E. W. Bullinger, argue that the six days describes the creation of the new world after the """"world that was"""".  I have researched and understand Bullinger's argument.  I will present it here.

NIV:

Ge 1:1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

KJV:

 Ge 1:1  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

Now, the English word """"formless"""" in the NIV and the english words """"without form"""" in the KJV are translations of the Hebrew word tohu, G/K Number H9332 and Strong's Number H8414.  The Strongs Concordance lists one of the meanins of toho as """"to lie waste"""" or simply """"waste.""""  

Likewise, the english word """"empty"""" in the NIV and the english word """"void"""" in the KJV is translated from the Hewbrew bohu, G/K Number H983 and Strong's Number H922.  Strong's Concordance provides one of the definitions of bohu as ruin.

Consequently, it is argued that the verses could be considered something like ~ """"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was waste and ruin, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.""""

Furthermore, Bullinger's observations continue to, and link 2Pe3:6, which states (KJV) 2Pe3:6 """"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.""""  Bullinger believes that this is a reference to Ge1:1-2, and not the flood during Noah's time.  He concludes with """"The creation in eternity past, to which all fossils and remains belong.""""  (Companion Bible, page 3).

Consequently, the articles should include, in my opinion, the fact that some theologians reject the young Earth on literal grounds.

See the Bullinger's side notes [].

Also, a quick google search will show that other literal interpreters [] with Bullinger.  

To summarize:  The article should be changed to reflect the fact that some literal interpreters of the Bible do not think the Earth is roughly 6000 years old.   Vacuous Poet""",0

But first tell me: do these numbers take into account the change in currency, so that values in DM get automatically converted to Euros if I simply go multiplying year after year? Or will an input in DM also output in DM? Because I think the best thing is for currencies to not be converted, requiring the user to do a conversion by hand, as it would be quite difficult to keep track of which currency was valid for which year.

I think that the reputation of the Marine Corps has more to do with its actual historical performance on the battlefield, rather than considerations such as the selectivity of its recruitment or basic training, something that probably would distinguish it in the """"European"""" perspective that you cite.
Another consideration is the scope, size and responsibility of the Corps.  The Marine Corps is not and has never been organized across its entire organization as a """"special-operations-type"""" organization, such as the SEALs, Special Forces, or, if you will, Royal Marines or SAS.  The article points out that the Corps is larger than the British Army in its entirety.  What the Marine Corps has done for most of its history, and what has distinguished it largely from the US Army, is serve as a mobile and convenient expeditionary force, in coordination with the Navy, in a large number of small actions in support of US policy, most of them in the Western Hemisphere or in Asia.  (THe US didn't even maintain a large standing peacetime Army until after 1945).  Outside those years when a major war was being fought (technically, the US Congress has declared war only five times in history), if someone saw an armed American in their country, that person was likely to be a Marine.
I would argue that the most relevant perspective on the reputation of the Marine Corps would be the perspectives and memories of its historical enemies.  I would invite anyone interested, and will work myself, to find and document in this article reliable quotes and sources of those who have encountered Marines in battle.

"""Danny you said above about my complaint of POV scriptures inserted: """"In one comment he claims it's POV to use scripture to validate JW beliefs then in the next he says they don't support those beliefs! Which is it?"""" It's both Danny! They are not mutually exclusive. You have inserted a plethora of scriptures to try and validate JWs' doctrines. You and others are well aware that the vast majority of Bible scholars do not agree with that use of the Bible and they say it's misused, and misquoted over and over by JWs. That is why scriptures should not be there. 1. The Bible does not back up JW doctrine, so it is not a valid reference, and 2. It should not be misused (as it is now) to manipulate the public into thinking that the Bible validates JWs' teachings. These many, many scriptures have only been inserted to try and influence the readers; they are not there for any valid reference, or a back-up to JW doctrine, they are just propaganda.

If they are to stay, then you, or someone, should put an equal link to discussions that state these JWs' doctrines are not majority scripture based, and there are plenty of sites to choose from. Balance is the key, if there are to be many misused POV scriptures over and over again, row after row, then there has to be for balance an equal number of links to scholarly discussion contradicting JWs interpretation of those scriptures, and how they in the vast majority do not back up JWs doctrine. At the moment, Danny, you are trying to turn this entire article into a Watchtower magazine, packed with misquoted scriptures and no discussion making any proven point that these scriptures are backing up JWs' doctrines. Just the usual dump a scripture and run routine, it's not acceptable Danny, you may think any form of propaganda is ok as your religion teaches that, but keep it in your own magazines, please don't infect a public domain with it (I'm sure this will fall on deaf ears).

You made another comment """"Either way, it isn't a point of view, but an indisputable fact that JWs use the Bible as the primary source of their doctrines and beliefs."""" Come on Danny, you know your comment is highly incorrect and very deceitful. Take a look at their predictions, where are they in the Bible, didn't Russell have a fetish for pyramids and made predictions based on their measurements? 

1. demonstrate where 1899, 1874, 1878, 1914, 1918, 1925, 1975 etc, are """"an indisputable fact that JWs use the Bible as the primary source of their doctrines and beliefs""""?
2. Or Where does the Bible divide 'major and minor' blood parts, and say one is ok, and the other a grave sin? I can't find that in my Bible, can you show me please? Or plasma is a sin, but breaking it down is ok, or that red blood cells are a sin to use, but using the 99% haemoglobin in them is ok? Or that animal blood is a sin, but processing cows blood into products is and using them is ok? You get the picture Danny, and there are pages and pages more that scholars agree have no basis in the Holy Bible are all. Please refrain from making silly emotional claims that will end up with egg on your face.

You say more: """"While many disagree with JW interpretation of the Bible, it is important that WP readers see how JWs use scriptures"""", except Danny, they do not see that, there are no justifying explanations, just a scriptures dropped in, and then run along to the next one before they have time to think. For each scripture, there should also be a link to a scholarly discussion that is contrary to JWs interpretation to give a rounded balance of coverage, if you oppose this, you have proven your motives are not pure, but agenda seeking for religious promotion, not balanced articles in a public domain, thus proving that these inserted scriptures are POV and should not be there. Why can't a belief just be """"they believe x, y, z.""""? You are not discussing scriptures and there is not room on Wikipedia for that, so why try and manipulate by dropping them in controversially, and then running away with no justification for they reference?  8th of September 2005

Here is a new revised entry to go at the top of the """"Son of Perdition"""" page representing all of the mainstream interpretations of the term for comment.

(Mormon's need not comment as it is about the mainstream positions, and the Mormon position is already covered.)

________

""""Son of Perdition"""" edit

According to orthodox Jewish and Christian eschatological beliefs, and secular historians and scholars, the concept of the Son of Perdition (also called """"the beast that goes into perdition"""" in Revelation  and ) is used in the Bible in one or more of three contexts, forming a triunism (or trinity,http://www.nathan.co.za/message.asp?sermonum=10 or typology) of three potential interpretive references.

First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes

Many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt [see Book of Daniel]. These scholars say that the Old Testament reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the First Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying """"Theos Epiphanes"""" (God manifest), etc. Even those who advocate an interpretation of Daniel that includes the Roman Empire in their interpretations of Daniel recognize Antiochus as a prototype of """"antichrist.""""http://www.endtime-truth.com/studies2.html

In Revelation  and , John borrowed the """"Son of Perdition"""" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to """"the star that fell from heaven"""" Revelation  by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. (Revelation ) The Greek name is """"Apollyon"""" (Greek: Aπολλυων), from the Greek root word """"apollumi"""" (Greek:απολλυμι) It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation."""" [Strong's 622] The Hebrew name is """"Abaddon"""" (Greek: Aβαδδων), from the Aramaic root word """"'abad"""" (Hebrew transliteration:שׁא), which means the same thing as the Greek root word. [Strong's 07] Daniel  says that the eventual destiny of the """"great beast"""" is to be slain, and his body """"destroyed"""" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (generally accepted by religious scholars to be a reference to hell).

Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot

In John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the """"son of perdition"""". The New International Version translates the phrase as """"the one doomed to destruction."""" D. A. Carson suggests that this verse refers both to Judas' character and to his destiny.D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Leicester: Apollos, 1991), 563. The phrase is also used in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, where it is equated with the Man of Sin.

Third frame of reference: Antichrist

In 2 Thessalonians , Paulwriting well after both Jesus and Judas had come and gone to their respective destiniesreferred to """"the Son of Perdition"""" in some future sense from the point in time in which he wrote his epistle. He also equated this person with the Man of Sin.

Likewise, In Revelation  and , John, writing well after Jesus and Judas Iscariot had come and gone to their respective destinies, refers to """"the beast that goeth into perdition."""" Assuming a futuristic mode of interpretation, this would also be a reference to a future figure.

In some variations of Christian eschatology, this future figure is commonly referred to as """"antichrist,"""" the """"false messiah,"""" or the """"false christ.""""

The following statements are archetypal, and do not reflect every organizational or individual variation:

The article was not deleted. It was moved to the article incubator as a result of this discussion because the film has not yet been released. If I had not done this then the article most likely would have been deleted. The article is at Wikipedia:Article Incubator/Kunjaliyan. You are welcome to work on it there and when the film is released and/or it gets more coverage then it can be moved back into article space.   

 User:Amyabaker/Noddle 
 I received this message. But, as you fully protected page   

Anthony, you were involved at User talk:Amyabaker/Noddle. I think the full protection in this situation is uncontroversial enough that you can unprotect it yourself. I will have to log off soon, and I'd like to post the changes now instead of later.   
   
Thank you! I have updated the draft with my changes.   

I'll trust Anthony's judgement on this matter but normally it's reasonable to protect pages that are temporarily restored for DRV.   
I understand that pages restored for DRV are generally protected. However, because this was a speedy deletion, and because I had addressed the speedy deletion reason with a rewrite, I think it was a good application of unprotection.   

 An AFD you closed was restarted two days later 

You closed Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/World of Books Ltd as No consensus, and Phearson, who said delete in that debate, two days after your close opened a new AFD at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/World of Books Ltd (2nd nomination).  Can you speedy close this and warn him of the rules?

 List of products in The Simpsons 

Hello George. I see you've been actively making additions to List of products in The Simpsons. It is good that you're enthusiastic about the list. However, I would like to suggest that you might be going a bit overboard. There are literally thousands of products and stores in The Simpsons that are seeing in single shots as throwaway jokes, etc. If one were to list them all, the list would be fairly bulky and useless (this has happened on other Simpsons lists already and have had to be cut back). I'd like to suggest the following guidelines:
Stores aren't products, so I would suggest you not list stores such as """"Herman's Military Antiques"""".
Bulk groups of products like the """"many antiques at Herman's Military Antiques"""".
Do not include real-world products like """"English Muffins"""". If you do that, it's pointless. Everything in the house is a product. TVs, couches, drapes, carpet, etc. Besides which, I would argue that noone in the world would ever need to look up whether English muffins are sold on the Simpsons. Real world products are assumed to exist on the show since it is rarely shown otherwise.
The list should really be for Simpsons-invented brand-names or invented products.

The next issue is subjective, but I believe crucial to keeping the list from spiraling out of control:
Products on the list should only be included if they are used more than once on the show. Throwaway jokes like Itchy & Scratchy Land Personalised License Plates are basically just describing a joke on the show. The list is really designed more for things like Laramie cigarettes, squishys and things that make up the Simpsons lore than a list of throwaway jokes. That doesn't mean some of your edits aren't perfect for the list; I believe you added """"Radioactive Man Comics"""", """"The Springfield Shopper"""" and """"Li'l Bastard Kits"""". These are great ones, but things like """"Disemboweller IV"""" needn't be included.

I am going to be deleting some of the ones that fall into the bullet point list above (real-world items and bulk groups) but I'm not going to immediately delete single-appearance items, but I suggest you join a discussion at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject The Simpsons#List of products in The Simpsons.

"""::The purpose of this discussion on the proposed intervening section is to illuminate the controversial conclusions and impression that readers took away from the story, because they conflated the reported claims of the DI as described in the story with independently verifiable facts.  The analysis by  Skip Evans illustrates this confusion and provides a reliable source that the claims of the DI are not necessarily valid.  That's one way to establish the controversial nature of stories about the DI which contrast the published claims of the DI to published remarks by signatories like Salthe and Davidson ridiculing the DI's interpretation.

If you want a reliable source that the article by Chang is controversial in its own right, on multiple points, you can take a look at the article's Ask Science Q&A; page on the NYT wherein Chang responds to commentary and criticisms of his piece, and admits that parts of it are slanted toward highlighting the anti-evolution signers and not the pro-evolution ones.  Chang says, """"This article focused on Discovery's petition and thus I did not interview evolution supporters.""""

Elsewhere, you have good evidence that there are evolution supporters among the 103 initial and subsequent signers, notably including Bob Davidson, whose story came to light and is featured in the main Wikipedia entry on the Darwin Dissent Controversy.

This intentional snubbing of evolution-supporters among those interviewed by Chang for comments misleads readers about the statistical mix of those who signed the petition, giving some people the impression (per the desires of the DI) that all signers are variously """"anti-evolution"""" or """"Darwin dissenters.""""  The contemporaneous analysis by Skip Evans reinforces that element of the controversy.

When one realizes that Chang focused the story on the anti-evolution signers (many of whom joined after DI went public, and when one observes that Chang fails to solicit a quote from Picard (even though he mentions her name), one is left wondering which side of the fence she (and others of the 103) reside on.  The purpose of all this is to cast doubt on the unverified presumption (suggested by the existing section which I am forbidden from touching) that Picard belongs to the anti-evolution dissenters.  In other words, I am saying that some of the Wikipedia editors evidently fell into the trap which the DI set, luring readers into believing that all 103 scientists adhered to DI's dubious characterization of them.  

The length of the intervening piece needs to be longer than the section it precedes, because the current section adopts without proof the thesis that Picard is among those belonging to the anti-evolution dissenters.  The proposed intervening section is designed to examine the evidence for the unproven thesis adopted in the existing section and determine whether the evidence for it is credible or conclusive.  As you well know, a proof is typically longer than the theorem.  What's in the proposed intervening section is an examination of the omitted proof, in which the outcome appears to be that the missing proof does not seem to exist, and in fact there is good evidence at hand that the dubious thesis adopted by the existing section is simply false (and therefore unprovable).  If it is false, then it is also potentially libelous. Therefore, establishing the truth or falsehood of the thesis is crucial in order to protect Wikipedia from inadvertently publishing false and defamatory material that slipped through the filters intended to examine the evidence with a keenly skeptical eye.

What any Wikipedia editor happens to know for a fact about the status of the petition in the intervening years is not evidence that anyone whose name appeared in nationally printed ads back in 2001 had the slightest inkling of what the DI was up to in the meantime.  Perhaps Wikipedia editors found this out by doing painstaking research on the DI.  Stanley N. Salthe said in 2006 in the Times article we are examining that he had never heard of the DI.  That's well-sourced evidence that some of those who signed had no clue that the DI even existed, let alone was maintaining a growing list of names.  Therefore one cannot draw any verifiable conclusions about what most of the 103 original signers knew of the DI prior to the 2006 Times story.  

One of the reasons the story is controversial is because it fails to point out that the DI had reprised and evolved a 2001 petition that predated any of the disputed assertions regarding its inherent meaning or its re-interpretion as a testimonial in favor of DI's political agenda.

The two sources which establish the controversial nature of the story are the above mentioned [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/0",0

"WP:MOSMED is the Manual of Style for articles that come under any of the Medical categories. All medical-related articles have to comply to reach Good Article (GA) or above (hehe - I only found out about it at the second GA Review!).
Try typing 'Paul Bert' into the search box in the left column of any page and click the 'Search' button (rather than pressing Enter or clicking the Go button). You'll get the search results - the article Paul Bert is first, and Oxygen toxicity is fourth. If you click the Go button instead, you go direct to the article if it exists, otherwise you get the search results as before. Try the same test searching for 'Paul Bert effect'.
There is an article on Decompression sickness - we plan to tackle that after we have finished getting Nitrogen narcosis to GA. No need to mention those in Oxygen toxicity - although all of them are summarised in Scuba diving#Effects_of_breathing_high_pressure_gas.
The partial pressure of oxygen is the trigger for OxTox: that is found by multiplying the fraction of oxygen by the ambient pressure at the depth you're at. For example, air is 21% oxygen and the pressure at 50 metres is 6 bar. So you have a partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) of 0.21 x 6 = 1.26 bar. That's safe from CNS OxTox as it's never been observed at less than 1.3 bar. Divers may use gas mixtures different from air, however - take a look at Nitrox for more information.

You, however, choose to define """"reference"""" very liberally, and take it to mean that Wikipedia should never include anything about Wikipedia, which of course is silly. 
Somehow you've come to believe you are the last word on what is and is not relevant, despite press coverage and vast consensus to the contrary. McCarthyism is alive and well on Wikipedia. What's funny is these little witch hunts for irrelevance are so restricted in scope, and totally arbitrary in their focus. Do us a favor and go take your fervor over to Christina Aguilera.

Lead, do you actually think the entire article is POV or do you think specific sections are? IMHO, the tags that were used were not legitimate. First, I have heard no editor state the entire article is POV. Second, if there is not  specific list of legitimate areas of correction, the tag is meaningless. Third, it is not appropriate to use tags unless others support the claims being made. Personal preference is not a legitimate reason to use tags.

In my own defense: A man has a right to his opinion. I do feel Timothy Usher is a bigot. I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...

The current full official names of the organization are simply Ezras Torah in Hebrew and Torah Relief Society in English as can be seen at http://www.ezrastorah.org/about_us.php and in their mailings.  

(Mossad) Ezras Torah was founded in August 1915 and was known by that name in numerous Yiddish and Hebrew news articles, advertisements and publications from the early 20th century.  Ezras Torah's own publications (see the links to the hebrewbooks.org documents on the wiki page) also mention just Ezras Torah without any addendum.  One can also see """"Ezras Torah Fund"""" without any additional title listed in page 45 of the following PDF document American Jewish Yearbook, 1921-1922 (Directories).
The organization was incorporated in early 1920 under the name Torah Relief Society.  The incorporation document can be found in New York City's Division of Old Records in Manhattan.

I can think of three possibilities re: """"for Relief of European and Palestinian Rabbis""""
1) The 1936 volume by Julius Caesar Schwarz was giving a description and not adding to the title
2) That book was in error
3) Ezras Torah had a different official name in the mid-20th century (this would need to be supported by official documents or from material published by Ezras Torah)

If either of the first two possibilities were correct then the later English language publications listed above might have just copied the lengthened organization name from earlier English language sources without consulting more authoritative sources.

"Muhammad's teacher
I know this is quite difficult to accept for you muslims, but, as it is, this guy was (one of several) Muhammad's teacher. This is an irrefutable fact of history. I realise that the idea of Muhammad having a teacher beside Allah is some kind of heresy for you, but, here's the truth: Muhammad had an Assyrian Christian teacher. Muhammad learned a lot from him. I am not misrepresenting any source by pointing out this well known fact amongst theologians. It may be so, that Sargis Bkheera did not teach Muhammad about everything, but Muhammad gleaned a lot from him.

Here's what AINA says:

633 A.D. (5383)
Muhammad declares himself the prophet of God and originates Islam. It is well known that Muhammad's principal teacher was the Assyrian monk Sargis Bkheera. This accounts for the extraordinary doctrinal similarity between some aspects of Islam and the Assyrian Church of the East. For example, according to Assyrian Church doctrine, there is no awareness of passage of time between the moment of death and final judgement; final judgement occurs immediately even though thousands of years may have passed on Earth. Islam holds this same view. It is also noteworthy that the Koran states that in the day of final judgement the angels of Allah will speak to man in Assyrian.http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/timeline.htm''

Where do you think Muhammad got that from? Of course, he got it from his Assyrian Christian teacher. You want this referenced from some academic work? I'm sure that's no problem. Here you go, take your pick:  He was Muhammad's teacher. Stop reverting unless you have some source refuting this claim.

Due to space limitations and the need to purchase mobile units to accomplish integration at the elementary school level, the Federal District Judge in Greensboro gave a year delay for the integration of the elementary schools.
The principals of Durham County's high schools were all employed during legal segregation. A lot of discussion took place by whites and African Americans in the Durham community about how successful the process of integration would be in Durham County.

"Regarding AZ helping Ahmed Ressam get to Canada  my reading of his CSR Transcript is exactly the opposite.  He asked Ahmed Ressam if he could get him five (stolen?) Canadian passports, because he was tired of being a stateless person in Pakistan.

Regarding whether AZ ran the Khaldan camp  didn't he testify that he hadn't paid a visit to Khaldan for years?  I thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camp's management team.

A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order, and officially informs them that they have been admitted.  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training.  And, once they finished their training, he helped those who wanted to go fight in Chechnya or Israel to slip into those conflict zones.  He had helped grads slip into Bosnia, during the civil war there.

Thomas Nelson, Sr.

Does anyone know whether or not Mr. Thomas Nelson, Sr., age 111, currently residing in Texas, formerly of Louisiana, served in the military before, during or after World War I?  Can anyone provide any further biographical information on Mr. Nelson  where he was born, where he lives now, etc.?  Finally, can anyone post links to any articles about Mr. Nelson?  Any information would be appreciated.

Well, let's look at what Ancestry says:-
There are 13 Draft Cards for WWI for a Thomas Nelson, of Louisiana 6 of which fit into the age category. There are other bits & pieces of information that can then be found from there, providing that is the correct info. Have you got any more details - middle name, initial, date of birth etc. to help us so we can help you?

Why speculate?  It was never mentioned anywhere that he is a WWI veteran.  He runs a candy store.  However, Silas Simmons is a closer candidate, based on what he said about 'loading ammunition' during WWI (at the shipyards). 

Why speculate?  Because he's in the right age range, and if there's a chance he served we sould check it out.  What's this about him running a candy store?

Thomas Nelson spent most of his life running a candy store.  He doesn't strike me as someone who would have served.  He is African-American.  →  {yakłtalk} 

""""Doesn't strike you?""""  Keep in mind the draft was in full force at the time, it didn't matter what you did.   

I agree  that kind of speculation is bizarre.  If you had the opportunity to meet and talk with him, Robert, why didn't you just ask him if he'd served?  What is it about running a candy store that makes someone unlikely to be called up for the draft?  Does he have a draft card on file?

One would think that if he served, the news article would have mentioned it.  But I find your statements hypocritical vis-a-vis the Silas Simmons comment. 

Silas Simmons?

Who is Silas Simmons?

Silas Simmons was born Oct 14 1895, according to his WWI draft card:

Name: Silas Joseph Simmons 
City: Philadelphia  
County: Philadelphia  
State: Pennsylvania  
BirthPlace: Delaware  
Birth Date: 14 Oct 1895  
Race: African  
Roll: 1907647  
DraftBoard: 27  

→  {yakłtalk} 

http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/16/Neighborhoodtimes/A_senior_among_seniors.shtml

Note: During both World War I and World War II, he loaded live ammunition for U.S. troops onto ships bound for Europe.

He is not on the GRG list because the 1900 census lists him as born in '1897' (which would make him 'only' 108, instead of 110 as claimed).  However, it's possible the census in this case is incorrect.  In any case, he was still alive a month ago, has a WWI draft card, and participated in an activity which was directly related to the war effort.  Whether he is a 'veteran' or not, I don't know if he was drafted.  But considering some 'veterans' on the current list were little more than telephone operators and ROTC students, Silas's efforts were a tangible contribution to the war.  He was also a Negro league ballplayer.→  {yakłtalk} 

This is not a discussion of the relative merits of peoples' service.  It's merely a question of service.  A veteran is someone who served in the armed forces; it's irrelevant where he or she served and what exactly they did.  Do we know whether Mr. Simmons loaded ships as a civ",0

The making of humanity Robert Briffault Publisher G. Allen & Unwin ltd., 1919 Original from the University of California Digitized Oct 18, 2007
It must be admitted that, in recoil from the general conspiracy of silence of our histories, several writers who have sought to vindicate the claims of Arab culture have somewhat exaggerated the achievements of Arabian science. Against such loose panegyrics it has been objected, that Arab science produced no surpassing genius and no transcending discovery ; that it was derived from extraneous sources. That is substantially true, but entirely irrelevant. Arab astronomy did not forestall Copernicus or Newton, though without it there would have been no Copernicus and no Newton. Although the complexity of the Ptolemaic system was repeatedly criticized by Moorish astronomers, although Al-Zarkyal declared the planetary orbits to be ellipses and not circles, although the orbit of Mercury is in Al-Farani's tables actually represented as elliptical, although Muhammad Ibn Musa glimpsed in his works on Astral Motion and The Force of Attraction the law of universal gravitation, those adumbrations of the truth were not fruitful of any great reform. The only important facts brought to light by Arabian astronomy, the discovery of the movements of the sun's apogee by Al-Batani, and of the secondary variations of the moon's motion by Abu '1-Wafa, exercised no perceptible influence upon the course of research, and had to be rediscovered by Tycho. Ibn Sina is said to have employed an air thermometer, and1 Ibn Yunis certainly did use the pendulum for the measurement of time ; but neither of those devices, which were independently re- introduced by Galileo, can be counted as a contribution to the growth of science.

That, however, is entirely beside the point. The debt of our science to that of the Arabs does not consist in startling discoveries or revolutionary theories; science owes a great deal more to Arab culture, it owes its existence. The ancient world was, as we saw, pre-scientific. The astronomy and mathematics of the Greeks were a foreign importation never thoroughly acclimatized in Greek culture. The Greeks systematized, generalized and theorized, but the patient ways of investigation, the accumulation of positive knowledge, the minute methods of science, detailed and prolonged observation, experimental inquiry, were altogether alien to the Greek temperament. Only in Hellenistic Alexandria was any, approach to scientific work conducted in the ancient classical world. What we call science arose in Europe as a result of a new spirit of inquiry, of new methods of investigation, of the method of experiment, observation, measurement, of the development of mathematics in a form unknown to the Greeks. That spirit and those methods were introduced into the European world by the Arabs.
Is  Briffault's writing wp:npov? Not when cut and pasted, only when taken in context. The emphasis in this quote is mine, however wp:rs will show that systems and theories of science in the middle ages are those of Aristotle, Archimedes, Galen, Ptolemy, and Euclid. As for the spirit and methods we need a more neutral tone.",0

"That's right. - Why is that senseless division of one language to all those politically created 'standards', when they are 98% to 99% identical in all linguistical aspects? Everyone normal can see that fact by looking at the chart in the article, where the 3 'standards' are compared. There are just a few words that are different, which is even far under the level of being 3 dialects of a same language. There's absolutelly NO translations between serbian TV shows or movies that are broadcasted on bosnian and croatian TV, and vice-versa. And there will never be translations because it's same language. On the contrary, there are and will be translations when one of the SerboCroatian 'standards' is translated to the viewers in Slovenia or Macedonia, and vice-versa, because in this case it's a matter of 2 different languages.
Not accepting the facts that SerboCroatian is ONE language is a totally pathetic behavior, limited to the extreme nationalists, especially from the western part of this language speaking area. They are totally isolated, always fighting unsuccessfully with the rest of the world, and their failed propaganda is dying every coming day. The majority of Croatians, Bosnians and Serbians are, thanks God, normal people, who are absolutelly aware that they are speaking a SAME language, which is, by some suspicious political reasons called either serbian, croatian, bosnian, dalmatian, montenegrin or bunjevac.

"Hey there! I will indeed check that book - thanks! I don't know if this is the case, but perhaps a number of Wikipedians editing this page have a Cantonese background, it is probably awfully good to hear something even remotely suggesting that the language was once possibly really close to being the language of use in China - even if the statement might be false.

Ho hum, here we go. . . I see your inevitable desire to posit straw men has taken the better of you again (yawn). You stated: """"You obviously don't like JWs. . ."""" Actually Danny I have some friends who are JWs, and I have no problem with them as individual per se. If you actually opened your eyes for once you would see I have problems with your religious leaders, not JWs. Although rank and file JWs are still responsible for selling their literature and promoting the false teachings of the Watch Tower commercial publishing organisation. 

Your second reality admittance is very revealing, you said: """"I try to avoid thinking about things that I don't like or that make me upset."""" You sure do Danny, as do most JWs, and don't think it hasn't been noted by thousands of viewers of these pages. Very sad indeed when someone who claims he is part of the """"channel of God"""", and """"the only narrow road to salvation"""", shrinks back in fear whenever you see anything you don't like. This is exactly why so many in this world get deceived and trapped in false religions, they just look away when reality comes knocking. This is also why you will most probably waste the rest of your life in a region that is not what it claims to be and lose your future opportunities with God through self-deception. Danny, never underestimate the power of denial, it will steal all your relationship with God, and you will probably let that happen.

Danny, I will not argue with you, as you are not ready to see reality at present, I pray one day you will be able, but maybe that time is not yet. I will leave it with God, if he wants you, he will open your eyes. Until then, I will leave you with some advice from your own organisation; on this occasion, you should take that advice.

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply) 
Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)    

Dear River,
I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again!
Best regards,  (To reply) 
Thanks, Réginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page. I see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fair-use claims. I try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies, but if it gets added again I will see if it can be deleted on those grounds.

"""confess (even though I agree with the author that abstance doesn't work) this article is very POV, toward a liberal side. 

It's not POV if it's true

Just because there is controversy over a subject does               I LIKE WAFFLES                    not mean that a NPOV gives equal weight to both sides. If all (or nearly all) studies on a subject support one POV (as is clearly the case with abstinence; see Sex Education) , then while we should note that there is a controversy there is no reason not to write the most objectively true statements we can about it.

To say abstinence doesn't work is POV. In fact, studies have suggested that abstinence education does work. Abstinence education, for example, has been successful in Uganda. The Family Research Council has a few studies on this issue. Sure, the FRC is a conservative think tank but that doesn't mean its findings don't have validity or merit.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 154.20.204.92   

 Law Section needs work 

The section on laws appears to be complete rubbish.  I've attempted to rewrite it to make sense and be somewhat meaningful but it needs references, timeframes etc.  Who says that laws like this only reduce teenage pregnancy by 0.92%?  When did Texas pass its law?  Is it still valid?  What does the Texan law state are the punishments for teen-teen sex?  Give a case history where the punishment was as unequal as this article says.  What has been the effect of this law?

The original section said something about many goverments, states etc trying to pass these laws but they got killed(?) because of something to do with age of concent laws and human rights.  Give specifics.  Cite a Country/other body (and date and preferably leader of government) which tried to pass these laws and what happened.  Where such laws have been repealed give good examples.

Personally I'm tempted to remove the whole Laws section pending something more meaningful being written.  I'd fix the section myself but I don't have any information on what laws have been passed in this regard.

 Abstinence section 

The absitnence section is still suffering badly from POV problems (both before and after an extensive editing in the last two days).  The discussion of the debate about education belongs in Sex education, particullarly as this is very US-centric at the moment and there is a section there for that (it may be broken out to it's own article as well).  I've tried to edit the article on the whole to improve POV, but some help is still greatly needed  

Added UK-specific details
I've added quite a lot of UK stuff to the article: perhaps someone from the US could add some more detail about contrasting US policies? I've tried not to touch the bits about the causes of TP, so I hope the new stuff's not too POV. I've also deleted some stuff about marriage - I couldn't see what it added.  I'm really up for doing some more work on this article, if someone wants to get in touch to discuss some of the issues.   

Under 19
It may seem illogical, but teenage pregnancy is only considered as such if the mother is aged 18 or under at the time of conception, hence """"under 19"""" not """"under 20"""" - government interventions in the UK and elsewhere take this age bracket as the location of the """"social problem"""" to which this article refers.  It's not a copy-editing mistake, so I've reverted the previous change.  I'm also interested in the comment that """"the term used to apply to girls under 13 becoming pregnant"""" - I've never heard it used in this way in the UK, could you enlighten me? Thanks.   

I wish it was 21. I don't think it's possible to be ready for parenthood nowadays at that age, espeically with the rising cost of living. I also think that technically nineTEEN is still a teenager. They are also young adults, but they are still a teen. Most 19 year olds probably won't consider themselves teenagers and THAT is ok, but they are technically still that..a teen.

"::i was cautioned because i am inexperienced and was entrapped. the hostile editor i am dealing with deleted the entire article and substituted a polemical, inaccurate stub. the rules of wiki are voluminous, arcane, byzantiine and not at all user friendly.  they are easy to misunderstand for a beginner and easy to manipulate maliciously by an experienced wikipedian like bali. from my reading of the definition of vandalism, i thought bali deleting the entire article was against the rules and my putting it back with minor changes was completely legal. he basically entrapped me into a revert war. he was not punished, but  i was not just cautioned, but banned and told I must get consensus to make any further changes. since then the article has been frozen.

your other advice would be useful if this was an ordinary dispute with well meaning people who disagree.  or if the topic was indeed trivial.  it is not appropriate to walk away from an article on the Holocaust because there are malicious and hostile editors who want to falsify the record or, what is happening here, ban basic facts on the Holocaust.  this is not a topic where it is acceptable to let the bad guys win - for me. is it okay with wiki administrators?  

i don't think it is appropriate to use mediation with what are functionally Holocaust deniers. this has been going on for six months. posts asking for consensus are ignored. any post they see as a challenge is answered within minutes.  i did walk away for several months, and more recently for days at a time and there is no relief. there has to be another level of getting help at wiki for truly intractable problems like unreasonable, malicious attacks on Holocaust information.

not taking sides or even knowing the topic of the dispute is fine when the dispute is between two sincere editors. but what if the dispute is about incontrovertible, non-controversial Holocaust history and editors who have dedicated themselves to keep it out of wiki and also to drive sincere editors off the page, if not to discourage them from ever participating in wiki again?  this is much bigger than my individual problem or this one article.  this is a wiki problem of how to deal with malicious spoilers.  cimicifugia",0

"Mr Dahn, I would be only too happy to deal only with facts. 
-TABSaving 300 000 lives against the odds, the pressure and the sheer logic, if one is criminally antisemitic through and through, is a fact sir. 
-TABDismantling the Iron Guard, a declared antisemitic and pro-german organization, is another paradox
-TABMarying a Jewish lady as an antisemit, doesn’t make sense
-TABAllowing the Jewish community to have official representatives, to befriend at least one of them, the lider of that community and to lend him an attentive ear and to let him convince you to change some of the previously issued orders and laws, does not, again, fit into an antisemitic profile. 
-TABAllowing some of the deported Jews in Transnistria to be repatriated, is not, again, an act of an atisemite. (It is another unprecedented act; can you quote one single similar occurrence in an Europe under the german boot?)

Please explain this. My request is NOT rethorical. I do agree on your superior erudition in the matter, for all I know, you might be a historian, whereas I am just interested in history. And PLEASE don’t refer me to other books, reports, authors. Just give me your own opinion on the points above. Not your opinion that they do not matter, but how do you explain them? I accept your patronizing unpleasant as it may be, if you’ll just explain. 

And try to see my point: I DO accept the possibility of being wrong. I try to stay as objective as I can, but till now, I heard rather unilateral accusations, rather than specific proofs and facts. That’s the diference between us, when confronted with discrepancies, you sir seem to deliberately ignore them, because the authors you read do so; me, I start my own research. I have spoken personally to at least 50 people, who lived through those terrible times, not Jewish, unfortunately, but certainly not antisemitic. (It’s not much, but at least I did it; what’s YOUR personal research ?) They are spread over all major Romanian regions, my witnesses, covering many different trades. Not one, mind you, ever heard, much less witnessed, any antisemitic violence ORDERED BY ANTONESCU or his government on Romania – old territory. Please quote contrary evidence, first hand if possible. I confess, I couldn’t find Jewish witnesses, all my Jewish friends and aquaintances are too young for that, but I’m still looking. 

And excuse me, the accusation of “incomplete quoting” the Wiesel repport is ludicrous. Would you want me to quote the full text ? My point was that even in a report that I consider unilateral and biased (like a trial with prosecutors only and without defenders), important facts like apparently inexplicable acts of mercy and a definite orriginal Jewish policy, totally opposed to that of Germany, at a time when Germany was still all powerfull, could not be remained unnoticed. The Wiesel Commission itself, sir, could not ignore those facts; how can you ? 

The Wiesel Report allowed such colossal mistakes as blaming a whole state, a whole nation, I remember of having read the phrase “the crimes committed by Antonescu and the Romanian nation against Jews”. You never blame a whole nation, a whole population. 

 The blame sir, is INDIVIDUAL, as Frederic Forsythe says. And so is the salvation. 

An intelligent man knows that when you deal with great numbers, you have to apply statistics, over-generalization is one of the  most unforgivable acts. And such a phrase lies in the same report in which there are mentioned pro-Jewish acts, both from government level and from individuals, only to underline that they don’t count. And you want me to take such a report as gospel truth, a model of impartiality and justice ?

MR MIRCION, kindly, get a grip on yourself. To state that Antonescu is “my hero” proves you didn’t even tried to read what I wrote; if so, how and what are you criticizing ? 

I repeat, to be sure Antonescu was involved in war crimes. Commited in war zones. He was not involved in crimes against humanity, in cold-blood premeditated murder, based on an ethnic cleansing policy, on the contrary, he tried, and partially succeeded to stop it, against considerable political pressure and certainly against the major antisemitic trend in a Germany dominated Europe. He is to be condemned, of course, but NOT for the wrong reasons. At the time of the reckoning, both good and bad deeds should be put in the balance. Romanians, sir, have the right to criticize, accuse, and condemn Antonescu. Not the Jewish people from Romania-old kingdom, since Antonescu saved 300 000 of them while sending almost half a million of his own people to their death. 

To be sure, this is just my opinion, but it’s based on facts.

I feel that this is mostly a well written and informative article and that this whole coup or counter coup thing is pointless. These events are accepted by most sources to have been a coup. What this means is that Mossadeq is accepted to have been the leader of Iran at the time in question, and to have been deposed. The phrase counter-coup implies that Mossadeq deposed the Shah first, which according to the ample scholarship cited in this article, is not what happened. 
It is of course possible that the concensus of scholarship on this issue is in error, but those who beleive this to be the case are by definition, holders of minority viewpoints. 
That said, I do think Shervink's views are interesting and should be included (and noted as a minority viewpoint) in the article. This issue is generally seen as the west vs. Iran with the shah on the side of the west. A point of view more sympathetic to the monarchy is rarely heard.  Itsafarce",0

I can cast some light on:

1. CZMarlin's contribution 

CZMarlin is a tireless promoter of AMC vehicles (he owns at least two and has a website dedicated to AMC products). As he knows, I have developed the view that he seems to use the project quite persistently as a PR medium for the defunct corporation and its products. It is, I believe, to this end that, it seems to me, he has habitually fought against sourced material that brings neutrality and balance to articles on AMC products, e.g. AMC Pacer, Gremlin etc.  

It is true that I was deeply frustrated by the apparent determination with which he misrepresented others’ contributions in order to justify their deletion, e.g. . I was also frustrated by his apparent insistence on idiosyncratic and erroneous interpretations of the English language, and also by what appeared to be deliberately erroneous interpretation of verifiable facts, e.g.   errors that cannot be permitted in an  encyclopedia.  

My sincere belief that English was not CZM’s first language arose from the manner in which he uses it and the difficulties of communicating with him. (Examples on request.) I disagree that I belittled him for it – as a non-native English speaker myself, it's not something I would do.  Indeed I offered to help him with the language (offer ignored) and told him he could seek help from WP volunteer translators, so that he could write in Polish (also ignored).  

True, I ridiculed him when his behaviour seemed so extreme as to appear ridiculous to me.  I should not have done so. But we get frustrated when we try to work with an editor who, it seems, demonstrates provocatively scant regard for factual accuracy, neutrality, balance and clarity of communication . Granted, I should not have let my frustration show. 

The 'known vandal' CZM mentions is in fact an IP address used by one or more people. The address had a history of vandalism. When I saw a constructive edit from it I tried to encourage the contributor in her/his constructive behaviour; and later suggested the sandbox for experiments:  , . My posts encouraged constructive behaviour. 

CZM's damaging claim that these posts encouraged disruptive behaviour is totally false. (This gives a flavour of the difficulties I had with him.) It also casts serious doubt on the reliability of his contribution here, and also on his good faith.

He implies that my use of the term 'AMC cuckoos' was insulting. Not so, as he well knows, because I explained it to him when he showed that he had misunderstood the idiom: I used the term in an edit summary to describe the long-winded and inappropriate descriptions of certain AMC cars that he had introduced  like cuckoos in a nest  into an article on a certain aspect of automotive aerodynamics .

My  'another sophomoric CZM error' was mischievous but (IMO) harmless retaliation for CZM’s previous sniffy dismissal of some Google research I had posted to a discussion, which he denigrated as 'sophomoric research'. He seems to have forgotten that.  

The reference to 'little fuhrer' is more serious, and I should not have used it even though it mentioned no names (so no harm done to CZM’s reputation). Why that particular metaphor? I’m afraid I regarded CZM’s approach to editing as uncollaborative and perfunctory to the point of being dictatorial; and ruthless in its uncritical promotion of AMC and its products.

2. Collect’s contribution 

Just as he could list my transgressions (""""I have a list of [Writegeist's] comments""""), so also could I recite a litany of his own. Meh. Tit for tat gets us nowhere.

However it is worth noting that an antagonism grew between us at the Sarah Palin pages when it became apparent to Collect that I disagreed with much of his input, whereas he had assumed from one of my earliest contributions there that I would be an ally (he left an appreciative note on my Talk). Yet despite the difficulties between us, it was with scrupulous fairne",0

"""User:Ling.Nut has got his Sandbox (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ling.Nut/Sandbox) rewrite coming together. We've been working together on it and swapping ideas and suggestions, and I'm pretty happy with what he's got. My principle and perhaps only remaining concern right now is the concluding sentence in the lede:

 """"The unresolved political status of the Palestinian territories and their inhabitants, plus the concurrent refugee problem, are central issues of the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict.""""

I don't think """"unresolved political status"""" is a good phrase, because while true from a certain point of view, this could be interpreted by unfamiliar readers as meaning the territories are disputed, which is not the case. I've proposed a few alternatives:

 """"Another lasting consequence of the war that has had enormous repercussions and which helped establish the Six Day War as a watershed event in the Middle East was the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, which continues to this day.""""

 """"Another consequence that established the Six Day War as a watershed event in the Middle East is the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.""""

 """"The Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and its repercussions for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is another consequence that established the Six Day War as a watershed event in the Middle East.""""

Would like other editors' input on this. My main concern here is that to note consequences of the war in the lede but NOT mention the occupation would be a huge error of omission, since one could very easily argue this is the single most consequential result of the war, with incalculable repercussions, and not only for just the Middle East.

It's unfortunate that the history of Sicily here at Wiki is the sole province of this one individual, """"Racial Reality,"""" who is well-known amongst forum posters as being very biased against any research that shows admixture.  He feels he has the right to discredit all studies he disagrees with, and that everyone should accept his theories as absolute fact.  I could just as easily creat a website presenting an opposite view and discrediting studies that Racial Reality likes.  But I am not that dishonest.  My point was to present the other side of the story, while leaving Racial Reality's also valid side there as well; in this way, the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. But the way the article is now is extremely one-sided.

Blood group studies from the 1970's are not incorrect. This method has fallen out of fashion merely because it is less sensitive than the newer DNA method we have access to.  This fact doesn't discredit older studies that use blood groups, since the blood groups and blood proteins used are specific to certain populations.  Since the decoding of the human genome, we have access to more sensitive methods of determing admixture.  

An example of how blood groups studies are valid is the Duffy null marker. The Duffy blood-group types have been known for many decades, as has their usefulness in identifying continent of ancestry. But it has been only within the past decade that we have known that a person's Duffy blood-group type is encoded on the long arm of his/her chromosome #1, about 23.2 centimorgans out from the chromosome's centromere. 

In general, you can measure the end-result of a person's genetic makeup by serological analysis (blood group tests), or you can measure the actual genetic makeup itself in the DNA. The latter is more precise since some proteins are produced (or not) only in homozygotes and so are invisible to serological analysis but visible in the DNA. If anything, serological analysis will understimate true admixture. 

The Ghiani study specifically states that it shows significant admixture.  Anyone can see this when reading the abstract. However, what they mean by """"significant"""" is """"statistically significant"""", not that a large portion of Sicilians' DNA is African. Five percent or more is usually considered statistically significant.

The Calo study presents support for the east-west division in Sicily, and shows relatedness between Sicilians and Egyptians.  Egyptians were imported to Sicily during the Saracen period as farmers, so the connection between Sicilians and Egyptians is not spurious. The study's use of perfectly valid blood group and mtDNA studies which show sub-Saharan admixture in Sicily were merely to show that other studies found """"African"""" admixture there, regardless of whether it was sub-Saharan or North African.  There are other studies which lump the two together. The whole point was to show a relationship with the (diverse) peoples of the continent of Africa.

The Semino study from 1989 which found 4 sub-Saharan haplotypes out of a population of 91 diverse Sicilians is not """"problematic,"""" as Racial Reality would have us believe, but is a perfectly valid mtDNA study using restriction enzymes, a method still widely used today, since it is cost-effective and accurate.  RFLP's cut the DNA at specified locations, and """"indels"""" (insertion and deletions polymorphisms) are very easy to spot in this way. There are other studies that have found less (or in one case, no) sub-Saharan material in the Sicilian gene pool.  This is normal, since all samples are different, and because of this, all tests will yield different results.  One certainly can't """"refute"""" or """"overrule"""" the other.  The 2001 Vona study (finding no sub-Saharan genes in Sicilians) that referenced the 1989 Semino study did so for comparison purposes only.  Furthermore, it tested only 49 Siclians from the single villige of Alia.  No reliable conclusions can be reached for the Sicilian population as a whole from such a narrow sample.  Dr. Ornella Semino, a former colleage of mine, found it both amusing and a bit disturbing when I mentioned to here that certain non-professional forum posters considered her study """"outdated"""" or """"overruled"""" or """"refuted""""  all absolute drivel!

Lastly, the person who wrote this...

"""The person who said that it was hit by a missile was the brother of someone on the airplane. Clearly he is going to be emotional and not a worthwhile source.

Speedy deletion of Dustin Garringer
 A tag has been placed on Dustin Garringer requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

I have restored the OR tag. It was removed by HighKing without any discussion and he then had the gall to remove it again following a restore and to claim BRD in doing so. The fact that it was put in place by a user who is now known to be a sock is totally irrelevant, but the main reason for putting it back is that this article is total, 100% OR. There is no comparable treatment of this """"dispute"""" anywhere else. All we've got are a few people, groups and organisations who sometimes complain about the term and don't use it. We have no demonstrations in the streets about it, no campaign groups exist, You don't see posters anywhere denouncing the term. There is just nothing, other than some random opinions. This whole article is a complete fabrication. It could almost be regarded as a hoax article. It is here simply to promote anti-British Isles POV.

I care not about the mess.  Thanks.  I have a few images up, more coming but I have to get back on the road!  By the way, I saw a source that said that the 1968 AFL championship was to be played at the East Division Champ.  Alternating divisions.  The NFL did something similar for many years.  
I had a bit of a laugh out of this (snatched it off a 1962 ticket order form).  Ample restrooms?  I guess they were counting the ramps.  
Ha!   Talk 
I put a mention of ample restrooms in the image caption in the History article, and Jets fans should get a good laugh.  Images are up, I stopped because I did not want to crowd the article.  I'll keep uploading later.  I will substitute in the Namath shot, unless you have a better idea (from the four page newsletter, Jet Stream they used to send to season ticket holders, I think they did so into my tenure as a season ticket holder (since 1986).  
You have built up a very impressive collection and the article looks great! The images will help make it easier on the eyes for sure. The Namath shot is fine besides, he was an important part of the team's success and should be depicted. Some brief thoughts: After this season we'll have to re-visit the article and, in all liklihood, split it at the 90s, I would say. I'm still determined to capture the elusive photo of Rex in his element as I return to Foxboro in October, here's hoping my camera will function properly so we could add that to the article. We may also be able to grab something from the Commons for Sanchez if I can't capture him either.   Talk 
I was thinking about a split at 1969, right after the blockquote I just added.  The AFL material is more detailed.  Next time I go to a day game I'll bring my camera.  Maybe even a night.  
That's a good idea actually. Makes the most sense.   Talk

You should know that after checking the references again I discerned that you are abolutely correct.  Indeed, it is not Blackshire Belay that Baugh posits as his source for Afrocentic view number (ii).  Based on the footnote number 8 that appears after the first phrase in numder (ii), i.e., “refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole;[8]” Baugh actually attributes this view to; Williams (1975) and Williams (1997).   This prompts the question; is the second phrase that appears to be a continuation of number (ii) which states; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English: either” also included as what Dr.Williams posits?  For if it is attributed to Dr. Williams, I still say it is not Afrocentric and to posit this phrase as an Afrocentric view is in fact an outright misrepresentation of what Dr. Williams has stated.

"MSU Interview 

Dear Feezo,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar",0

 Irrelevant 

I have seen, already too many times, people removing some other's comments as being irrelevant. They are not removed for being vandalism or the like. I don't understand that practice, I don't even like it. If someone considers it irrelevant just say so in a comment to the comment instead of just removing it. Let the others judge by themselves if it is irrelevant or not. After all, this is the talk page, not the article. It is really tedious to have to go to the history to see if what was removed is irrelevant or not. If it were vandalism or maybe even just tagged as such I wouldn't bother, but """"irrelevant"""".

"Memories of Senator Sam Ervin 

In my late teens, prior to joining the Navy, I had ambitions that exceeded my financial means. I wanted to be a lawyer. 
Fate would provide a different path in my life, but in those days I used to go to the courthouse in Morganton, NC when I had a chancejust to watch the lawyers argue cases. I dreamed about someday being able to present cases like many of them did.
Once in a while, the presiding Judge would stop everything and recognize Senator Ervin, who would show up in the court to watch the proceedings. Once recognized, the Senator would usually stand up and give some folksy, always humorous, anecdotal speech that made everyone smile-even the guilty. Of course, this was usually in traffic or small claims court. 
A lifelong Republican, I have to admit that I retain a great admiration for the intelligence, wit, and the man the Senator Ervin (a Democrat) was.

"Hi again Antandrus.  I agree with your point two, of course - I mean that sincerely.  My problem is that I've been editing anonymously for a while, I really don't know how long, and time was that I didn't have any problems with people randomly and arbitrarily undoing my work.  At some point this began to happen.  It is incredibly offensive.  In fact, to me, it is much more offensive than if someone called me a cunt.  The first time, I assumed it was an isolated incident, but then it happened again... and again... and again.  At least 10 times, and perhaps 20 times or more, my edits have been reverted, often with no explanation, and sometimes with accusations of vandalism.  It's been many months since the first time.  And whether you take a polite tone, or you just mouth off at everyone, the end result is exactly the same.  I have seen probably three or maybe four editors, yourself included, who have taken what I thought was the obvious view that you shouldn't arbitrarily revert IP edits, and I have seen at least ten times as many editors who revert arbitrarily, and plenty who invent post-hoc justifications for their actions.
These arbitrary reverts are a real slap in the face.  I get more satisfaction out of responding viciously than I would out of responding politely, and the end result is exactly the same.  It's very, very depressing to see how reasonable, sensible people like yourself became the minority.  Believe me, if you were the majority, I would not be viciously slagging off anyone.
My IP will change at some point, I don't force it to but it does.  I have no respect for the blocks that result from me being accused of vandalism, so I ignore them.  And I keep on trying to improve articles, and eventually, the same will happen.  So be it.  190.45.54.212",0

Aside from being an oddly specific notability requirement, being on the NYT bestseller list the longest doesn't erase the fact that her work has nothing to do with Filipino-Americans. She complains about being the target of racism, but actively criticizes Asian-Americans to the point that she herself has been called racist. She is relevant in an article on conservatism perhaps.

 Anti-TKD slant 

I noticed that the article was changed to reflect a pro-foreign-influence slant.  I will eventually attempt to make appropriate edits in increments... edits made.  Comments welcome:  1. Introduction stated that TKD is an amalgamation of Chinese, Japan and Korean art.  While this may be factually true, it's a misleading introduction to TKD as many martial arts, including all forms of Karate, are amalgamations.  It serves no good purpose, other than NPOV agenda, to highlight this as an introduction to TKD.  2. Under """"development of TKD"""", controversies surrounding Karate's influence on TKD was overstated once again.  This topic is dealt with quite accurately in the Karate article.  It makes sense to follow that lead in this case.  It's misleading and NPOV the way it is written now.  3. Under """"traditional roots"""" TKD's foreign influence is again overstated.  Whoever, made these edits obviously had a pro-karate agenda.  The topic of foreign influence can be delt with in a fair and objective manner without being beaten to death under every subsection!  4. Under """"External Influence"""" foreign influence should be appropriately dealt with. 

The article is now overstating Taekwondo's relationship with Subak/Taekkyon; do we really need several long paragraphs all about """"Subak"""" (手搏) (whatever that was) and the Hwarang (whoever they really were) and Taekkyon supposedly slowly developing into Taekwondo over hundreds of years?  Taekkyon still exists today, so we can talk about Taekkyon's development in that article separately (noting that Taekkyon looks completely different from modern Taekwondo).  Japan's influences on Taekwondo are also well-documented, so why remove it?  Let's keep a neutral point of view for this article.  At this point, it sounds like the first few pages of a Taekwondo student's guide.

I think this needs to be looked into more carefully but history of Korean martial arts is a very relevant part of tkd.  Let's leave the text as is until we can sort this out.  I also have to say that your dismissive attitude isn't very POV.  Instead of blindly defending or rejecting labels, we need to deconstruct ideas and arguments and go through them with a fine comb.  Regardless of what you want to call it, Koreans have been kicking in fights and contests for thousands of years and documentation for this exists as far back as the three kingdoms era.  Chosun documentation also exists that show that Subak was part of the formal requirements for entrance into Chosun military and large Taekyon tournaments held by the populace well into the 1800's.  Most of Korean folk arts and traditional Korean disciplines existed and even thrived during the Chosun dynasty without formalization or systemization(e.g. korean wrestling called ssirum, pan sori, musical instruments, minstrels, etc.).  But the absence of formal schools, teachers and formal links doesn't mean that those arts weren't passed down or that they didn't exist.    While tkd isn't taekyon, tkd is a product of Korean attempts at formalizing a Korean martial art.  In an objective inquiry into TKD's origins, you need to understand the history and culture of Korean martial arts, culture and history.  To leave this out would be erroneously simplistic.  The martial arts aspect of Korean culture(folk culture during Chosun times) provides the basis for the formalization and systemization that Korean martial arts goes through in the 1900's.  TKD claims this, history and culture of Korean arts and disciplines provides the background for this, and the actual practice of tkd bears this out.  To ignore all this and look only for and only accept formal links between masters, students, formal schools, etc., is NPOV and more importantly wouldn't reflective objective reality behind TKD's conception.

btw.  There's a lot of crap out there about a lot of Korean martial arts but Hwarang are mentioned in Korean historical documents, Subak is mentioned countless times in military, historical records including Chosun records.  Taekyon was a part of Subak and its popularity was well documented by during Chosun times in its mention of Taekyon tournaments that were held well into the 1800's.   

To keep this (relatively) short, just a few points:

1. We know that """"Subak"""" has been mentioned in the Mooyedobotongji and other sources, but we don't really know exactly what """"Subak"""" actually referred to.  In China, the same word (pronounced """"Shoubo"""") was used as a general term for barehand martial arts, however - thus, it is likely that Koreans used the same word in the same way (as it was a loanword).
2. Hwarang are of course mentioned in many Korean texts, but we don't actually know",0

 Trivia, last time 

See this edit, in which , who edits little else besides this article, this section, claims that there is consensus on this talk page for this horrible selection of trivia. The trivia here is nothing but insignificant mentions and some other tripe, including an originally-researched claim that it's """"close"""" to some location in a 19th-century novel, just to indicate the level of encyclopedic discourse, and what can only be described as a combination of trivia and spam in the link to the SCP Foundation Web Site, whatever it is.

We seem to have a few issues under discussion at the same time here, and I think it would be helpful to separate them.   

Maintaining """"old"""" FAs
As  said (00:14, 11 December 2008), this article was promoted to FA in 2006, when standards were less demanding, so work is needing to keep it close to current FA standard.

Unfortunately the """"committee"""" process advocated by  doesn't work if the """"committee"""" is slow to respond. In Oct 2006 I pointed out some serious scientific errors in Dinosaur, another """"old"""" FA; nothing happened so in Jan 2007 I gave notice of my intention to fix these points; a few days later, after nobody objected, I fixed them; and a few days later the corrections were reverted, so that the article again contained the errors I'd pointed out 3 months earlier.    

Quality of images
This one has the potential to run for a long time. I have no strong objections to the image per se, but I'm not sure the article needs a reconstruction of a juvenile T rex'.   

Selection of images
Wikipedia is not a picture gallery, and images need to be used selectively. IMO if we have have plenty of images, as we appear to for dinosaurs, we  should use those that illustrate the content rather than just providing eye-candy. In many cases diagrams should take priority over pure pictures.   

Size and placement of images
There has been recent disussion of this at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Forcing Lead image (plus a more general Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style item that's now archived and I can't find it) and at Wikipedia talk:Accessibility#Image position. To sum up my own views:
Images that illustrate specific content should be alongside that content.
Layout of pages that use images has become more difficult as widescreen monitors have become more prevalent, as increasing the text width reduces the height of paragraphs, sections, etc.
I dislike left-floating images, as this makes the text less readable by changing the postion of the start of the next line, so that users have to search for it rather than jump to a familiar X co-ordinate.
The functions of images vary. Sometimes they convey a lot of detailed info, and a larger size than the default is needed. On other occasions they need give only a general impression of what something looks like, and a smaller size than the default is adequate. The majority of readers are unregistered and therefore cannot set preferences for image size or anything else. Hence editors have to pick image sizes that are appropriate for the purpose.
Accessibility to users with poor vision (but not functionally blind) is irrelevant, as they will either have their browsers set permanently on """"zoom in"""" or have software that zooms in for all apps.
 makes ugly gaps in the text and reduces the readability of articles.
IMO all these points indicate that MOS cannot dictate a """"one size fits all"""" solution and editors should be free to set image sizes.   """,0

"""::::: """"Indisputable""""? I'm sorry but WP does not recognize your or any editor as having the power to declare a matter under dispute as """"indisputable."""" I'm disputing it, based on considerable experience with PCs sold as complete PCs. I'm talking in particular about the models that are installed on the high tens of millions of corporate desktops in the US alone. PS/2 ports are like hen's teeth in that environment and these machines vastly outsell motherboards sold as components or high-end PCs sold to gamers. 

 Re. consensus, it is most decidedly not a """"numbers game."""" WP:CONSENSUS is not based on voting, but on logical arguments: 
Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy.

 See also WP:NOTDEMOCRACY: 

Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy or any other political system. Its primary (though not exclusive) means of decision making and conflict resolution is editing and discussion leading to consensus—not voting.

 And as for consensus vs. policies, see again WP:CONSENSUS:

Consensus among a limited group of editors, at one place and time, cannot override community consensus on a wider scale. For instance, unless they can convince the broader community that such action is right, participants in a WikiProject cannot decide that some generally accepted policy or guideline does not apply to articles within its scope.

 In short: Nobody has presented a RS for your claim, so it doesn't matter how many people agree with you. So far your argument has consisted of a survey of specialty products from one online vendor, followed by numerous instances of """"argument by vigorous assertion."""" WP:RS requires more than that.

Re Bukharan Jews the only Jews having """"Issachar"""" as a surname. Lived in area """"thousands"""" of years. Example of the naivete and narrow scholarship of the article. First, the Bukharan Jews were almost entirely bereft of Jewish knowledge and practice by the 19th century, when they were missionized and """"restored"""" by foreign Jewish emissaries. They had virtually no traditions. No one assumes a high level of culture in this remote area """"thousands"""" of years ago. East-West trade began well into the Common Era, and Persian Jews in the silk-route trade probably established a trading colony here, as they did in Sinkiang/Kansu and Kaifeng (which were also defunct or highly assimilated by the early 19C). Secondly: """"Issachar"""" is a very common surname or surname root among other Jews. It is so common, that it is one of the very few tribal names that has a nickname, usually """"sheik"""" or a cognate form: eg Sheikowitz, Sikorski, Shack, etc..

18-ethoxycoronaridine
Hi Edgar. Could you take a look at this page? It seems a little suspicious to me...no references and the only google hits to the 18-ethoxycoronaridine are to the wiki page and the website of the abovementioned Obiter Research (some other ethoxy coronaridine derivatives are found as natural products, but not the 18-). I'm thinking if the University of Vermont had licensed out one of their patented compounds for the development of a new drug addiction treatment medication (the patents on 18-methoxycoronaridine are rather broad so this probably is covered) then they would have made some kind of press release about it?   
The compound doesn't show up in SciFinder, but it's not too surprising that nothing has been published yet if it was first synthesized in 2010.  It's quite possible that little is known about it, and it would be too early to be considered a drug addiction treatment, and not yet something to put out a press release about.  So the content of the article doesn't come across as inaccurate to me, but it probably doesn't meet Wikipedia's guidelines pertaining to notability and verifiability.  My guess is that someone involved in the research created the article in a moment of vanity.  It might be best to merge the article into another which already has content about various coronaridine derivatives, such as 18-Methoxycoronaridine.  This would at least put it in context.    (Edgar181) 
Hmm fair points, I was thinking about just asking the page creator for the relevant patent number so the page at least has a reference. But now that I had a better look I'm still more suspicious about the company, they look like they are just doing a custom synthesis of an obscure material that people might want and trying to sell it for a high price (18-methoxycoronaridine is not readily available from biosciences suppliers like Tocris or Sigma-Aldrich so researchers would probably be interested in a close analogue). And if things like this are anything to go by I feel the page may be more about marketing their poor quality product (they even admit it is racemic on their webshop) than proclaiming their new research. I'd be tempted to email the University of Vermont (or maybe just Dr Glick personally as no doubt he would know) about whether any licensing agreement exists as claimed.   
Ok the relevant patent is US 6211360 issued to Stanley D Glick and Martin E Kuehne and the University of Vermont in 2001, but the patent filing was in 1996. So the 18-ethoxy compound is covered by the patent but it isn't one of the examples or preferred compounds",0

 Ettlinger Being Jewish + His Family 

Hi all,

I learned about Adrian’s death after a web search yielded this Wikipedia article (see my post of """"In Memoriam"""" about him to the Freecell Solving Discussions mailing list), and since he was a good Internet friend of mine, and we corresponded extensively on E-mail, I’d like to help with the English Wikipedia article about him. In any case, Ettlinger told me in a private E-mail that he was Jewish (at least by descent - he wasn’t an observant/religious Jew and said something about being a deist), and so I think his article should be added to the American Jews by occupation category. One problem I see there is that I don't see any sub-category for Jewish American Engineers and/or Jewish American software developers (he was both). I know that Richard Stallman is a Jewish (also only by decent) American software developer, and he belongs to the categories """"American computer programmers"""" and """"American Jews"""" and there are naturally many others. I have kept most of the E-mails with him, so can upload them in part to my web-site or elsewhere for citation, nut will it be considered a self-reference? So what should be done?

Adrian also told me about his family (two children if I remember correctly, and four or five grandchildren, all but one are attending university now), but I don't think he mentioned any names. Should they be mentioned as well?

I'll try to improve the entry about him in other respects. Thanks to all the Wikipedia editors who wrote what exists up to now based on the research.

"""IN RESPONSE TO THE GENETICS OF KURDS AND JEWS==

I would like to point something out. There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the """"Children of Queen Ester."""" Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister. 

The genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans. 

Mind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic. Semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people, while many European Jews are fair and resemble the native European population. I hope you follow.

Genetically and hereditarily the closes people to the Kurds are the Lur and   Bakhtari, which are both Iranian peoples, followed by the Persians. 

The article that is basically claiming that Kurds are closer to Jewish populations than Iranians is incoherent and should be deleted because it is taken out of context and is from a non-primary and constricted source that has been widely disagreed with by the scientific community.

Request
Can someone do clean up the Philosophical and artistic gestures? It's really long-winded. 

It's a painting of a pipe. I call it abstract surrealism. Since surrealism was based off of freud, along with the conscious interpreation of visual perception, i call it surreal.  

Here we go again about the """"abstract"""" versus the """"representational"""" branches of surrealism!  SURREALISM IS AN ARTISTIC MOVEMENT! so one should not analyse it only in terms of painting.  Miró was not an abstract painter.  He vehemently denied this and detested """"abstract painting.""""  

I disagree. Wikipedia currently defines an art movement as """"a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time"""", which surrealism clearly is, the tendency being towards weirdness. User2.0

I think that it is fairly undeniable that Surrealism was a movement (cf. the manifestos of Breton, the internal wrangling, etc.).  One may be able to interpret it is a non-artistic movement, especially considering its revolutionary politics, but I think that given the program laid out by Breton himself, surrealism is best understood as an artistic movement.  Of course, to describe it as simply the tendency """"towards weirdness"""" is to miss most (if not all) of what Surrealism (and certainly Magritte's work) was about (although I am certainly not accusing to previous poster of actually subscribing to such a view!).  07:24, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)

 Title Beneath 

""""The title of the painting is written beneath it, seemingly a contradiction, but meaning that the image of the pipe is not itself a pipe."""" As far as I know (limited indeed), 'Ceci n'est pas une pipe' is written below it, not 'The Betrayal of Images', which is the generally accepted title of the work.

 Treachery/Betrayal of Images 

Before my edit, the article contained two references to the translation of La trahison des images as The Betrayal of Images and one to The Treachery of Images. I changed the former to conform to the latter. My reasoning (besides the fact that I've always heard of this particular painting referred to as The Treachery... and never The Betrayal...) is that although the French trahison can mean either """"betrayal"""" or """"treachery,"""" the two English words have very distinct meanings  a betrayal is a treacherous action, and """"betrayal"""" without the indefinite article refers to specific treacherous acts being committed, whereas """"treachery"""" is the character trait of being prone to committing such acts  and Magritte seems to clearly mean that images can be deceptive by their nature, not that images are collectively committing a single act of betrayal. So The Treachery of Images seems to me to be the better translation.  

 The Young Gaze Scents the Festivity of the Old Tree

"Shocked - Maghie 

Hi,

I would have preferred to have sent this to you as a private e-mail - but it seems you do accept e-mails. So, I have to ignore my need to be well mannered and respond to you publicly.

I must say that I am rather disappointed that an editor with your expertise would be so rude to a newcomer - totally disregarding the Wikipedia rules of 'Do not Bite the newcomer'. No one likes spammers including me - but surely you should check out your facts before accusing people. And you should also give them the chance to read their first mail and figure out how to navigate this system before threatening them.

I was not trying to promote my site or increase my rankings. I was trying to share information learned from years of real life observation on a topic that is not well known on many species of birds that wikipedia has very scanty information about. (information I myself was desperately searching for before I commenced my research.) I apologise for my error. I have deleted the remaining links and will leave the hole in the wikipedia information untouched. (I did not notice all the other external links being discussed in the article talk pages. It would also be a huge time consuming exercise for the editors and myselfto do that for nearly 36 species and more on an on-going basis.)

It seems Wikipedia has still a long way to go in making genuine contributors welcome. I hope other users are treated with more politeness and consideration in the future.

Kind regards, Maghie (talk)  Maghie

 It seems to me that your only contributions to date are to add external links to your website from various bird pages; see WP:EL which is about the adding external links.

"Carcass Wikipedia 

Hello,

I hope you are well. My name is Bill and I play guitar in a band called Carcass. It appears you have taken it upon yourself to edit our Wikipedia page, even going so far as to undo any recent attempts on our part to correct the numerous mistakes that are present. Now, while we do appreciate that there may be good intentions at work, the bottom line is that someone we have never even met has decided that they know more about our band's history than we do. And that is annoying, to put it mildly.

If all of this was done from a fan's perspective and a genuine (if misguided) desire to set the record straight, I must thank you for your efforts. In many ways I can relate to that position as I still consider myself a fan of music first, a musician second. But I also know I wouldn't ever have the nerve to try and govern any of my favourite bands' Wikipedia pages.

Given that this is the insane world of the internet, I won't make the rash assumption that you are actually an admirer of our band. This wouldn't be the first time that someone who dislikes us has chosen to spread misinformation online. But in the (perhaps unlikely) event that you are interested and prepared to listen, let me know and I will explain which details are wrong, and why. There are quite a few and in all honesty I don't want to waste my time going through all of this unless you are genuinely concerned.

You know I am ready, willing and able to defend my contributions. That's why I get upset when reverts are done that avoids discussion that allows people to defend their contributions. Treating me like some kid vandalizing articles is insulting to say the least. I am sure that the idea of reverts and other processed was not ment as a means to censor information since Wiki does have a policy against censorship.

"""

Also, everything you linked to Dennis Brown, was quite obviously meant as humor. """"ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES. Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!"""" 

Don't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing.

Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.

Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR."""" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me """"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them."""" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.   Kingshowman""",1

I know a load of administrators must be watching this page, so I am going to tell you all this right here:

TABThe recent antics (Nanook Vandalism etc.) preformed by this anonymous user (216.164.203.90) were preformed on purpose, as a part of an experiment.  I am currently writing to you from my place of work, located in Boston, Mass, USA.  I have chosen to perform this unorthodox experiment from my workplace, in order to avoid negative votes on my possible upcoming election as an administrator, on the Wikipedia username I use from home.  The main purpose of this experiment was to know, first hand, what vandalism “feels like,” from the vandals’ point of view.  Let me tell you, “I have learned a lot” 
TABI appreciate how you all quickly reverted vandalism and left welcoming warning messages in the beginning.  When I continued to vandalize “Wolf” I appreciated how you all “Assumed Good Faith.”  However, Kim van der Linde, at times you forgot to stay “As cool as a cucumber.”  I especially admired Radio Kirk’s reaction and cool persistence with the block he initiated.  His direct quoting of the complaints of others was a smart move.  I also liked how you all continually to welcome me to Wikipedia even though I was annoying the ^&%$ out of you.  
TABSo, to recap, the recent problems caused by than account were done on purpose, as an experiment by me, in order to find better ways of combating vandalism with my other Wikipedia account.  I thank you all for you response and for now I’m signing out.  If anyone else uses the ip to access Wikipedia in the future, please regard them as a new user, as I don’t plan on using my work computer to access Wikipedia in the future.  Thank you all and have a great day!

 outline articles 

I read your posts about outlines on AnnaFrance's talk page and decided to call the military history project for help in establishing guidance and providing review processes where editors can get outside opinion. The thread can be found here. Greetings   

Historical outlines
Regarding Category:Historical outlines...

I still strongly believe those """"Historical outline of foo"""" articles should actually be named """"Timeline of foo"""". More accurate and precise, and perhaps comprehensible. (I mentioned it before somewhere, but can't find it now).

For an example, compare Outline of Illinois history with Timeline of Chicago history.

Maybe we need to upgrade List of timelines to be a part of the Portal:Contents/ set?

Just a note, for you to consider, whilst you're mass-moving things around... )    

 Based on the way the history section of outlines have been developed (especially the history sections of country outlines), the major classification scheme seems to be:

 By period
 By region
 By subject

 Which makes these articles general outlines, rather than timelines.  The """"By period"""" section may be a timeline, if it is formatted that way.

 As far as I can tell, the """"historical outline of"""" articles by Buaidh aren't chronological, but topical, which makes them generic outlines rather than outlines of the timeline variety.

 The 2014 Inquest 

NB This was originally posted, by a different editor, under Talk:Hillsborough disaster#Missing from this article? but I'm moving it to its own section so it doesn't get lost. 2.25.115.116  

Currently the article does not convey the fact that a new Inquest into the Hillsboroguh Fans' deaths has begun. 

Changes to the article are likely to be actually controversial or be seen to be controversial for the next year or so, regardless of source. New facts may emerge into the public domain as a alarge amount of documentation has been made available to the Coroner. 

For this reason, Wikipedia Editors might be best seeking to lock editing for the duration and to seek expertise regarding how to edit without interfering with the Inquest.   — Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.40.44.174   

The above is probably one of many reasons why this article should be locked for editing, given the topic immediately above this one. This article has already been raised at WP:AN. Lets defer to the admins common sense and judgement for the time being  (attempt) 

Articles relating to high-profile court cases are not normally protected - see WP:PROTECT for policy. This is partly because this a private website based in the USA; the US and UK rules on freedom of speech during court cases are rather different and Wikipedia - like other organisations - doesn't take kindly to people outside the US trying to apply their rules to it.    Also, there are plenty of Wikipedia editors who are quick to remove material they see as inappropriate and 185 editors have this article on their watchlist. This can work very well - see above for how quickly the offensive material was removed from this article - so I expect the default will be to carry on as normal unless problems arise. If they do, there's a whole range of measures that include blocking particular editors from Wikipedia or barring brand new or unregistered editors.

QUESTION. Was this match an all ticket affair ? If so, how many of the 96 had tickets ?? If they did have tickets - were they purchased from reputable retailers ???

I do not dispute that Jack Dyer is credited with inventing the drop punt. Hugh Hinks invented the Drop Punt in 1907. Page 342 & 347 ì In The Beginning There Was Carisbrookî by Daryl McLeish, 2001.
 TABTAB
Despite claims to the contrary Carlton believed  that Horrie Clover invented the drop punt. Teammate Newton Chandler believed that Clover first saw the kick used by a teammate at Carisbrook and that he perfected it from there. 6th Edition The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers.
 TABTAB
Len Metherell, who made his debut in 1930, see 6th Edition The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers, certainly used the drop punt, and indicated that he had learned it from his father. With the retirement of Dyer in 1949 the drop punt gradually fell into disuse. When Bartle, of Geelong, took a spectacular mark five meters from goal in 1958 and kicked a behind, the Geelong advertiser admonishes: he foolishly tried a drop punt. 3AW Book of Footy Records 1989 page195/6 
 TABTAB
Interestingly Jack Dyer commenced with Richmond in 1931 and would have played against Clover and Metherell. 
 TABTAB
Next recorded  use was by the Collier Brothers see Page 195 3AW Book of Footy Records. 
 TABTAB
Next recorded use was by Jack Dyer. The Sporting Globe FOOTBALL Book 1948.
 TABTAB
Page 49: Jack Dyer gets goals with the sillies looking kick in football history.
 TABTAB
Jack Dyer adapted the Collier Brothers of Collingwood’s Drop Punt, which they used as a short pass of around ten yards in place of a hand pass. They only used it to pass the ball to each other over the head of an opponent. See page 165, Jack Dyer Captain Blood as told to Brian Hanson, Paul, (London), 1965. 
 TABTAB
Interesting note. 
 TABTAB
The drop punt had a slow take-up by teams: Dyer himself attributed this to

Coaches do no teach this kick to their players for one reason. They cannot do it and have never bothered to learn its fundamentals Football Clinic, p.167 Captain Blood, Jack Dyer. As told to Brian Hansen, Paul, (London), 1965.

 Problem in gallery and request for this article to be moved 

A lot of people in the image gallery are represented as Tajiks while this is not true. Ferodwsi was born in Iran, therefore he could not have been Tajik. Secondly Rabia Balkhi was of Arab descent therefore she could not have been of Tajik descent either. Lastly, why is Muhammad of Ghori included in the gallery of Tajiks? He was not Taik, the ghorids themselves were believed to be Pashtuns and they were NOT native speakers of the Persian language rather patronizers of the culture. There seems to be a lot of vandalism and propaganda being posted by Tajiks here themselves, with no evidence being provided.

Why should her name be kept secret? People should know who that girl was. Revealing her name will be true respect to her. This was the same thing her father said too and you think that by hiding her name you are respecting her. No you are doing the total opposite.Not only that her name is completely verifable. Wikipedia is not a place for personal opinion but still revealing her name will inspire people. People made a publicity of her death and you say I'm the one disrespecting her.

Tell me can you say to a political leader who is using her name for political agenda. Of course not because he's way more powerful than you. It's easier to blame the weak and tell them.they're doing the right thing but we can.never do that to those more powerful than us. Think again before saying that I don't respect her.

 Celine Dion Signings 

Please do not change Celine's signings in the infobox. The infobox should only pertain to signings and not imprints traced to the artist around the world. The reason why Celine was imprinted with Columbia and not Epic in Europe and Canada is because her catalog is actually sold by her original signee, Sony Music Canada, who uses the Columbia label. The content creator on the other hand is pic records up till 2007, and 2007 onward Columbia Records. Columbia Records as a standalone company exists in two places: NYC (original standalone company for many decades) and London (a division of Sony Music UK). Every other """"Sony Music (insert country name here)"""" company uses it as an A&R; imprint, they don't operate actual companies or standalone divisions called Columbia. Celine's first sony affiliate signing was in 1986 to CBS Records Canada, (CBS became Sony globally on jan 1, 1991), and Sony Music Canada used the Columbia logo on her (worked with the """"columbia"""" a&r; team at Sony Canada). Then Celine went on to sign with Sony affiliates in the US, but in the US they operate as standalone companies since there's many of them (there's just not one central """"sony music"""" company). However, even though she signed other sony deals in another country, her original signee (sony music canada) is still the worldwide sales agent of her work, and hence passed along their """"columbia"""" item to europe sony affiliates. Notice in the infobox it indicates she is still on sony music canada, because for as long as she's involved with sony in the US, she is still tied to sony canada. Furthermore, even without this explanation, it is irrelevant what label is used in other markets where the artist isn't signed for the infobox. For example, in Japan, Sony does NOT have the rights to the Columbia trademark, hence every single Sony artist ever, whether Columbia or any other label, was released there with the Epic imprint instead by Sony Music Japan. Does that mean we go to every sony related artist and insert Epic?? Indeed not. """,0

Here is the explanation of the legal side of Capital Maintenance as quoted directly from

""""The Capital Maintenance Concept and Share Repurchases in South African Law - By F.H.I Cassim and Rehana Cassim

The Capital maintenance concept 
 
The South African Companies Act 61 of 1973 adopts a strange and a curios ambivalence towards the nineteenth-century common law concept of the maintenance of the share capital of a company. In some respects, the Companies Act still clings to this archaic and outdated concept, while in other respects, it boldly sweeps away the concept and replaces it with the more modern twins tests of “liquidity” and “solvency” as a form of creditor protection.

According to the capital maintenance concept, the issued share capital of a company is seen as a guarantee fund or a permanent fund intended for the payment of the claims of the creditors of a company, with the result that the issued share capital of a company may not be reduced, nor may it be returned to shareholders except where the Companies Act or the common law authorizes it. Thus, Lord Halsbury, L.C., in The Ooregum Gold Mining Company of India Ltd v Roper,[1] declared that “[t]he capital is fixed and certain, and every creditor of the company is entitled to look to that capital as his security”. This was echoed some eight decades later in Cohen NO v Segal,[2] where the court, in prohibiting the payment of a dividend out of share capital, proclaimed that
 
“[w]hatever has been paid by a member cannot be returned to him and no part of the corpus of the company can be returned to a member so as to take away from the fund to which the creditors have a right to look as that out of which they are to be paid. The capital may be spent or lost in carrying on the business of the company, but it cannot be reduced except in the manner and with the safeguards provided by the statute.”
 
In accordance with this concept, ss.81 and 82 of the Companies Act prohibit a company from issuing its shares at a discount unless certain stringent precautions have been complied with. Section 79 prohibits a company from paying interest on shares out of share capital unless this is authorised by the articles of association of the company or by a special resolution, the interest paid is restricted to a maximum of six per cent per annum, and the approval of the Minister of Industries, Commerce and Tourism has been obtained.
 
F.H.I Cassim LL.B. (cum laude), LL.M (um laude) (University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; Advocate of the High Court of South Africa; Associate Professor of Law, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, Consultant with Bowman Gilfillan Inc.
 
Rehana Cassim BA (cum laude), LL.B. (cum laude) (University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa); Bowman Gilfillan Inc.

These statutory provisions find their roots in the capital maintenance concept, but it no longer makes any sense to preserve them in their present form, because instead of complying with the burdensome requirements of s.79, a company may now simply make a “payment” including dividend payments in terms of s.90 (as amended in 1999), whether out of capital or profits, to its shareholders provided that this is authorised by its articles of association and that it satisfies the tests of “liquidity” and “solvency” (as explained below). A company may, if it so desires, prohibit in its articles of association such “payments”. Section 90 abandons the common law concept of capital maintenance and together with it the fundamental common law principle that dividends may only be paid out of distributable profits. Unlike English law, ss.83 and 84 which regulated reductions of share capital have been repealed by s.8 of the Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1999, with the result that there is no longer any statutory procedure for the reduction of a company’s share capital, expect in accordance with s90 of the Companies Act. Perhaps this conflict in the underlying philosophy and policy of the South African Companies Act is a direct result of the patchwork and piecemeal reform that has taken place in South African corporate law during the 30-year existence of the Companies Act of 1973. By way of contrast, ss.135-141 of the UK Companies Act 1985 have preserved the statutory procedures and regulations relating to reductions of share capital.
 
Share repurchases 

Another vital aspect of the reform of the capital maintenance concept is the right conferred by s.85 of the Companies Act (as amended by s.9 of the Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1999) to enable companies to purchase their own shares. Until 1999, South African corporate law was one of the few remaining common law jurisdictions which continued to pr",0

I strongly contest the use of this """"evidence"""" that Langan is an advocate of intelligent design, for the following reasons:
Firstly, and most importantly, it is not about Langan. It is about someone else entirely.
Dembski is clearly a partisan commentator. Guettarda argues that if the pro-ID Dembski and the anti-ID editors of this entry both thinks someone is an ID advocate, then he is. This is a false conclusion. The fact that Dembski writes """"As a fellow of the ISCID, such and such is a card-carrying member of the ID movement,"""" does not make it correct to infer that ISCID fellowship equals ID advocate. Dembski is involved in a pro-ID political campaign, so no doubt wants to claim people as pro-ID.
Even Dembski is not cited here claiming Langan is pro-ID. So it is not true to say that """"both sides"""" agree that Langan is pro-ID
The fact that an anti-Langan editor is forced to resort to this kind of """"evidence"""" is itself a further indication of how little actual evidence there is that Langan is an advocate of ID.  
Not one citation has been provided from a secondary source stating that Langan is an advocate of ID.
Not one citation has been provided from Langan stating that he is an advocate of ID.
Substantial evidence and argument has been provided that Langan is not an advocate of ID, and that anti-Langan editors have persistently misunderstood the nature of Langan's position. None of this evidence and argument has been refuted, or even discussed, by anti-Langan editors.
And I note as well the continuing trend of anti-Langan editors to edit the entry, then make a comment on the talk page for possible discussion, rather than discussing the matter and seeing if there is agreement. That is if they leave a comment at all. This is clearly poor form in an entry that is obviously contested and controversial. Some people have been blocked for less.  """,0

I also had a chance to discuss the airplane with Tony LeVier at the IPMS convention in Miami during 1968. The aircraft was underpowered according to him. I realize this personal knowledge is classified as 'original research' (and indeed I did explore the airplane) so I have not bothered to post this on the page.

"RAF and Commonwealth pilots all wore seat-type parachutes which fitted into the standard pilot's bucket seat, whilst the other crew members all wore chest-fitted removable parachutes. The parachute pack clipped-on to the harness at the front (chest) and only needed to be attached immediately before jumping. For confined rear turrets the pack was sometimes stored outside the turret in the fuselage, the gunner only needing to reach behind him to open the two rear doors of the turret and reach into the fuselage. Where the tail gunner stowed his parachute depended on personal preference and to some extent, on his physical size.

The internal dimensions of the Lancaster and its turrets was somewhat wanting in terms of space, as when the basic aircraft had been designed (as the Manchester) the normal flying clothing was limited to perhaps a Sidcot suit and a parachute. With the increasing later use of such apparel as Irvin jackets and Mae Wests and other impedimenta the average crew member became a much bulkier figure, leading to difficulties in exiting the aircraft in an emergency, the dimensions of the escape hatches remaining unchanged. This possibly accounts for the higher crew losses for the Lancaster compared to the Halifax, which was also much roomier inside.",0

""":::Mike Brown clearly knows that he can't get away with naming a planet (-like thing) after a character from popular culture, which is the main status of Eris the Discordian goddessfrom her appearance in The Illuminati Trilogy.  So the fact that he only points to the Greek origin of the namei.e., the origin that would be seen as legitimate by the IAUis not particularly strong evidence that he didn't have any other origin in mind when he suggested the term.  That Brown would change the name of the moon from Gabrielle to Dysnomia does indicated a somewhat playful nature.

On the other hand, if you were to ask a randomly selected representative of nerd culture who """"Eris"""" was, I think you'd find a lot more people referencing The Illumninati Trilogy than the Trojan War.  This is not to do a mind-reading act and say that we know something about Brown's intentions that he's never mentioned, but to suggest that the Discordian connection is a significant association that deserves a few words in the name section.

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” 

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the right to change their religious affiliation. 

Abou-Mekhael told Compass today that the church remains officially sealed, and that he is in the process of filing a case against the attackers. He also said that his congregation of approximately 80 people is ready to open a second case if they are denied their constitutional right to worship at the site. 

“Even if we get permission to remove the red wax, there are still threats from the mayor and from the bishop that if we go to worship they will attack again,” the pastor told Compass. “By the constitution of Lebanon, we have the freedom to worship there. But they say, ‘Okay, go try to practice your rights, but we will stop you.’”

"WP:GUNS importance assessment
As you surmised, the ten percent standard is intended to be interpreted as an order of magnitude, rather than a difference between a disqualified 9 percent and a qualified 11 percent. I am certainly open to alternative suggestions to clarify the criterion; but I disagree about the absence of sources to define an order of magnitude quantification.

The American gun culture includes a large number of writers who emphasize opinions rather than pursuing statistics. As the internet allows anyone to screen for information sources confirming an existing bias, such authors may be well represented by conventional search-engine algorithms. I personally enjoyed articles by Elmer Keith and Jack O'Connor relating divergent first-hand experiences hunting with light or heavy bullets; but I sought out articles by Julian Hatcher to find results of side-by-side scientific method comparisons.

I believe sources are available to quantify the features qualifying as top importance articles. It may be difficult to find quantification in the popular press (including the anti-gun press); but well-researched sources are worth the effort required to find them.

Assessment of importance requires a fundamental understanding of the subject; and the amount of time required will vary inversely with the experience of the editor. I wouldn't encourage you to undertake this assessment task with an unrealistic impression of the knowledge or time required. As a practical matter, however, you may understand the subject well enough to know the answer after reading the article. If you think the subject represented more than ten percent of the firearms or ammunition, it's probably a top importance article; but it's probably not top importance if you have doubts. I doubt your decisions on that basis will be challenged; but it shouldn't be an unreasonable task to find documentation on the few which might be.",0

Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.

Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs

2) At School Number One Vladimir was horribly ambitious and looked dosn on the other kids of his age: Там у Владимира проявились болезненная амбициозность и презрительное отношение к ровесникам.
(other sources claim Boris was a hooligan: so he differed from the kids his age in the opposite way)
3) No info on the father after their return, but since other sources claim among other things that Anatoly often visited his son in jail and was convinced he was innocent, I think they again lived together.
4) Vladimir did not arrive at the funeral on his own, but in the company of two bearded friends, one of whom villagers later recognized amongh the dead Beslan hostage takers: Да не один, а в компании двух никому не знакомых бородачей - одного из них потом эльхотовцы опознали среди убитых в Беслане террористов.
5) After the Islamic funeral, VK went back to the village and pushed the tables with drinks around, referring to Islamic law, and threatened to shoot the people gathered there: Вернувшись в село, где начинались поминки, Ходов попытался перевернуть столы с выпивкой, ссылаясь на законы фундаментального ислама. И даже пригрозил расстрелять собравшихся.
6) The journalist asked the Militia minister of Northern Ossetia whether the freeing of VK proved that he had powerful protectors in  the local police department (ROVD). """"I do not exclude that possibility"""". Я не исключаю такой возможности”, - ответил мне Сослан Иванович.
7) Aleksandra already left Elkhotovo before the village council decide to banish her. According to rumours she went to live with someone she knew in Vladikavkaz: Ну а мать террористов еще до решения сельского схода уехала из Эльхотова. По слухам она перебралась к знакомым во Владикавказ. (Vladikavkaz is the capital of North Ossetia. I doubt very much that a village council has the right to banish someone from North Ossetia.)

"Issues 
Well, I am very displeased with this article and with wikipedia for not wishing to ensure that all sides of the issue be reported on this sensitive topic.  The integrity of this article is only about a 50 out of 100. I too have added information to the introduction of this article lending mere existance to the fact that global warming is still disputed by some, and it too has dissappeared or was even removed by wikipedia.  I believe that enough discussion has occurred here, as per their request, to warrant that tiny tidbit of informaton being sited fairly in the INTRODUCTION of this article, alongside the rant in the INTRODUCTION that argues for global warming.  If Wikipedia cannot do something so simple and fair and chooses to support silencing those whose views are contrary to their own, as a supposedly fair, balanced, and factual encyclopedia, I will have to boycott further use of this resource, because it's no resource when the information in it is purposefully skewed and where the encyclopedia takes actions that blatently support the skewing of information and the omission of facts.  Wikipedia monitors this article has has repeatedly removed such additions that alter the single-sided position of this article, for one my own addition.  Therefore, wikipedia, I request once again that this information be added and it's evidence for that sited, WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND WITHOUT DEMEANING LANGUAGE, in this article, as this is only fair and factual.  My previous changes are on file and I would not mind them being replaced.  The controversary section isn't enough because it's language is clearly demeaning to any idea that does not support global warming and the introduction starts out stating it as a fact without lending weight to other views.  I don't have a problem with calling global warming a fact, I simply want it stated that it is a fact that many people still dissagree and have good evidence to support that idea.  Just because Al Gore thinks we're headed for death doesn't make it so, as was pointed out in the last post here that just because a leader says that everyone agrees with him doesn't make it true.  I remind you that plenty of action groups, left wing radical groups and individuals, non-existant scientists, and other disreputable groups and people have also supported global warming, and therefore, I want to state for the record that just because an oil tycoon signs against global warming doesn't mean everyone who does isn't credible.  You never hear about the 10s of thousands of scientists that dispute it, but 1 that agrees with GW, he makes the front page.  Anyway, I come down hardest on wikipedia because they're the host of this article and it is their responsibility to make sure its' integrity is maintained, and there they have failed in my opinion.

I do not think this can be excluded as a form of Christianity without committing some basic problems in logic in regards to this definition, in particular the No True Scotsman fallacy. Until you have a good source that not only makes the case but represents the scholarly consensus on the question of a definition of Christianity that is sufficiently inclusive but still exclusive of PC as one of its manifestations of the religion, we do not get to delete the factual statement that PC is a form of Christianity. At most we can state that it is disputed, which Giovanni has done. It does not make any claim regarding the compatibility of Christianity with Nazism, but it does say that PC is a form of Christianity that is consistent with Nazism. If you dispute this, then please state what part parts of PC are not consistent with Nazism as an ideology?

"Regular disclaimer on vandal User:Rovoam 

Dear fellow Wikipedians,

This IP is just one of a whole army of anon IPs used by a well-known vandal User:Rovoam, who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of Wikipedia as THE most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in Wikipedia so far.

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkey-related entries, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, Arran (Azerbaijan), Urartu, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan (disambiguation), Turkey, Kura-Araxes culture, Nakhichevan, Safavids, Karabakh, Khojaly, Khojaly massacre, Stepanakert, Khankendi, Ganja (city), Baku, Demographics of Azerbaijan, .az History of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani language, Azeri, Caucasus, History of Turkey, Oghuz Turks, Ottoman Empire, Turks, Ottoman Turks, Turkic languages, Turkic peoples, Mannaeans, List of Azerbaijanis, and even Template:Europe (removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list).

He also vandalized user pages and talkpages, including User:Tabib, User:Tony Sidaways, (user page and talkpages), User talk:Rdsmith4, User talk:CryptoDerk  (talkpages), User:Weyes, User:Dante Alighieri, User:Chanting Fox.

Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to User:Tony Sidaway, User:Codex Sinaiticus, User:Isomorphic, User:Who, User:Dbachmann, the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

Text moved from article

 has been making extensive changes to the article.  Some of them changed clear and precise to less clear and precise language (such as """"implies that"""" to """"leads to the view that""""), some changed one stylistic approach to another, and some turned U.K. in to U.S. English, but the main section is this:

""""The second horn of the dilemma (known as divine command theory) runs into five main problems. First, it implies that the moral status of things is wildly contingent—if he had wanted to, God could have made rape, murder, and torture morally right. Secondly, it threatens the  normative force of the claim that God is good—it turns into the mere claim that God is consistent, or that God approves of himself. Thirdly, it commits the naturalistic fallacy; to analyze evaluative claims (e.g., that murder is wrong) in terms of what God has or hasn't said is to reduce evaluative claims to mere descriptions of God's activity. Fourthly, it seems to make morality subjective, with moral truths determined by the mere attitudes of an individual. Fifthly, it threatens the conception of God as a  rational being. For, supposing God had a reason for forbidding rape, this reason should also be the reason that rape is wrong. Otherwise, God's decision would have been based on the wrong reason. But if the reason rape is wrong is that God has forbidden it, then it can't be God's reason for forbidding it, on pains of circularity. So God's moral decisions were based either on the wrong reason, or on no reason at all.""""

Some of this can usefully added, but some isn't really acceptable: """"is wildly contingent"""" is not only unencyclopædic style, but is less clear than """"is arbitrary, based merely upon god's whim"""".  It also introduces technical terms where they're not needed (as does """"normative force"""" which, in addition, surely misses the target; it's not the normativity of """"god is good"""" that's at issue, but its status as a meaningful evaluation).  His or her fourth point isn't very commonly raised, and is surely implicit in the other points.  The final point contains material that could be made use of, but is in fact a discussion of the article's first point.   (Μελ Ετητης) """,0

 Reply to No Such User's Opinion 
Not sure if you're able to comprehend, but here are few facts to consider
Serbia was a country during Selimović's life for 19 years before Yugoslavia was (1910-1918 Kingdom of Serbia, 1918-1929 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, 1929 SCS was renamed Yugoslavia)., And it was also one of the Federal Republics of Yugoslavia. This is why on the Yugoslav censuses, """"Serb ethnicity"""" was an option, which Selimovic selected. 
The majority of the members of the Partizans and the Communists were Serbs, being a Serb and being a partizan/communist was not mutually exclusive
Your implication that he changed nationalities from Bosnian to Serbian to spite Sarajevan """"harrasment"""" is ridiculous because he was not addressing his nationality in the letter, but rather his ethnicity, which is an unchangeable characteristic.
The Serbian language's standardization was devised by Karadzic in 1818, 17 years before the Croatian latin alphabet was standardized by Ljudevit Gaj, and 32 years before Serbo-Croatian was devised at the Vienna agreement. If you read Mesa Selimovic's books you would know that the modern standardized Serbian language is older than both modern standardized Croatian and Serbocroatian as he wrote a book discussing Karadzic's reforms. Also there are Croatian and Serbo-Croatian dialects that are not mutually understandable with the modern standardized Serbian that Selimovic wrote in, namely Cakavian and Kajkavian.
You say Biographies are reliable sources. Then read this excerpt from Selimovic's own autobiography """"Sjecanja"""" that he wrote himself and you will find the following quotation: """"Potičem iz muslimanske porodice iz Bosne, a po nacionalnoj pripadnosti sam Srbin. Pripadam srpskoj literaturi"""" -> TRANSLATION: I COME FROM A MUSLIM FAMILY FROM BOSNIA, BUT BY ETHNICITY I AM A SERB. I BELONG TO SERBIAN LITERATURE

 Completion date 

Once again, someone has changed the completion date to 30 June '09, though this time they have modified the reference so it no longer shows the photo with the billboard saying 30 Dec '08.  The new reference is now to the main page at http://burjdubaiskyscraper.com which does indeed say 30 June '09.  My question is: can burjdubaiskyscraper.com be considered a reliable source?

I think we should change the completion to 2009, but not include an exact date.  Since burjdubaiskyscraper.com is just a third-party site, I do not think they can be trusted with knowing the official information.  But, Emporis.com does have a completion date of 2009; they can be trusted.  Also, I do not know how anyone can know the exact date of the completion of a building.  It would be best to just stick to the year.   (talk | contributions) 

    

 Height in early March 2008 

Several editors have changed the height of the Burj Dubai from 604.9 m to 611.3 m.  I have changed it back to 604.9 metres as no official statment has yet been made by Emaar.  I propose that the height not be changed unless Emaar makes an official statement or there is a change of the height on the Burj Dubai's official site: www.burjdubai.com.  Since only the developer knows the exact height, we should not use any updates or information from other sources.  Once the height on the official website is updated should we change the height here on Wikipedia.   (talk | contributions) 
I agree.  One official source is better than many conflicting unofficial sources.    

 Remaining milestones 
I have my doubts whether the Petronius oil platform qualifies as a """"world's tallest freestanding structure"""" and as a milestone for Burj Dubai to pass.  Most of it's structure is below water and therefore doesn't qualify under CTBUH rules.    
I do not have an opinion on the issue, just a few comments.  Consensus is that it is not considered the tallest; and therefore may not warrant being included as a milestone.  But, despite that, it does stand taller than the CN Tower, even if it is in water.  It will not hurt if we keep it, and will not be a major deal if we take it away.  Let us see if anyone else has an opinion.   (talk | contributions) 

 At this rate, we gotta keep all those deep level mines too since they are much 'taller' than any tower or oil platform ever built.
  

Actually, many argue that the Petronius is the """"tallest free-standing structure"""", hence the usual addition of """"on land"""" to the Burj Dubai's title (for now), and previously to the CN Tower's title. So I don't agree that consensus agrees to the contrary; consensus agrees that it is not on land, but there is much support of it being a free-standing structure in general. CTBUH has never released any information about the world's tallest structures; it only measures the height of the tallest buildings, so by its rules the CN Tower also would not count. It is therefore not very relevant in this situation. Anyway, I believe that the Petronius should be kept as a milestone. Cheers, -me 

Would Petronius stand on it's own without buoyancy?   
 Even if it can, a lot of the difficulty of a tall structure is in the construction process.  Oil rigs have a serious advantage there because they don't need tall cranes, because you can access the top with boats.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 32.97.110.142

 No extra autonomy given Canada 1867

""""By the time of Confederation in 1867, this system had been operating in most of what is now central and eastern Canada for almost 20 years. The Fathers of Confederation simply continued the system they knew, the system that was already working, and working well.""""
 The system Forsey is referring to is [responsible government] which was attained in the 1840s. Fathers of Confederation adopted the same system. Some powers already assumed by Legislative Assembly were passed to the federal level of government. No new powers came from Britain.   
Heard 
At its inception in 1867, Canada's colonial status was marked by political and legal subjugation to British Imperial supremacy in all aspects of government - legislative, judicial, and executive.  The Imperial Parliament at Westminster could legislate on any matter to do with Canada and could override any local legislation, the final court of appeal for Canadian litigation lay with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, the Governor General had a substantive role as a representative of the British government, and ultimate executive power was vested in the British Monarch - who was advised only by British Ministers in its exercise.  Canada's independence came about as each of these subordinations was eventually removed.
 What part of """"colonial status"""" and """"political and legal subjugation to British Imperial supremacy in all aspects of government"""" is ambiguous? Where is the """"dominion status"""" here? """"Dominion"""" clearly implied subjugation to the Imperial government in 1867.

 Illegitimate Bifurcation? 

The header states, """"One significant variable between libertarian schools of thought is the degree to which the state should be reduced, with minarchists advocating reduction to just state protection from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and anarchists advocating complete elimination of the state.""""

The implication of this statement is that libertarians fall into two camps, minarchists (colloquially interpreted as """"kind of anarchist"""") to anarchist (see """"anarchist""""). My concern is that this page is giving undue weight to the anarchist cause by explicitly devouring and encompassing libertarian ideology into two camps consistent with a common, unifying denominator (at least etymologically) of anarchism. It's not the anarchist LINKS that are concerning to me with regards to objectivity on this page-we all know they are there. It is the domination of anarchism [to a lesser (minarchist) and greater (anarchist) extent] on the header which concerns me. Colloquial interpretations are significant.

My site, which is my lifes work as a master was deemed unreliable by non-chess players. Here is the analysis in regards to the pinksi line.

Hi, I agree with you. Unfortunately, due to personal commitment at Sikhiwiki.org and in real life, I am not able to deal with this matter at present. This user appears to just deal with the meat issue only and has made no attempt to help build Wikipedia or Sikhi on Wikipedia in any other area. I suggest that if you are familiar with any of the tools to deal with this person by contacting him directly or other means, please do so. I feel direct contact may be the best initial approach. Unfortunately, I believe that I may have had some dealing with this person at Sikhiwiki where he was very aggressive and was not prepared to provide any creditable references or any direct evidence. 

He and a few others at the Sikh-History.com are bent on propagating their views without any backing from SGGS or other recorded evidence. A lot of the Sikh history is being twisted by these people at their site. They will go to any lengths to promote their views. For example, the Sakhi of Guru Gobind Singh and Madho Das (Banda Bahadar) has been twisted without any credible historical records been quoted or researched.

Unfortunately, I do not at present have the time to deal with these people but I think that their approach of promoting their views under the Sikhism banner is deplorable and needs to be restrained. All the views promoted by Sikhs must have a credible backing from SGGS or other renowned scholars like Bhai Gurdas and we must be able to check these references  or translation. These people have at one point said that 4 translations of SGGS are wrong and their views are correct. I appreciate your concern and you have my support in dealing with this problem.

"""==This User's Abuse of his Admin status, deliberate posting of proven misinformation==

According to WP:LINKSTOAVOID article 2: """"Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research"""" cannot be included in wikipedia.  has purposefully breached this policy in his continuing personal vendetta against me. Here is the proof:

After repeatedly being warned by myself against the misleading and factually inaccurate material presented on an external webpage Janet Marlow's site admin  still intentionally linked to this misinformative page in the following edit: 

 

 has since made the (above) statement: """"there is no misinformation on the particular page to which I linked. Both sides are describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings. Whether that is four """"resonances"""" or eight is a non-issue.""""

Not only is  mistaken in claiming that there is no misinformation on the page, or that the two sides in the argument are describing the same thing, he has clearly been abusing his status as an administrator. Let us first consider the contents of this argument:

The page to which  linked makes the following claims:

""""Therefore, there are four missing sympathetic resonances on the six string guitar. If you play a C,  Bb, Ab, and Gb on the first string E,  there will be less sustain from these notes than the others because there are no sympathetic resonant strings. This was Maestro Yepes’ primary reason for conceiving the ten-string guitar. By adding these pitches in four extra bass strings, now provides each half step with the sympathetic resonance making a more physically completed instrument."""" (Janet Marlow Janet Marlow's site)

Now, in western classical music there are 12 notes in the octave: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B. If it is claimed (as above) that four of these notes lack resonances, then logically/mathematically, this means that the other eight out of the twelve do not lack resonances. Marlow lists the four missing resonances as C, Bb (=A#), Ab (=G#), and Gb (=F#) and states that """"there will be less sustain from these notes than the others"""". Any person who is a competent speaker of the English language will understand this as meaning that these four listed notes have more sustain (more resonance) than the other notes, the """"other notes"""" being C#, D, D#, E, F, G, A, B. In other words, Marlow is claiming four notes don't have resonance and eight do.

However, Narciso Yepes (who invented the modern 10-string guitar) always, ubiquitously and verifiably talked about eight missing sympathetic resonances on the guitar, not four as claimed by Marlow. Yepes lists the eight missing resonances as C, C# (=Db), D# (=Eb), F, F# (=Gb), G, G# (=Ab), A# (=Bb). He lists the other four notes that do have resonance as D, A, E, and B. Yepes's quotes from numerous articles/interviews can be read here  with references to follow them up. There is also further information on my site www.tenstringguitar.INFO about the acoustics, the science behind Yepes's statements.

Janet Marlow (and ) are clearly, in fact, not saying the same thing as Narciso Yepes (and Viktor van Niekerk). Both sides are certainly not """"describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings"""", as  is falsely claiming. If they were describing the same thing, Marlow would have to speak of eight missing resonances (C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, G, Ab, Bb) not only four (C, Bb, Ab, Gb).

 only goes on to claim that """"Whether that is four """"resonances"""" or eight is a non-issue"""" because to admit the truth - that it is very much an issue and a source of misinformation - would reveal his involvement in not only deliberately promoting misinformation on wikipedia (going against WP:LINKSTOAVOID article 2), but also misusing his status as an administrator to abuse me in his ongoing personal vendetta over an edit disagreement. This defamatory conduct includes, but is hardly limited to his claim (below) that Janet Marlow """"is a more authoritative figure than Viktor"""", despite the fact that Marlow has been proven to publish misinformation while my website www.tenstringguitar.INFO is presently the only online resource that faithfully represents Narciso Yepes's statements about his invention as well as a scholarly explanation of the",0

Further, you try to condemn me for doing exactly what you are doing. However, I did not do those things. You presume to educate me, while it is painfully obvious that you are only a very poorly-educated person. You accuse me of making a personal attack that does not improve the article.

"Fruitella Edit - Not By me, 

Dear GofW, I just saw that I was supposed to have made some changes to the entry for Fruitella. Nope. One reason why I didn't, is because I have no idea what that is, and another is that I am currently banned from editing until sometime in the future. If you look at what is supposed to be my userpage (I say supposed because I have a Blackberry which seems to share an IP with probably 28 million other people), you will see a whole catalogue of entries I am supposed to have edited in a negative fashion to the extent that I was banned from making further edits. The problem is that I only edited 2 entries - for The Russell Tribunal and Stop The War. I firmly disagree with the reasons given for reverting these 2 edits - both organisations are openly anti-Israeli (and actually quite happy to be portrayed as such). I merely pointed this out. The problem with Wiki is that people who really know nothing of such entities are charged with protecting them, so the result is detrimental. Often in a language which they don't speak very well.

Removing some wiki links from """"External Links"""" section (These links are irrelevant to post-disco): a Hi-NRG link and Italo Disco link. In fact, Post-disco influenced italo-disco in beginnings, but italo-disco is other class music. Taking it all, Italo-disco link you can find in infobox, in """"Derivative forms"""" segment.   

 Dance-rock redirection 

I change the dance-rock redirection, from dance music to  [[Post-disco#Dance-Rock]] . From actual-point-of-view , Dance-Rock can not have its own article, because of its sources. Dance-Rock's only source is All Music Guide, so there can be a WP:V problem. Anyway, Google finds """"nothing"""" (only just irrelevant pages), except.. yes AMG and Last.fm. However, some remarking have page of Billboard magazine from 2004.

I also created Dance-Rock redirect.   

AllMusic source
This article is one of a number of music genre articles that were created solely using AllMusic as a source, and for which few other sources seemed to be available. I'd rather have just deleted it, but decided instead to trim and rephrase it so that it was perfectly clear that elevating the term """"post-disco"""" to genre status was apparently an attempt to fill a gap in AllMusic's taxonomy of genres, and that it was the creation of a now-uncredited individual author who was paid to write it. Also I wanted to show the author never really defined it as a musical style; it wasn't ever established how it was related to disco on one end and house music on the other.

Recently the article has been expanded to cite other mentions of """"post-disco"""". I'm fine with that, but I'm not convinced every use of the term was really intended to be interpreted as a genre name. I'm just afraid this article is doing the exact same thing the AllMusic blurb did: trying too hard to give traction to a name for something that really didn't have a name, or that perhaps was only called """"boogie"""". I feel like I'd rather see a section of the Boogie article devoted to the dance music genre than to continue down the road of searching for vague references to dance music in the post-disco era as evidence of an accepted genre name. —  
My opinion is that post-disco is also genre (""""boogie""""), but also a movement, but that's WP:POV. I don't know.. I mean I don't understand what's really """"post-disco"""" (after disco era / boogie genre ?) means at all. If it is """"era"""" so all tracks to present is """"post-disco"""", but if it is a genre... (unsourced; only AMG and some kind of sites like """" danceclassics.net"""" etc).   

 OR & source misrepresentation in lead: analysis 

None of the cited sources other than Allmusic suggest that """"post-disco"""" is a genre. Many of the citations are also WP:SPS.

The term post-disco (or simply boogie) has multiple meanings. Citation does not support the assertion that """"post-disco"""" has multiple meanings or that it is a term interchangeable with Boogie

Sometime after 1990,AMG was founded in 1991 —  an Allmusic editorial contributor used """"post-disco"""" in an attempt to isolate a dance music genre in the era between the indistinct """"end"""" of disco music and the equally indistinct emergence of house music. Proposition unsupported by a third party verifiable source, this is editorial analysis therefore WP:OR

 Let me add a comment here in this discussion.  While it certainly seems strange that jokes are included on a page concerning 'religion', dismissing it completely without some discussion and consideration would be doing a disservice.  It may very well be that Bektashi culture is intimately tied to a rich collection of jokes which serve some pedagogical role in the religion.  For example, if we look at this site:
 http://www.alevibektasi.org/xalevis1.htm
 It is written that 
""""X. Alevi-Bektashi Humor
Alevis and Bektashis love to use humor to mock religious legalism, hypocrisy, and those who they feel have persecuted them. This humor reveals much about Alevi-Bektashi thought. To understand their humor is to understand the Alevi-Bektashis’ approach to life, religion, and their place in society. Here are only a few examples of the hundreds of Bektashi jokes (fıkralar) that have been collected.
This first joke reflects the Alevi attitude toward the legalism of the five pillars""""

 The author is John Shindeldecker, and he is listed as one of the researchers on the fairly official-looking homepage 
 http://www.alevibektasi.org/makale_engl.htm
 In this case, this material suggests that humor is an integral part of defining Bektashi culture as distinctive from other factions of Islam.  Much as Zen Buddhism is characterized by the sometimes meaningless Koans or Gospel music in certain factions of Protestant Christianity.  In all of these cases, I don't think it's fair to say that it's like """"adding black jokes to an article about African Americans.""""  This comparison is also a bit overreaching, and unwarranted.  AldirmaGonul has made a good faith case for why the jokes should be placed on this page.  freestylefrappe has deleted it by only saying that it's """"suspect"""" and """"racist"""".  But given what we read from another source, this seems an overly simplified and inaccurate depiction of the """"jokes"""" section.

You Can't Stop Me
Dear Bongwarrior

My suspicion is that you are suffering major shrinkage from the inordinate amount of cannabis you have consumed over the course of your useless life. I understand that the prostitutes you procure so regularly laugh at the size of your penis, however I would implore you not to let this shortcoming (if you'll pardon the pun) stamp out the fun that happy, prosperous and sexually capable teenagers can have vandalising wikipedia. Hopefully you wake up and learn that those of us who don't want to consume cannabis, live of welfare payments, drop out of university and edit """"incoherent ramblings"""" on Wikipedia for a living may want to have a facet to their lives which does grant them fun without having to chase pink elephants around their parent's basements all day. 

Also, Bongwarrior is two words - and therefore in my opinion your username constitutes an """"incoherent rambling"""". But then again, your probably too high and sexually deprived to employ any reason and acknowledge this. You're parents having """"relations"""" is probably one of the most costly mistakes that society will have to bear - because undoubtably everybody else's taxes will be use to subsidise the treatment you receive for schizophrenia in five years. Seriously mate, just get a fuggen life, because you're not going to stamp on my fun.

"Title of article in English wikipedia 

This morning, a wikipedian moved this page to a version including the full Vietnamese diacritics.  I just moved it back to the version without diacritics, for the following reasons:
 this is the English-language article about Ngo; and the great majority of English text written about Ngo (and other Vietnamese generally) do not include diacritics.  In English, in fact, inclusion of the diacritics is of no effect (at best) or even confusing because they have no effect on pronunciation in standard English orthography.  (Please note I am by no means an English-language bigot: I am a student of the Vietnamese language, and understand the fundamental role diacritic marks fulfill in correctly differentiating phonemes in Vietnamese.  However, it is clear that in English, the diacritics play no role in pronunciation.)
 The Wikipedia guidelines on naming conventions asserts that the most commonly used spelling in English is the form that should be used.

""""Dr. Robert L.

That was not the case for subjects of this study. There was in fact a marked decline in depression after their effort to change.” (Archives of Sexual Behavior, Vol. 38, No. 5, October 2003, p 403. 200 subjects, 143 men and 57 women, were personally interviewed by Dr. Spitzer.)""""

I am not trying to avoid your question about the BMA, though it's not relevant in connection with the present article.  Yes, I would personally view the BMA as a pro-choice advocacy group.

I admit that it is hypothetically possible that opposition to reducing abortion time limits might be motivated by concerns about late diagnosis of fetal abnormalities.  As you know, such abortions account for a very tiny fractions of abortions, but you're correct that concern about such situations could hypothetically cause someone to block a general reduction in time limits.

However, RCOG has said it is pro-choice, explicitly supporting """"rights of women to exercise personal choice.""""

Neutrality tag
The tagged section is not only neutral, it is primary verification of what JfJ claim to believe. It would be very odd indeed if the communism article did not reference communist sources for what communists believe. The section states what JfJ believe, it makes no claims about what Wiki believes, nor what the editor who put it there believes, nor what a reader should believe. It is therefore an verifiable NPOV reporting of a group that is itself obviously not neutral. My reading of this article is that although technically neutral in its presentation, it starts by presenting all the negative views of JfJ. That does not seem logical. A neutral reader wants to know firstly what JfJ believe, then what others say, neutral, pro and con. Example:

No one can rationally deny anyone's ethnic affiliation, this is certain. The fact that Starčević did this to the descendands of the Orthodox  Vlachs is not a sign of political wisdom, or even ordinary logic. But, it must be underscored that he reacted to the denial of Croatian ethnic affiliation promulgated by Vuk Karadžić's pan-Serbian ideology.

"Your welcome to rebut away. First off, GoodDay, you seem to have a dislike for anything other than English being on wikipedia even though there is no English equivalent word, as shown in this diff.

Perhaps it is because you are too stubborn. I would rather that than think you just dislike every language other than English.

"Oh dear Rick, we are back your misunderstanding of what probability means.  I am not sure if we are allowed to discus this any more, perhaps it is OK on this page.

Richard confirms above that there are two interpretations of probability, Bayesian and frequentist.  Although they both should give the same answer to any exact question it is very confusing to flip interpretation in the middle of an argument.  I am happy to discuss the MHP using either model but let us start with the Bayesian perspective first.

To a Bayesian, probability is a state of knowledge.  That is the definition of what Bayesian probability means.  In the Bayesian model, what is not known does not exist.  That is not something  that I have just made up, I am sure Richard will confirm it or you can confirm it using WP or any good text book.  So, if the player does not know where the car is placed, or the host's door opening strategy, the probability of winning by switching is exactly 2/3.  It may be that the car is always placed behind door 2 and the host always opens door 3 but, if we do not know that, it makes no difference to our (Bayesian) probability calculation, which depends by definition only on the information that we have, .  The concept of average probability makes no sense, there is just 'the probability' which is based only on our state of knowledge.",0

Regards, Skomorokh 
I intend to run as this shows I have over 1,700 edits; more than qualifying me to stand for the position and at any rate this election needs all the candidates it can get.   
That link indicates you have 728 mainspace edits, not 1000 (and some of those 728 have been made since Nov 1st14th). Sorry, Skomorokh 
Either way I intend to run anyway. And if you look at the guideline for edits you will see that it actually says November 14, not November 1.   
My mistake, it is November 14 as you say. However, you still do not meet the threshold for article space edits and so are prohibited from running. Sincerely, Skomorokh 
You seem to have a rather strong position on this...   
My error regarding the date aside, it's pretty black and white. Sincerely, Skomorokh 
I have withdrawn my self-nomination, but I believe that the lack of nominees this time around is due to unfriendly messages such as above. I hope that I will have enough edits next time around to qualify.   
I apologise if you found my messages unfriendly, that was very much not my intention. You have the misfortune of being the first ineligible candidate this year, so I do not think this can be attributed as the reason for the lack of nominations. Best, Skomorokh 
CommentBarts1a, the requirement is for mainspace edits (not total edits). You don't appear to meet the requirement.  
No wonder candidates are so few and far between...   
There are many thousands of wikipedians who easily exceed those requirements, and while I don't know if the minimum requirements are the same as last year, I suspect that all the successful and most of the unsuccessful candidates in previous years had rather more than a thousand mainspace edits. Any explanation for the paucity of candidates would need to explain why fewer of the qualified candidates are standing. ''SpielChequers'' 
Too much paperwork (Mostly one editor's fault) and a week filled with people saying nasty things about you?  For most of us, RfA was enough, and I leaned my lesson last year.  

Barts1a, I'm not sure why you've requested comment on this. It is a black and white standard. I don't know the reason behind it, but I would guess it is to ensure that only Wikipedia contributors that have a certain level of experience and dedication to the project are allowed to run in the ArbCom elections. Of course, counting",0

Your request for rollback

Hi Leszek Jańczuk.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).  I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into troubles or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback.  Thank you for helping to reduce vandalism.  Happy editing!   ''''''  Let's talk about it! """,0

"""

a side note on the high art of casting the ordinary trivial, into something special
This does not mean that what Risteski wrote on the guitar is not of value. Of course there may be interesting things there. Same with other methods, etc. But this whole topic (guitar pedagogy) seems to be one, where I can get information from anyone, even my neighbor. In other words: The body of knowledge related to guitar pedagogy is, to a great extent, not specialist knowledge with easy categorization of the sources of various ideas. Hence I detest when Risteski writes """"this work will introduce a new guitar teaching philosophy on the virtue of musical-aesthetical knowledge of classical guitar music"""". What he wishes to display as something """"new"""", is rather something that I could easily learn and find, while having discussions with my friends, with a glass of wine. So 'cheers' to guitar philosophy!  

At the same time, I can look at the article and see it empty. Risteski's articles can at least provide some food for thought; and that would be a reason to include them in the external links. I suggest: let's mix a cocktail of philosophical guitar pedagogical content. Add sugar to taste!   
writing articles for wikipedia is different than writing a """"term paper"""" for school or a commentary for a newspaper or a book that you wish to have published. In all of those occaisions you as a writer are supposed to look at primary sources and material published by others, analyse them and put them togehter in ways that support your original thesis. Taking that approach to Wikipedia articles is not acceptable as it violates our no original research policy. For Wikipedia articles writers must take material and analysis that has already been published by others and create and article that reflects all current thought on the topic, giving appropriate propotion to each. 
And again, tagging an external link that does not meet our guidelines for external links onto the end of an article that is not in good shape is NOT an improvement to the article. The Red Pen of Doom """,0

""""I don't understand why you think the definition belongs only with momentum/time.""""  the reason is pedagogical within the physics discipline.  it would be a tautology to define the Joule as the amount of energy required to move a body against a force of 1 Newton the distance of 1 meter, then at the same time, define the Newton as 1 Joule per meter.  it's true but it says nothing about the quantities of the Joule or of the Newton (nor anything about their dimesion).  it is not like the chicken and egg, we know which one comes first (meter, kg, second come first, then the Newton before the Joule). the Planck force is a derived unit and will have to be the Planck unit of momentum divided by the Planck unit of time.  the fact that it comes out to be the basic tension in string theory or in, general relativity, the force that is the conversion factor between spacetime curvature and the energy density giving rise to it or, if multiplied by the fourth power of the (dimensionless) circular orbit speed some distance from a central body that it tells what the body would weigh at that distance, all these are fine and good, but they are the result of working out hypothesized physics problems, they are not the definition.  what if you worked out some other basic physics problem (say the basic tension of a string) and it came out to be 2 FP? or 4 π FP?  would you say that the force solutions to such are the definition of the Planck force?  it doesn't matter what the system of units are, once you have those 5 base units defined, there is no freedom left to define the others.  their definitions are purely consequential.

Gwen I am sorry that you refuse to provide accountability for the actions you undertook as an Admin.  Accountability is simply providing the basis for which you are creating a block to an editor. 
Since you seem determined to obfuscate and side step in every possible way, instead of simply giving reasons of what I did to merit getting blocked, it does seem that my asking for your cooperation here has run its course.  Your assumption of bad faith of why I am asking for clarification are rude and uncalled for, and clearly self-serving.  I asked you a straight question.  You are not willing to give any justification for why you blocked me.  It is reasonable for me to ask.
The block was reviewed by an interested party, and then removed by an uninterested admin, whom did not see the reasons why you blocked me, it does not feel that you even reviewed why this block was overturned.
As I said Gwen, asking you on a your talk page seems to have run its course.  I am left with the perception that admin functions were not used properly, and interested parties where involved along that side.

""""Vaguely""""?!  Really?!  I've explained this in great detail, ... but whatever.  Let me see if I can clearly explain how these subjects interrelate:
Various figures of differing fame have proposed teleological arguments for the existence of God (technically any god, but for all practical matters, this mostly concerns the Christian God).  These arguments from design are described in the Teleological argument article.  They are rarely referred to as simply """"intelligent design,"""" and thus, have little to no claim to that term for its common name.
A specific teleological argument is presented as science and an alternative to evolution.  This purportedly scientific theory is called Intelligent design (ID) and it is described here, in the Intelligent design article.  It is not necessarily associated with the Discovery Institute, and therefore claiming that this is the """"DI version"""" is inaccurate.  There are no strict """"versions"""" of the teleological argument anyway; there are different arguments from design made by different people, and they are identified by the philosopher/theologian who proposed them.
From my perspective, the articles are well-organized, though not above improvements.  If the name of the article on the """"scientific theory"""" is a problem, we ought to have a discussion about the names of these articles, instead of trying to manipulate the lead of this one and obscure its topic.  If """"Intelligent design"""" is deemed to be the common name of the subject currently described in Teleological argument, there needs to be a discussion with the folks there to change the name.  This article can then be renamed to something else (in the past, I've suggested adding creationism to the title).

"==re-PWT==
It was PWT - I've appended my reply to John Leach below. I have to admit that my students and occasionally I have goaded him but quite frankly he writes rubbish and when challanged when he was a member of the ACS, he responded with a tirade of highly offensive e-mails. By following his posts re-1728 one can see what kind of mind is at work. First Maun's book did not exist, then someone 'reliable' told him it did. He bought it and he will analyse it to see if it is any good! Now it is but John has made mistakes and he's not willing to admit it so although he knows he is posting nonsense, he continues writing some hubris regarding his sources. JohnLp - Blackjack is not a valid source. Anyone can copy out from books by McCann et al but BJ adds his own POV - pages of it. Remove it and he goes beserk. I leave you all to it because as PWT said - all the people interested don't use WP - they have the books. I worry that the whole project is becoming dominated by him and his chums. Follow AA's edits - they are enthusiastic but contain many errors. Change them and you are a sockpuppet or what ever it is - that from Leachy who's had a least a dozen. As you can imagine, at a Uni we have several severs and infinite possible user names. We have to do this because whenever we use oner BJ has it block. it's your problem on WPCric but it is serious becaUause within the next two issues, an ACS member(I am not a member) is writing a damning critique. It is a terrible shame because there are many superb entries. Many of thise by BJ are flawed, some are plain wrong. Anyhow best of luck. (I thought he was on vacation incidentally, or working! You get the drift.)

PWT
I was at Trent Bridge and I asked PWT to intervene to prevent the cricket site becoming corrupted with errors and Blackjacks efforts to move the contents of his site to WP. We discussed it and contacted KW who agreed there was a chance Blackjack's personalised style of editing was perpetrating errors because he lacked the level of source we have. How sad we have from BJ more hysterical self promotion. I got a student to have a look and they think you have used at least six sock puppets yourself. What makes all this so sad is that the edits you previously posted are fully available. Quite frankly, I don't know what your problem is John. You sent highly offensive emails to PWT which we were looking at on Friday - you sent offensive emails to the editor of the Cricket Statistcian. Neither I, nor Peter have altered pre 1750 cricket with other than the correct information. If Rambling Man(similar to your own Midnight Rambler Blackjack(see his blog)) wants to block these sites he is of course able to do it. What he will be doing is to enable Blackjack/JamesJJames/Albert WM or whatever it ws and several others to become sole editor. A man who has operated multiple sock puppets and is not regarded as an authority by Peter , Keith or any of the acknowledged expert who have publish books of great authority. I know Maun's view of John but it is for him to put it forward. It was PWT who edited and in response to JohnLp added some comments. It is indicative of the thrall Blackjack has laid over half a dozen people that this project is allowing a string of entries riddled with errors that could easily be altered and referenced by those with the correct sources, carry on because for some reason he is their man. WP is about facts not opinions. See 1728 Cricket for the facts on all newspaper entries for that year. Blackjack wants those blocked who spoil his game and I can, by private email, show anyone who wishes more evidence of his approach through his communications with people who disagree with him. The John Leach(MP) wasd posted by a student but you will recall that Blackjack at one time posted his own biography. It was more accurate - marginally.

Three lawsuits in 50 years barely deserves inclusion.A subheading signals importance equal to the subheading given a larger more prevalent topic such as cult or religion.The lawsuits use greater quantity of text than warranted relevant to other sections in the article.

The Jesus article may be a person’s first impression of Jesus.  It would be nice if their first impression was from a Christian or the Bible, but for so many in these new days it probably comes from the Internet. Watch the Jesus page to keep it focused on Him. Thanks a lot.

Also, watch out to follow Wikipedia's Policies and guidelines.  It is especially hard for the Three-revert rule and the Neutral point of view policy to be followed because of the nature of the article, but please follow these policies along with citing sources so that the article does not get locked from editing and can't be improved further.  Thanks again.  """,0

"""

Laughable, eh? What's so funny about it? You make a claim, yet have no logical basis to base it on. Look into this more closely, there IS a Standard English, what standard do you think the UN uses for all English-speaking countries. """"Yeah, there are many English speaking countries, but let's just use Britains dialect, for no reason whatsoever!"""", is this what you think goes on in New York? Lol, anyways, did I say that leaving Wikipedia just the way it is results in a less informative encyclopedia? I said no such thing! My argument is that the inherent nature of an encyclopedia is that ALL of the information is based on one standard, so the reader doesn't get confused, and that this inherent nature must be present in Wikipedia as well! It's like trying to subtract X from Z, and expecting a numerical answer, it just doesn't mutually comply, and doesn't work well with an organized, compiled database of informative facts. I agree with you 100% that enhancing your knowledge of dialects is important, but it's just as important as learning how gum is made, learning more about George Washington, and learning what blood is made of, in a relative sense. And this is EXACTLY why there was an article on American/British spelling differences, just as there are articles for chewing gum, George Washington, and blood, and EXACTLY why I chose to raise this issue on that certain articles Talk Page. That's what encyclopedias are for, LEARNING, but learning at your OWN careful and deliberate discretion, not someone elses.

Ok, sir, my mistake for not checking my facts, but I just assumed, obviously wrongly, that words like """"pedophile"""" are pronounced the same in both British and American dialects, but only because I've heard British people pronounce pedophile as """"PED-OH-PHILE"""". So, like a normal intelligent person would do, they would make a claim with a reasonable logic base, and not just personal agenda. And you seem to think that I've never heard of that """"ae"""" being merged as one letter, do you seriously take me as a fool? Hope not, beause only a fool and an intellect would raise this issue in the first place, and I am by NO means a fool. Well, I've made mistakes in my past, but so has everybody, right? But in the scholastic sense, I am no fool, at all. Anyways, just incase you AGAIN misread what I wrote, I didn't claim to believe they pronounce it """"PAH-EHD-OH-PHILE"""", I was just giving an example for my statement """"there are words common in both the British and English dialect that in the British dialect aren't spelled as pronounced"""". I assumed, based on my reasonings in the first sentence of this paragraph, that both the British and Americans pronounce this word, and similar words, identically. According to you, I am false on this, but I do not have much faith in your credibility, so I will have to look deeper into this one. ANYWAYS, the reason I even made this argument is that you rebutted my original statement that read somewhere along the lines of """"generally speaking, English words are pronounced as spelled, letter-by-letter"""" with the fact that the word """"color"""" is spelled """"colour"""" in Britain, yet it is pronounced """"CUH-LIHR"""". 

O.K., we're kind of going in circles here, so lets just concentrate on the main issue(s) here. There are many words that have greek or latin prefixes, yet the word itself isn't related to the meaning of given prefix(es). This is, as far as I know, just coincidence, and unfortunately, partially due to the fact that it's late and I'm tired, I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, but you should know some yourself. Actually, I CAN think of them, but I'm too lazy, and it would be quite redundant, for lack of a better term. So therefore, strictly speaking, """"pedophilia"""" is by NO accounts a word for """"foot fetish"""".

You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so. I agree with you 110% that no one is """"better"""" than the other, but """"better"""" is very subjective and I'm strictly speaking from an objective point of view. O.K., just so we're on the same page, I'll reword my argument as best I can, for I am pretty tired, so we can stop going in circles:

""""Wikipedia is a database of information, and as a database (and also an encyclopedia), there must be a standard setting, language, consolidation, unification, etc., so that the information is clear, proper, and concise. In order to acheive this unity, there must be a standard for which all other articles are based. It makes no sense not use the dialect that the majority of the English-speaking world uses, and to use one that a minority, regardless of quantitative value, uses. Therefore, since the majority of the English-speaking world uses the so-called """"American-English"""" as the st",0

Simliar to Talk to the Hand: Live in Michigan, I would like to suggest that the title of the page be moved to Disc One.

Hello, MusicTeacherClub. I appreciate your efforts and thank you for contributing to our encyclopedia.

I'm sorry to inform you that you're contravening Wikipedia principles, namely Wikipedia is not a publisher of original research and accounts must not be shared. Unfortunately, this may lead to your being blocked or your contributions being removed.

Wikipedia tries to aggregate information that reliable sources have previously published; we do not publish original research ourselves. If we allowed that kind of thing, we would be putting two fundamental tenets—WP:Verifiability and WP:Neutral point of view—in jeopardy. I advise you to save copies of your articles to your computers, particularly Learning-Disadvantage Gap, as it may be deleted from Wikipedia soon.

A less fundamental problem is that shared accounts are not allowed. I don't really know why (I'm pretty new here); maybe we've had problem editors hide under group accounts in the past. Whatever the reason, the fact that you are a group of people sharing one account is grounds for blocking.

I'm sorry to bear bad news. I wish you good luck in finding a publisher.

"Are you even listening to me? In 1838, the Armenian Oblast (Armenian province) population was numbering of about 165,000 people according to statistics, about half were Armenian(excluding the later 200,000 on its seroundings who later immigrated). In 1924 the population of Azerbaijan was of 2 million, 75% were Azeri Tartars, it compromised of Baku province , Elizavetpol Province and the adjoining districts, (including Nagorno Karabakh and Nakhochevan). From 250-300,000 Armenians were moved from Julfa, Erivan and Nakhichevan in 1604 and following, if you claim that there was even as much Muslim there, you are totally ignoring the history of the period. Since the partial control by the Ottoman, Nakhichevan and Erivan served as depots of goods, intermedary from the Ouest and East, Persia even further pushed that but replaced the Armenians who would rather trade on the Shah's capital. You claim having provided data, but you have provided absolutly nothing, because the only things you have provided, even before I covered them, and what you present in no way contradict what you claim. A projection of that much people (250-300,000), to claim that Tartars at least presented that much in the Western zone, would have been just sensless.

What I have provided.

1-That there were reasons specifically targetting Armenians which do not apply and were not applied to Muslims.

2-I have provided materials excluding the Muslims in reference to the depopulation.

3-I have provided materials equating the population with the word Armenian.

4-I have provided a reference prior to Gultestan Treaty, and you dismissed the author, while in Wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources. What you think of the author is original research.

You answered by presenting 13-14th century and post Gulestan materials, which in no way have I contested nor do they contradict what I have been saying. I have provided figures of Armenian moved, which by projection represent 2 million or more Armenians if projected for 1918, and those excludes the recorded numbers of Armenians who escaped depopulation and inspite of it, there still remained a considerable number of Armenians pre Gulestan, which I also documented. I have documented everything I have been claiming, you request things that do not exist, because there was no Nakhochevan delimitation in that period, nor statistics for a bordering which is quite modern in comparaison to Abbas period.

In short, what you have highlighted is that the word Armenian has no place in this article, and that you have no intention to improve it. You know that what you propose is misleading but you still claim it is neutral. As we speak 98% of Nakhichevan population is Azeri, so claiming depopulation could only be misleading in that it suggest that Azeris were those moved when the Armenians were those mostly affected. Obviously here, we do have a problem, and as it appears, you in no way want to correct it.  (ix)",0

 Ward Churchill Admits that He is a Lying SOB

Considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in Indian Country who dared to question his Indian heritage claims over the years, I think that Indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming.  So many peoplewho do NOT even live in Indian Country, who do NOT work in Indian Countrymade the claim that to dare question the great Ward Churchill's fake Indian heritage was a """"cheap shot.""""  We have been hearing that from non-Indians for many, many years and now Churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over 20 years.

When you use id est or """"That is"""" in that context you are expounding upon and explaining the original sentence, e.g., prohibited in article text, that is"""", you can't use it.

I may be wrong but your reference to WP:HiddenFunction concerns hiding text not to a collapsible table.
'''As of December 29, 2006, this technique is disabled on this wiki. The class hiddenStructure still exists in the CSS, but now outlines the text in green instead of hiding the text.

It does not prevent use of similar tags like display: none or visibility: hidden.

The collapsible boxes contain information that serves as an addendum to what is in the article. It adds to the reading experience by making the page neater. The example I used with the """"Genes"""" is a prime example, looking at that abortion is enough to give somebody a headache.

"The Sangharaj holds authority over all monks ordained in the Thai sangha, whether inside or outside of Thailand.  For example, it is through the Sangha council that monks are authorized to perform ordinations and through which the title of 'Somdet' is awarded.  However, the two monasteries you mention are slightly different from most Thai wats you find outside of Thailand.  Most Thai wats, for example here in San Francisco, are closely associated with the Sangha council which is heavily involved in the wat's operation.  (I think)

Amaravati and Abhayagiri pretty different because they are 'forest monasteries' and also because they are for Westerners.  Most forest monasteries tend to be fairly uninvolved with the formal Sangha administration, and doubly so the Westerners.  The various branches of Wat Nanachat tend to do their own thing, but still are bound by the Thai Sangha in certain ways.  For example, only Ajahns Sumedho and Pasanno are authorized by the Sangharaj to perform ordinations, so all ordinations within the branches of Wat Nanachat in the West are done by one of those two, whether here in America or in Australia, etc.",0
"Seems like a lot is missing from this article, especially the part about the atom bomb.
Here's a few reviews from Amazon.com:

A fiercely nationalistic book every American should read, August 5, 2002 

This book was a million-seller in Japan, and was translated into English in 1991. The author was a promininet Japanese politician. The book is dated, and history has not always borne out the author's views. Nonetheless, anyone attempting to understand modern Japan should read it. Some of the passages will be very surprising and disturbing. 
Author Ishihara avoids the conventionally polite Japanese protocol and forcefully states that Japan is the equal of the United States, that Japan should have its own defense forces, (and strong ones), that Japanese computer technology is second to none and should be used as a negotiating tool, and Japan will be the most influential power in dealing with Asian nations. 

Ishihara berates America for racism, and contends that the atomic bomb was not used on Germany because Germans were white, and Japanese were yellow. He asserts that nations colonized by Japan have been far more successful following liberation than those colonized by the United States. 

The book exemplifies the growing trend toward national pride in Japan, and also forcefully addresses the feeling by many Japanese that their nation is misunderstood. 

Plainly, the sentiments in the book foretell a troubled period in Japanese-American relations, and remind us that the Japanese have not forgotten Hiroshima any more than America has forgotten Pearl Harbor. Ishihara's call for a constructive dialogue between the two nations is well taken. Otherwise, the future looks cloudy at best. 

Very highly recommended, even if slightly dated. 

emblematic parochialism and obscure nationalist rage, September 19, 2006   

I read this book in the CIA-translated version as a Senate aide concerned about the rise of Japan, which included as co-author one of the leaders of Sony (Morita). While interesting for scholars, as I glanced thru this version - which is watered down but still white hot with anger - I was struck at how far off base the predictions of the man seem today. Afterall, when it was written, Japan was at the crest of the bubble economy, it appeared as if Japanese computer chips (and its electronic industries) would confer great power on the country (they could refuse to sell components that went into US missiles), and the US was in a now-unimaginable phase of self doubt. As such, the way things have turned out, after nearly 16 years of stagnation and the rise of high tech manufacturer-competitors elsewhere, reveal the author to have been so badly mistaken regarding the trajectory that Japan would take as to be laughable. 

In a deeper sense, it points to the fact that Ishihara did not understand the economic forces at work at the time and so was full of utterly baseless nationalistic bravado. Japan's economic rise was based upon the post-war reconstruction boom, then a relatively protected economy that allowed huge undustrial combines to band together as cartels (gouging their won consumers to sell at low prices abroad to gain marketshare and crush competitiors), and lastly to a number of significant management innovations (TQM, just-in-time manufacturing, etc.) that are reflected in the fact that they make excellent cars. However, it was basically a follower economy making products that have become commoditized by cheaper manufacturers elsewhere in Asia - just as its innovations became widely emulated - and corrupted by the money generated in real estate speculation that eventually collapsed in a deflationary spiral. Meanwhile, its political reforms have been weak at best, and senselessly nationalistic at worst. 

Ishihara understood none of this and casts no light on any of it of value. Instead, he drags out pre-WWII arguments about the innate superiority of the Japanese character and similar rather ugly arguments. He is also appalingly loose with the facts: for example, he claims that the US bombed Japan, but not Germany with the atom bomb for racist reasons (Japanese were yellow, Germans were not) - but if you know a minimum of history, which Isihara apparently doesn't, you would realise that at the time of the German defeat (April, 1945) the bomb was not yet completed (it was first test detonated the following July)! The book is full of this kind of sloppiness. What he does succeed at, however, is expressing the resentment that parochial Japanese nationalists felt at the time. In retrospect, his arrogance appears as breathtaking as it is ignorant. But his anger and resentment, and what they reflect of Japanese attitudes, is very real indeed. Seen this way, the book is one long crypto-racist rant.

Hi, I've mentioned the copyright problems here. Any help you can give in removing material that you know you've copy-pasted, and then noting that it's been removed, would be appreciated.  (talk) 
I doubt anyone would want you to quit (I know I don't!), but it is very important that you respect copyrights.  IMHO, nothing is a bigger threat to the continued success of Wikipedia than copyvios.  The potential for the foundation to get sued is far bigger than it is for libel by far.  I have been screamed at, told off and generally put in my place dozens of time since I have been here and fully expect that I will again, many times.  It would be really nice if everyone here was kind and respectful, but, just like society in general, that just isn't the case.  My suggestion to you is to ask questions, get help when you need it, make friends and continue to work on articles you like.  The best thing I did after I got here was to get adopted.  There is no textbook for this, and adoption provides you with a teacher that will walk you through the ropes, and be around after you graduate to mentor you.  Another great thing here is the Teahouse.  It is a place especially for newer users to ask questions and get answers without attitude.  My dad always used to say that the only stupid question was the one you didn't ask, and the Teahouse definitively follows that credo.  I will leave you an invite after this message.

"""Please read the following article carefully in order to understand the real world-wide recognised history 
- As somebody else said, the """"nation of Transylvania"""" DOES NOT EXIST, it is pure ROMANIA and Romanians! Therefore, we will tell some real history here. Within the chronicles of Herodotus , one may find that he described the Dacians(Getae) as the nation living within the present Romanian and Moldavian territory, including the part that is called Transylvania today, which means “beyond the forests”, after the Latin definition given by Romans and which consisted of the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Plains. A more accountable map can be found here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Dacia_82_BC.png .. Therefore, the nation living there consisted of dacians, which were known as Geton (plural Getae) in Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) and Getae in Roman documents. The dacians were conquered, after great efforts, by the Romans and Dacia was transformed into a Roman Province. Following, it was  a period of Romanization, period when the main Romanian people rose. As an answer to the Magyar origin, the history says that their starting point within the actual Hungary is related to the invasion of the Mongols ruled by Genghis Han and the Huns ruled by Attila within the European territory. After their settlement within the Pannonian Plains, the Hungarian people emerged, by mixing with the local populations. As a clear conclusion, one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of Dacians and the territory within they lived, called today Transilvania/Transylvania. The truth that has to be admitted is that Dacians/Getae were here as a nation BEFORE the Hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality. Moreover, NEITHER the Mongols and Huns NOR the actual Hungarians WERE here BEFORE the Romanization of Dacians, therefore they were not present before the emerging stage of the Romanian people. International history admits that the Hungarians appeared within today’s Hungary territory around the 9th century A.C. (according to Britannica) as an immigrating people coming from the actual Tibet region/Mongolia. After settlement they conquered Transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land. Bear in mind that Romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin, dating from Daco-Romans times and they will never stop viewing Trasilvania as their own home! If the Hungarians want to live without conflicts, they should stop claiming what does not belong to them, the Transylvania land. PEACE!

    Hi Wally, not sure if you are picking things up on my talk page, so talking with you here.

Thanks for your rapid response.  Proper thanks given on my talk page where you left feedback.

The User Astrotrain is still vandalising my work.  To try and shake him off my tail I have given him notice that he is violating Trade Marks, the word Astrotrain is a Trade Mark of Katara in Japan, but that user still persists in attacking my work using that illegal user name.  

I think agreement has been reached with other users by removing all personal links from my image pages pending a decision from Wikipedia image licencing specialists and you as a mediator even though I have not mentioned your user name.  One user ALR has been very good in tidying up the presentation of one of my images, after initally attacking me.

But Astrotrain is just deleting my work anyway. I do not know how to proceed with recommending the blocking of Astrotrain but that user is violating international law on the use of Trade Marks and possibly exposing Wikipedia to legal action from Katara's lawers. Astrotrain needs to be blocked for legal reasons, but it would probably also be useful for that user to go through the process of starting again. That user has a documented history of destroying other peoples work and holding back the development of Wikipedia on several articles there is a need for that user to re-evaluate its contribution to Wikipedia and personal agenda.  I wish Astrotrain well with a new user name.

Anyway. It occurs to me that there must be thousands of photographers in the world, many-many much more competent than me, who would be willing to release their prized pictures to Wikipedia for free Wikipedia use only.  Much of the world is lacking in education and information. The world's poorest only hope in the short term is """"technology leap"""" e.g. skipping the benefit of a free national press and going straight to the Internet with Wikipedia being a prime source of unbiased information. But not making pictures and information available from the professionals ensures that third world countries will only get second rate information, this will not help them. And on the contrary could be counterproductive to their development by holding back information.  Photographers often appear an arrogant breed, but deep down they are artists; caring people.  Perhaps Wikipedia should be calling on photographers around the world to make their contribution to the eradication of starvation and improved standards of living through education and Wikipedia. Hopefully this is not just soapbox but a constructive suggestion that can be the seed of something useful.  Des  """,0

To Argyriou,
I have noticed your action regarding my contribution.

Let me add few comments:
- English is not my primary language, so it is possible that a meaning very clear to me sounds or understood differently to an English speaking born. 

- A page about cooperative should contain, IMHO, a complete information about cooperatives and cooperative movement worldwide. The page now is limited to the official ICA approach, which is not the only one. I may say that this approach prove to be a failure in many parts of the world.

- I have tried to present a another approach to cooperative, and an approach developed in Israel during tenth of years. I can't see a reason why this approach shouldn't be presented on the Wikipedia.
More than this: there are cooperatives in the world who have followed in one way or another this approach. More information can be found: http://www.coopgalor.com/realization.html
A very successful example in the U.S.A can be read here: http://www.coopgalor.com/realization/Oklahoma.html

- This approach is backed by papers published in different places, including ICA. These papers can be read at: http://www.coopgalor.com/i_publications.html#Whats_coop

The reason that people have started shunning Wikipedia is exactly attitudes like that to prevent a free flow of facts.  If someone had written that Bell left the deanship at Oregon Law School because he was going to be fired since he spend all the time lecturing away from the school, I could not understand that. But there are articles about his antisemitism.

2. The statement “This view was put forward by the second president of the Watchtower Joseph Franklin Rutherford” not only lacks verification, it is just plain false. Rutherford did not teach that blood per se was sacred, and he never condemned blood transfusion. 

3. The statement “Beginning in 1980, the medical use of certain products derived from blood became permissible” is not verified, and it is just plain false. Watchtower doctrine tolerated some products derived from blood as early as November of 1961, which was only ten months after blood transfusion became a shunning offence. 

4. The statement “there is evidence that some Jehovah's Witnesses have secretly taken medical products derived from blood or blood transfusions” is a patent misrepresentation. Verifiable source material demonstrates that some Jehovah’s Witnesses have also openly accepted blood transfusion! 

5. The statement, “The non-acceptance of blood products by groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses has caused many hospitals to offer bloodless medicine” is another horrible misconstruction. When it comes to the Watchtower organization’s blood doctrine, there is no other similar group, and you have not referenced one either. 

Your statement manifests a serious lack of qualification to address this subject. You manifest ignorance of the subject, and a willingness to edit despite that lack. Hence I have reverted to the verified introduction, which feeds nicely into the article as a whole.

Squeaky here
Hi, thanks for the note you left me regarding my article on Bridget Taylor. A few points if I may. I'm new to this so I'm not really good at. I don't think you hate me and I see how much obviously better the article is with your edits. So I'm actually grateful. You are really good at this, I'm not but I'd like to learn. So seeing the changes that you made to my original, I can't help but agree they improved the article, every one of them. So no complaints here.You have my thanks. Just to clear up a couple of kind of misconceptions. I really had no agenda. I don't know Bridget Taylor, I wasn't promoting her in the sense of I think she needs to be promoted. If I was promoting her it's more because I have become a huge user of wikipedia myself. It's become the first place I go to research any subject, person, place or thing. Given that, I totally respect the fact you are such a great editor. As a user of the information provided here, I also hope that the subject matter is comprehensive, fact filled, current, and factual. So again, I am not offended by the need for editing; rather I welcome it. Getting back to my agenda. I became aware of Bridget Taylor through a child with autism and did some research on her background. I found that she is widely considered to be the leading expert practicing the use of ABA therapy and that she is truly a tireless advocate for autistic children and adults. My sole agenda honestly was not to promote her but to have her listed in wikipedia. When the parents of child get the dreaded diagnosis of autism, they tend to search for everything and anything in their power to help their child. I've learned in my research that Taylor 's work and practice are of the utmost importance, especially to the parents of very young children first diagnosed. The Alpine Learning Group is arguably (but not many would argue the point) the best placement for an autistic child in the country. So given what I had learned from my research I just thought it was very important to growing segment of the population that Taylor just be listed in wikipedia. Honestly, I'm without agenda. In fact, I'm not a """"fan"""" of ABA therapy. It is, however, the only scientific method proven to help autisic children learn. Which is a valuable thing. A parent can use dietary supplements, adjunct therapies, etc. which I totally support. In the meantime while waiting to see the results, there is a small window of opportunity when a child's brain is still pliable and they are at their peak learning age. That window goes from maybe 3-6 years old. So, to me, it seems very important to use what we have available (ABA therapy) so that child, all autistic children make the strides they are able to make in lear",0

 Conditioning? 
 Introduction
The emergence of reputation systems
How do we identify what is good? And how do we censure what is bad? We will argue that developing a humane reputation system ecology can provide better answers to these two general questions — restraining the baser side of human nature, while liberating the human spirit to reach for ever higher goals.

Most social interactions require matching human needs on the one hand, and quality or taste on the other hand: hunting for a reliable mechanic, looking for an interesting book, sifting through potential investments, judging the merits of proposed policies. Drawing from a distributed pool of reputations has the potential to ease the search for opportunities, ideas, friendships, cultural goods, and high–quality services; hand in hand, pressure will increase for honest behavior, competence, and fulfilling subtle human needs. At the same time, more efficient tagging of con artists, sources of spam, untrue claims, and dishonest actions can better sanction antisocial behavior, for the most part in a bottom–up """"distributed court of opinion.""""

Sustained rapid advances in information technology have created unprecedented abilities, which come along with unprecedented dilemmas. Data has never been easier to create and move around, but to make decisions one also needs to understand its context and implications. Just as important is what lies behind its face value, in realms such as speculative bubbles (Chancellor, 2000), shady financial practices (Partnoy, 2004), and the political statements that are the topic of much of our public discourse.

Access has generally become easier, driven by falling production, communication, and search costs; however, there are consequently far more suggestions, demands, and events to consider, straining our individual information processing capacity. Leaving the computational milieu alone to evolve """"naturally"""" is no guarantee that an ideal or even acceptable society–wide information infrastructure will emerge, as Brin (1999), Lessig (2001), Norman (1994), Schenk (1998), Stallman (2002), Walker (2003), and others have warned. To promote an interconnected ecology of socially beneficial reputation systems, conscious design, analytical modeling, and learning from past successes and failures is indispensable.

Filtering tools are still in their infancy — and having a better window to look out at the world can also imply that others can more easily peek in. Search engines speed up finding similar work done elsewhere; collaboration tools from humble mailing lists to community software to advanced groupware aid both individual and collective problem–solving. Yet it seems that for many important issues, all these tools are not keeping up with the increasing scale and number of decisions we must make, leading to what (Homer–Dixon, 2002) has referred to as an """"ingenuity gap.""""

Sheer computation power is not enough — another factor of 1000 in speed, storage, or bandwidth translates to a more modest gain in making better decisions, and perhaps even a net loss in other forms of effectiveness. (Indeed, if the data or assumptions are noisy enough, the programming aphorism of """"Garbage In, Garbage Out"""" applies.) Those who seek to use technology or the public space of ideas to advance their own agendas can also leverage increased computation power. There is indeed a technological revolution still in progress, reshaping commercial and social interactions — but its ultimate course will be affected by designers, activists, researchers and civil society at large. As (Fischer, 2002) said:

""""Peter Drucker argued that """"there is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all."""" Adding new media and new technologies to existing practices will not change the consumer mindsets of learners and workers. We need to explore new computational media based on fundamental aspects of how we think, create, work, learn, and collaborate ... New tools should not only help people to do known cognitive tasks more easily, but they should lead to fundamental alterations in the way problems are solved.""""
In order for computational advances to translate to widespread social advances, the tools must confer the ability to """"think smarter, not harder"""" — and use our collective evaluations of what is desirable to steer resources away from unproductive negative–sum games. Human brains provide an analogy: the difference between a moron and a genius lies primarily not in more or faster neurons, but in neurons that are wired together more effectively. In the same way, reputation systems are a generic tool that allow our observations, analysis, and actions to be """"wired together"""" more efficiently.

 Photo redux 

OK, now we have yet another new photo - the one of Michelle waving on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. I like it,  think it is a good photo - and until we have an official portrait I'd go with this one. But rather than repeatedly changing the picture can we discuss here from now on and try to come to consensus on any alternatives?  I also corrected the caption field so that a caption will appear. /talk 
As I said before, the photo is a good one of Michelle, but it needs to be cropped. The man in the background needs to go.

A few claims are made in that paper which fail to understand where hydrinos apply or do not apply. For example:
""""The higher temperatures in the electrode regions of high pressure hydrogen discharge plasmas would overcome significant activation energies for the proposed hydrino formation reactions. There are no reports of high pressure hydrogen plasmas collapsing into hydrinos with a burst of hard ultraviolet radiation and X-rays."""" They, the authors of this response to Mills' work, do not account for the catalysts needed to make the hydrino transitions possible. Indeed, the word """"catalyst"""" fails to appear even one time in this response to Mills' work. They do not account for the fact that sun produces massive amounts of hard ultraviolet radiation and x-rays by multiple means, and these are not necessarily all identified. They do not make note of the claim that hydrinos cannot be observed without knowing where the emissions of their formation should peak in the sun's electromagnetic spectrum. Indeed, the word """"peak"""" fails to appear even one time in this response to Mills' work.
""""If hydrinos existed, their LTE density in the photosphere would be vastly higher than the density of ordinary hydrogen.""""

 I am completely convinced now! You are most certainly a paid propagandist who's sole goal on wikipedia is the integral protection of Yugoslavs and Yugoslav historiography. Hilariously enough, one needs to spend years studying the complexity of NDH in order to get the correct picture - what you do not have and will never have because of your balkan irrationality and politically fueled interest in such a topic and the surrounding topics. I really do wish I had the time and energy to flip this all around, site sources - and become more familiar with wikipedia itself - but I do not. I have trumped you in almost every single section of argument - point for point. But you still continue and you have even removed things that I have written on discussion pages within long periods of time where I am not visibly present. I would probably do the same if someone like myself was embarrassing me intellectually in the way that I embarrass you. Stipe Mesic used NDH rhetoric several times in several countries to benefit his and the HDZ's political platform. If you are going to sit here and say that the memory of NDH had nothing to do with the creation of the modern Croatian state - well then you're lying to yourself and everyone else. The entire political emigration was founded upon the tradition of NDH. The modern wave of Croatian nationalism was the idea of national reconciliation between sons of Ustase and Partizani. That's in HDZ's original political platform. Tudman had to appeal to all Croatians - that's why you Tito lovers got to parade around with the false idea of antifascism at a time when the Croatian lobby couldn't combat 60 years of communist propaganda and the Serb wartime propaganda machine that was screaming - Tudman = Pavelic, look at the flag, look at the currency! I personally witnessed Stipe Mesic playing the NDH card. He is an opportunist. He was even caught singing """"Jure i Boban"""". Coincidence ?  Of course not. It was to his political benefit. He also left Tudman's side to shake hands with Croatia's political right in their smear campaign against Tudman himself. That's right, Stipe Mesic at HSP rallies years before Anto Djapic and the HSP denounced the Ustasa Movement or Dr. Pavelic. Look at Djapic now... There's another great example. 15 years ago he was Ustasa number one. In recent years, European pressure has made it unfavorable - so now he sings a different tune. That's the best part. All these people are the biggest balkan chameleons who use these catch themes to fool all the little balkanites into ignoring real problems in the country. That is how NDH is relevant. However, your side has done so well in the creation of this so-called antifascism, that 'pro-NDHers' if you will can only 'fight back' by pointing out communist crimes. Jasenovac Vs Bleiburg isn't really Jasenovac Vs Bleiburg, its Ustasa historiography Vs Partizan historiography. Most people in Croatia sympathize with one side or the other - you know that, and I know that. You can sit here and throw out fallacies, fact is fact, Stipe Mesic at one point in time glorified the tenth of April and sang Ustasa songs. That is a fact. Dr. Pavelic was allied with the Axis, that is a fact. He later in his emigre days distanced himself and his movement from the Nazis and formed a Croatian Democratic movement (HOP).

In the introduction: """"Henry, previously seen by many in the sport as a fair footballer, was labelled by many in the aftermath as a cheat[2]""""
This needs an additional citation for the first part ([2] only refers to him now being labelled a cheat). Henry has never been a fair footballer, the match has just brought to light the foul play he has ALWAYS used to get an upper hand (even the biased french and arsenal fans realise). Furthermore, the quote by Wenger that """"he is one of the fairest players I have managed"""" holds no weight since:

1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years.

2) It is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at Arsenal so saying Henry is one of the fairest isn't saying much.

Depardieu is a French actor having his legal residence in Belgium. That's all for the moment

1. France did not remove Depardieu's citizenship yet (otherwise, where is the source?).

2. Depardieu never applied for Russian citizenship.

3. Ask your Prof. of International Law (I did).

4. See here: http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/filmstar-gerard-depardieu-von-putin-zum-russen-ernannt-a-875537.html): “Die Formulierung des Kreml, wonach Depardieu einen Antrag auf Einbürgerung gestellt hatte, wurde von einem Assistenten des Schauspielers dementiert.“

In English: The formulation of the Kremlin, that Depardieu had filed an application for naturalization, was denied by an assistant of the actor.

So yes: the Kremlin lied.

5. Lock this article once and for all for the rest of the month.

6. Ask yourself: If tomorrow, every country of the world offer Depardieu a passport, what do you do?

Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament). That means in fact that the Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to behave like a very true Christian by loving his enemies although they themselves failed even in loving just their neighbours (the Jews) in the past before.""""

"Cabalist team of sysops/users undermines WP’s reliability  promoting Greek nationalistic POV 
A well collaborated group of 2 WP sysops and 8 WP users has been spotted working systematically in full daily basis to promote ultra natioanalistic Greek POV. They intervene in any related  new articles, make Greek POV edits, edit wars, reverts, deletions, block users, merges and redirects. Their main target is political articles about Rebublic of Macedonia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania, their minorities in Greece and Greek history. 

Khoikhoi (sysop) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (sysop)  recently deleted article: Voden inscription, and protected articles as Minorities in Greece and Bulgarian Human Rights in Macedonia. They also redirected new articles as  Bulgarian minority in Greece to Minorities of Greece, Bulgarians in Greece to Minorities in Greece and Tarlis incident  to Treaty of Sevres without warning and discussion. 

All  redirects don’t  allow traces . Practically this action is equivalent to speady deletion because redirected articles are not included to target articles and  prevents recreating them under same name.

Hmmm. I was actually writing a response as you sent yours. Oh well. For the record, my response was this:

Resurrecting articles is frowned upon, yes. We might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one, however - though of course we both know that there's no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did - there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. Changing the name would be nice but I'm not sure what we would change to...the game didn't really have a """"name"""" like the Ballet on Ice or any such, and there are limited other ways of naming the article.

Making this subpage was a decent idea, you just got unlucky in that it's something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. Honestly I can say I've never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so I have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a community-wide shrugging of the shoulders. Certainly there's been no AfD nomination yet, which is a start. I have to say I somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article (i.e. not keeping the subpage) but I don't have strong feelings so I'll run with whatever works. If it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like Category:Football matches (I have no idea if that exists, it was another example) and Category:FA Cup and then probably into a new category for City matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. That category would then have to be categorised so it wasn't just an orphan. I don't know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but I suspect it's not encouraged, so that idea might be rejected if (whoever did it) couldn't find more like-minded articles to categorise into the same. I don't think it being categorised would really affect anyone's opinion of the article though. The one thing that might affect peoples' judgement right now is that it will (in its present form) show up in categories as """"2003–04 Manchester City F.C. season/Spurs 3-4 City"""" or however the subpage is actually named, given the / in the name.

Yes, I'd say it will currently be located in an overarching """"please categorise these pages"""" category. I don't know how long it would take for it to get sorted, but it would probably be put somewhere generic. Better to do it ourselves, I guess.

Sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but I was answering the points as they came and...well, better English just didn't quite flow from my fingers as I typed. Hopefully I addressed all your points. I'll settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it, though I think that page would be best served by being redone - with as many citations as possible - and expanded upon, so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society, so to speak. Having an article AfD'ed isn't a permanent sign that that article should never exist, it's merely a suggestion that it shouldn't exist in the state it's in. Generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.

As for the Charity Shield, I always considered it a notable trophy. Yes, it's a single game, but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place (ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play). To this end, I'd consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. Similarly, would you question the worthiness of the European Super Cup? In fact, because some teams initially didn't enter, City were instrumental in making the Charity Shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. You could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it, we should be the ones most ardently defending it.  Talk """,0

the or The? (re-stated proposal)
It seems that there is some confusion as to what is being proposed, with some editors believing the statement “the band’s name is The Beatles” to be a counter-argument to the proposal (in fact, the statement is a premise of the proposal), so I’ll try to re-present the argument more clearly.

Premises:
The band’s name is The Beatles.
The band’s name is not subject to any unusual capitalisation rules. (Were it otherwise, there would be WP:RSs commenting on the fact).
The band’s name is used in Wikipedia music articles.
MOS:MUSIC is “the Manual of Style, a style guide, for Wikipedia music articles”.
MOS:MUSIC#Names (definite article) instructs that, for band names starting with the definite article, “Mid-sentence, per the MoS, the word """"the"""" should in general not be capitalized” (and provides for exception, only on a usage basis, not a band basis).

Conclusion:
When the name The Beatles is used in Wikipedia music articles, the word the should not be capitalized mid sentence (excepting the specific constructs detailed in MOS:MUSIC).

Proposal:
Follow the MOS (per the above conclusion).

Notes:
The benefit in accepting the proposal is, per the MOS, more “consistent usage and formatting”, throughout music articles and Wikipedia as a whole.
Per WP:CCC, “editors need to re-examine each proposal on its own merits”, not “on what influenced a past consensus”.

 Phallocrypt or necklace? 
(Copied from Wikipedia:Reference desk/Humanities.)

Read about the koteka and lonkalonka on WIKIPEDIA. The description of the lonkalonka as a phallocrypt hung from male genitalia seems very peculiar, as I have seen an image of one with a twisted thong made of human hair. But to me it seems more like a necklace or ornament for the upper arm, as the thong is too short to get around the waist, and how it could be hung from the genitalia and called a phallocrypt, is beyond me. I have never seen pictures of aborigines wearing these lonka lonkas, so how do you know this is a phallocrypt? Someone who can explain how they are fixed to the body or lead me to an image so I am no more in doubt...
Are there pictures anywhere of the ornaments of jade and hardstone hung from the genitalia in South America, in other words, is this a fact? Nothing surprise me  about garments, but seeing is believing... 
The koteka, on the other hand , has got an historian/entropologist  to suggest that they could have been worn by people here in Scandinavia during the bronze age due to the many rock carvings of males with axes and phallos. And why not..?
Thank you.

The information you refer to was added by an anonymous editor who apparently could himself use some editing . . .

This is a marketing decision made by inhabitants of this province.  Look, I'll be the first to agree that both South Tyrol and Alto Adige are used in English,  it is really about 50/50 (especially in the UK).  In the US it is almost completely Alto Adige (because our interaction with Bolzano is mostly thru agriculture).  Here are some examples of Alto Adige being used  and .  Yes, the German speakers can make similar arguments for South Tyrol usage, and we can go on and on and on.  That is why the original compromise was made, to use Alto Adige and South Tyrol in the lead paragraph, and use the Province of X location (as is done for every other province of Italy on Wikipedia) for the article.  But, some German speaking editors could never accept this, and want this article to match the German Wikipedia article, Sudtirol.  Ever wonder why they constantly remove Alto Adige from bold face and any statement recognizing its use in English?  Anyway, I really hate to even participate in this nonsense anymore, but this move request is nothing less than abuse of Wikipedia (but, hey, what's new).

 With this work, the authors, Mayoury and Pheuiphanh Ngaosyvathn, offer us a wealth of information on the history of a small kingdom, the Lao, centered at Vientiane, in modern Laos, caught between expanding core states (Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam) in the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth century. The authors draw upon a wide literature and an impressive range of languages to present a clear and careful picture of a very complex period in Lao and Southeast Asian history.

This book is really the story of Chou Anou, the last of the Lao kings of Vientiane and his struggle against rivals on all sides. Chou Anou played a political game between the expansionist Thai and Vietnamese states in the late eighteenth and ear]y nineteenth centuries, a game that his kingdom eventually lost. Because of the Tay Son, Vietnam was out of the picture for decades; the central Thai court was Chou Anou's chief antagonist. When Vietnam does enter the picture again under Minh Mang, it is as a supporter of Chou Anou, in the context of a larger Thai-Vietnamese competitive hostility. Fighting between Thailand and Vientiane appears on an extremely personal level in the text — the authors stressing at one point Rama III's anxiety that a massacre of Vietnamese emissaries and Lao guides by a Thai officer had not left enough dead, considering an earlier massacre of Thai by Chou Anou in Vientiane (p. 242); they stress also the personal nature of the fighting between Chou Anou and the Thai general Bodin. Further, the text seems almost to replicate, anachronistically, aspects of war more endemic to the post-World-War II conflicts in Indochina, including a reference to """"sophisticated Siamese psychological operations"""" (p. 212).

Paths to Conflagration is organized into nine chapters, each covering a different episode of the period, examined step-by-step, and turns from one incarnation of Vientiane to another — from victim to provocateur to buffer state. Each page is heavy with documentation, but the narrative is lighter. This book has three real strengths. First, it discusses history at the point of intersection between three different polities and does not apply the nation-state """"cookie-cutter"""" approach — looking only at developments as they relate to a state-centered narrative (thus framed by political borders). Instead of the history of Laos, we find here the history of a very turbulent period in which political borders did not mean very much in delineating the boundaries of action. Second, this book makes use of a very wide range of sources, especially from the Thai archives, spanning a large number of languages (including Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, French, English, and German — both primary sources and secondary literature) and a multitude of perspectives. Third, this book focuses attention on developments sometimes left out of analyses of mainland Southeast Asian history, such as the all-important impact of migration, especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is no mistake that migration is referred to over and over again in chronicles of the period, from western Burma to Vietnam, and that migration is used as metaphor for political change and state reformation for far earlier periods in these chronicles. Here too, migration played a very important role, as the authors stress both migration into the Lao kingdom, and forcible expulsion by the Thais, as a basis for the well-being and even survival of the Vientiane-based state.

"possible problems  

I want to point out a few possible problems with some specific sections or topics, esp pertaining to 'no citations':

no citation, npov: The system is still encountering strain and financial constraints, some say more than ever. And what is the point of the sentence anyways?
Healthcare
The Campbell government inherited a health care system that was encountering strain and financial constraints upon assuming office.

No citation: It also has an issue that he campaigned on NO cuts to government workers, hospital workers, etc, in fact, when accused by the NDP of his going to have to make large cuts and layoffs, he fired back that the NDP was fear mongering:
[edit] Income tax reductions
In 2001, Campbell campaigned on a promise to significantly reduce income taxes. A day after taking office, Campbell reduced personal income tax for all taxpayers by 25 per cent over two years. Cuts were applied to every tax bracket; the tax rate on the first $30,000 of income was cut by 2 points from 8.4% to 6.05%, while the top tax rate for income over $85,000 was cut by 5 points from 19.7% to 14.7%.

No citation:
Education
While funding was increased to record levels during the Campbell government’s first term in office, challenges remained in K-12 education.

Again, no citation. Campbell might have been in favour, but it was started by the NDP, as many pundints are quick to point out when hospital closures are compared against the cost of new luge track.
2010 Olympics
British Columbia won the right to host the 2010 Winter Olympics on July 2nd, 2003. This was a joint Winter Olympics bid by Vancouver and the ski resort of Whistler. [18].
Campbell, a main proponent of the bid to get the games, attended the final presentations in Prague, Czech Republic and made an impassioned plea for the games to come back to Canada for the first time since it was held in Calgary in 1988.

This is only a quick look. I would appreciate some feedback before changes are made.
As I have pointed out earlier, a great deal of this article reads like a press release. If you compare this premier with any other, there will be a world of difference. 

Perhaps it should be scaled back to the bare minimum bio, and everything else gets chucked into the appropriate spot.

Oh Mark, for shame! Why lie? I didn't get banned from the Clitoris article for any such thing. I didn't get banned from it at all. I was banned from removing the picture that upset several editors. You pretended you had a """"unanimous"""" """"consensus"""" then too. I didn't constantly run any polls. That's a downright lie too. Why would I? I don't think polls demonstrate consensus and I oppose their use to settle content disputes. I've expressed that view many, many times. The dispute on clitoris in fact centred around a group of editors who were bullying minority-view editors because they had won a vote. They largely refused to discuss the salient issues because, they believed, they had won a vote and that was that. (Careful Tony Sidaway watchers will note that on Talk:Clitoris he was insistent that winning a vote was the same as having a consensus but on Talk:something about B roads, he had changed his tune and thought that votes were evil. Like most of the people who voted here, it's one rule when it fits your POV, another when it doesn't.) This title is shockingly POV. That you can line up a bunch of editors who share the POV that it pushes to vote and say no it's not doesn't actually not make it so, but I've given up trying to get editors to accept that the proZionist stance that is so common in your home country is not actually """"neutral"""".

In the 1990s, of course, these texts were widely interpreted as describing a conflict between Tikal and Uaxactun; this is still reflected on the current version of the Uaxactun page.",0

David Ernest Duke (born July 1, 1950) is a former Louisiana State Representative and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

He has made a number of unsuccessful political bids for higher office, including run for the Louisiana State House, Louisiana State Senate, United States Senate, United States House, governor of Louisiana and twice for president of the United States. In 2002 he pled guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges. He is a long-time New Orleans resident and the proud father of Erika and Kristin Duke. 

Youth & Early Adulthood, the Klan and first campaigns

David Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. & Maxine Duke. As a Shell Oil engineer his fathers frequently moved his wife, David, and his sister Dotti to numerious locations around the world. The Duke's spent a short period of living in the Netherlands before they settled in Louisiana. Young David became interested in the white nationalist movement at an early age and joined the Klan in 1967. Duke went on to study at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1970, he formed a caucasian campus-group known as the White Youth Alliance. That same year, he made himself known even more by demonstrating in swastika regalia to protest William Kunstler's appearance at Tulane University, LA. He was involved in the campus ROTC, until he was kicked out due to his radical beliefs. In 1971, he went to Laos to teach English to Laotian military officers and serve on cargo flights for Air America over the course of ten weeks.

Duke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became notorious on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform, Ku Klux Klan apparel, and swastika paraphernalia while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he was elected Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He attracted attention for trying to modernize the Klan and turn it into a modern nationalist political force. For example, he changed the title of 'Grand Wizard' to 'National Director' and sported a conservative suit as opposed to the traditional white robe. 

In 1976, Duke sought a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat. In 1978, he left the Klan and two years later formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). In 1987, he conducted a direct-mail appeal using the identity and mailing-list of the Forsyth County Defense League, in Georgia, without permission, which League officials described as a fund-raising """"scam"""" (detailed in The Rise of David Duke by Tyler Bridges). In 1988, he ran in the Democratic Party primary for President of the United States. After a dismal showing in the Democratic primaries, he appeared on many state ballots as the nominee of the Populist Party and received  approximately 25,000 votes in the 1988 general election.

Using the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt, Dr. Duke published a self-help book for women titled Finders-Keepers in 1976. The publication gives advice to women regarding vaginal exercises, fellatio, anal sex, and anilingus .  The manual is no longer in print and hard to find, however “The Picayune”, a local Mississippi newspaper, managed to find a copy and trace the trail of it’s proceeds to the original  author via the publisher.

In the 1980s, he was heavily involved in gambling and stock market investments, which were covered by the Times-Picayune, as well as by others. Columbia Journalism Review, THE PICAYUNE CATCHES UP WITH DAVID DUKE Attitudes of Mississippi college students toward David Duke before and after seeing the film 'Who Is David Duke?' The Nation, Republicanizing the Race Card

In the latter years of the 1980s, Duke sought to revamp his appearance by undergoing plastic surgery, and also shaved off his moustache following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives.

In 1984 David Duke and wife Chloe Hardin were divorced. Hardin then moved to West Palm Beach, Florida to be closer to her family. There she became involved with Duke’s childhood friend, Don Black, whom she married several years later. [http://www",0

"REPLY: Many distributors say not to use chlorine bleach nor cationic sufactants (fabric relaxers, fabric conditioners).  

AIUI too high a concentration of bleach may distort the fibers [please confirm].  The cationic surfactant will fill the holes in the microfiber and reduce its efficiency.

Similarly microfiber should not be washed at too high temperatures (eg 80 celsius).  However it is hard to get microfiber to release the dirt it holds and so the method of washing needs to be a bit of a compromise.

Do not wash with other garments especially those which shed small particles of fiber as these will be taken in and held by the microfiber cloth.

There does not seem to be a case for using special detergents.

Again, some will advocate using a drier but the temperature must not be so high as to distort the micro fibers.  I would not want to iron or press washed microfiber because of the possible loss of the dirt traps.

Some distributors will suggest the use of bleach (eg 3M and its Scotch-Brite microfiber kitchen cloths) and others will specify rather high temperatures.  Perhaps their microfibers have been treated or manufactured to withstand such washing but I am not sure how it could have been achieved.

Looking at the editing Histories of Goethena/Propol
For the interested parties that are watching this talk page and article, it would 
be useful to look at the nature and tone of edits which  and 
 have done in the last few weeks and judge the loving kindness they
impart on the Duckworth article, vers the near libelous editing on the Roskam article.

This just pointing out """"facts"""" and not in volition of WP:AGF in quoting that policy it says...

This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Actions inconsistent with good faith include vandalism, sockpuppetry, and lying. Assuming good faith also does not mean that no action by editors should be criticized, but instead that criticism should not be attributed to malice unless there is specific evidence of malice. Accusing the other side in a conflict of not assuming good faith, without showing reasonable supporting evidence, is another form of failing to assume good faith.

So, any honest hearted admin, in light of the John Seigenthaler, Sr Debacle, will not
surely not allow the kind of bias editing that now taking place.  So, in the mean time, and until there is some ruling tendered from higher athority, I will lovingly protect the Roskam article as   and  lovingly protect the Duckworth article from any, and all negative edits, even edits that are well cited, per wikipedia policy, I will do the same for the Roskam article.  

Again, I am willing for dialog with other editors regarding good faith edits, but the two editors which I have mentioned above, due again, to their well documented editing histories on the Duckworth and Roskam, I will revert most of what they put up unless those edits conform, IMHO, to Wikipolicy to WP:BLP  WP:NPOV  WP:NPOV#Undue weight.  and finely  WP:SENSE.

 Remove or change de link? 

The link to the german WP article Irrgarten might be misleading. The authors understand the article as purely garden-related, i.e. it only deals with botanical maze-like arrangements. Any reference to other representations (especially the mathematical stuff) seems to be very unwelcome there and are removed almost immediately. I have also doubts that """"irrgarten"""" is equivalent to """"maze"""". In german popular language, most people use the term """"labyrinth"""" that, in modern times, seems to be almost equivalent to """"maze"""".

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Reactions from San Diegans
After the format move to 570, many who live in the San Diego area had complained that they were unable to get the station's new signal, fueling the complaint that AM 570 had """"Los Angeles-ized"""", and no longer catered to San Diego's sports teams and listeners.

This also came to the attention of Premiere Radio Networks, Jim Rome's syndicator; XEPRS-AM, """"the Mighty 1090,"""" a rival radio station that broadcasts in San Diego and parts of Orange County and Los Angeles (and run by the Broadcast Company of the Americas, whose CEO John Lynch administered XTRA Sports Radio in San Diego from the mid 1980s to its merger with 1150 in 2002), picked up The Jim Rome Show in September 2005. 

As the radio flagship home of the Los Angeles Lakers, KLAC normally put much more emphasis and focus on the team, possibly very much to the chagrin of listeners who are not supporters of the Lakers.

Leejc is absolutely right. He did a better job expressing what I tried to say back in June, 2007. But while I agree with his final conclusion, it isn't quite the right argument to use, that """"we must assume the worst,"""" to get it. So I thought I would try once again to explain how the different wordings of this problem, that seem to say the same thing, can lead to different solutions.

The ultimate cause of confusion is the math-specific definition of the term """"event."""" When a random experiment produces a result, that result is not called an """"event,"""" it is an """"occurrence."""" """"Event"""" is defined to be the subset of all possible occurrences that have some defining common property. So if I flip a coin a hundred times, there are only two possible events: """"heads"""" and """"tails."""" There will most likely be about fifty occurrences of each event; and each occurrence will fit into only one event.

If I draw a card from a standard deck of playing cards, there are lots of possible events and/or occurrences. Some of them overlap. They include """"black card,"""" """"spade,"""" """"honor card (TJQKA),"""" """"Ace,"""" and """"Ace of Spades."""" The occurrence """"black card"""" can be in the event """"spade"""" or """"club"""" as well. Note that an occurrence can fit into other events, but not vice versa. An occurrence of """"spade"""" is also an occurrence of """"black card,"""" but the event """"spade"""" is most definitely not the event """"black card."""" Since determining probabilities involves counting the number of elements in events, the difference can be crucial when less specific observations are applied.

There is a famous problem that isolates this difference between an occurrence and an event. It is called Bertrand's Box Paradox Suppose you have three indistinguishable boxes, each with two indistinguishable drawers. Inside each drawer is a coin. Box #1 has two gold coins, Box #2 has two bronze coins (I can't resist the temptation to use the initials B and G), and Box #3 has one of each. You pick a box at random, and open a drawer at random. If the coin is gold, what are the odds that the coin in the box's other drawer is also gold (i.e., that it is Box #1)?

The first issue here, common to story problems, is that this problem describes an occurrence, not an event. We must extrapolate what the possible outcomes of the actions are, to define the event (the set of possible occurrences) that defines the conditional probability.

The incorrect approach to Bertrand's Box Paradox is to say that you narrowed the identity of the box to two possibilities, Box #1 and Box #3. That the """"event"""" matches the observation """"the box has at least one gold coin."""" This is wrong because there are other ways to describe occurrences in that event. If you pick box #3, then no matter which drawer you open, the occurrence is in the event """"the box has at least one gold coin.""""

The correct approach is to define the event as the set of all possible occurrences where you open a drawer with a gold coin. Every possible occurrence that is consistent with the problem description is in this event (remember, it's a set), and every possible element of this event is consistent with the problem description. Both of those conditions have to be true for the event set we extrapolate as the condition. This set has three elements, not two. In two of those three possible occurrences, the box's other coin is gold. The correct answer is 2/3.

I have seen a variation of Bertrand's Box Paradox used to represent the Boy or Girl Paradox. You are the organizer of a neighborhood swim meet. During the meet, you get a phone call from Mr. Smith, who is delayed and can't pick up his children after the meet. He says """"Tell my two kids to go home with a neighbor. Their names are Sarah and..."""" and the phone connection goes dead. There are four families of two children in the meet, and they conveniently include the four possibilities BB, BG, GB, and GG. What are the odds that Mr. Smith has two daughters?

This occurrence can be described as """"a two-child family includes at least one girl."""" But not the event you need to use as the condition. Mr. Smith could have mentioned a boy's name first; and if that boy had a sister, that occurrence would have been an element of the set """"a two-child family includes at least one girl."""" So that event fails one of the two criteria. You get the answer 1/3 by erroneously using this event.

The correct event is just that Mr. Smith mentioned that he had a daughter, and compares to """"you opened a drawer with a gold coin"""" in the Box Paradox. You can count four possible occurrences of that event. In two of those four, representing a single family, Sarah has a sister. The correct answer is 2/4, or 1/2.

If a conditional probability question describes an occurrence, and not an event, care needs to be taken whe",0

Hi RetroS1mone. Thanks for coming here to reply to Guido - it's no problem at all, especially when I'm not around. I replied to Guido above about the 3RR block. If Guido does take my advice to work on that table in his userspace, would you give him the time to marshall his arguments and listen to what he has to say? I know he does have COI with the activist organisation, but while strongly discouraged it is not forbidden to edit if you have a COI. See WP:COI and also Wikipedia:Suggestions for COI compliance. Me personally, I would prefer Guido edited chess articles and only participated on the talk pages of CFS/ME pages (or worked on the article about CFS activism that has been suggested). Oh, and you are quite right about the forum-shopping. Guido, if you have a complaint about conduct on those articles, you will need to find another admin and not come to my talk page. I've commented on the talk pages of some of these articles with suggestions about the content, and (for me) that makes me too involved as an editor to use my admin tools in relation to those articles. RetroS1mone, speaking as an editor and not an admin, I would advise you not to say things in edit summaries like """"tendentious editor with strong COI POV"""". The reason being that edit summaries are permanent records, and if you say something incorrect, you can't retract it. It is best to keep edit summaries focused on describing the content (not the editors) and then to say """"see talk"""" if you want to go into more detail. That way, if you are wrong, you can retract and apologise later. For the record, I think you are mostly right here (though I would have phrased it more diplomatically), but I hope you see my point about the difference between saying something in an edit summary and saying something on a talk page.

Well, let's try again (one more time).
Re """"""""commonsenual"""" = WP:OR. Regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation (Glantz et al.)"""" """"Commonsensual"""" is not OR. Occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete, and it is regulated by various international conventions. For instance, Guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation, and one of them refers to something quite unique. Therefore, we can speak about the """"occupation sensu stricto"""" and """"occupation following an armistice"""". That is what I mean under """"commonsensual"""" occupation, and that is how a reader will understand it.
Re belligerent occupation, I do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way; however, other sources (majority of sources) use different terminology. Therefore, the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. I propose to present both viewpoints - you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. Therefore, it is your arguments that do not hold water.
Re Malksoo, please, re-read his works again. And, since both you and I can draw different conclusions from different pieces of Malksoo's text, below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position, made specifically for us:
"""" The Baltic Sattes were occupied in June 1940 and annexed (incorporated) by the USSR in August 1940. Thus, both occupation and annexation DID happen. The fact of annexation - and that the USSR proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own, not occupied - changed the nature of the occupation, if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. For example, when 1980 Moscow olympic games took place, the olympic regatta took place in Tallinn. This cannot be a typical occupation situation.However, it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant Western opinion and post-1991 restored Baltic States themselves, the Soviet annexation remained illegal. In this sense, illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudo-debate. The annexation - since it remained illegal - did not create any extra rights to the annexing power, the USSR. If the article makes that aspect clear, I would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to """"Occupation and Annexation of the Baltic States"""". In fact, I would recommend such change because it takes more precisely (closer to the facts) into account the complex nature of the Soviet rule in the Baltic States.""""
What else do you need? Malksoo clearly says that in the case of the Baltic states both occupation and annexation took place, and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense (but not in others. P.S.) llegal annexation equals extended occupation. In other words, we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the Baltic states, and I never argued against that. Again, what synthesis you accuse me in?
Re """"there is no bridge between the Baltic and Soviet/official Russian positions; there is no in-between or continuum of scholarship, it's one or the other;"""" Wrong. There is a Baltic position, position of different foreign states (which was different from state to state and from time to time), positions of scholars (western, Baltic, Russian), Soviet positions (different during 1950s-70s and during Perestroika) and official Russian position.
Re """"From Glantz to Malksoo, a belligerent occupation."""" Glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the WWII, not in the legal aspects; Malskoo does not consider Soviet intervention in 1940 as a military operation at all. The only aggressive step, according to him, was a naval blockade.
Re """"Baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were """"colonized"""""""" Probably. However, other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the USSR, hence extensive influx of migrants. Was it possible if they had a colonial status?

"I have just followed from your edit exchange on the article Blu-Ray Disc to find the exchange above.  Sadly, you appear to know little about the subject, and to be fair, it has become confusing because much of the terminology has become abused.

First, European Blu-Ray discs are not produced in 24p format.   That is almost exclusively the preserve of the American regions.  Secondly, the Blu-Ray format does not support the proper 1080 progressive high definition formats (1080/50p and 1080/60p (and I include the 59.95p in that).  This is because the data rate is not fast enough for these formats.  The European sourced discs that state 1080p on the packaging are discs produced from film originated material and is one of the abuses of the term progressive.  The term progressive strictly defines a video format where the lines of video information are recorded in strict numerical order, 

1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ... 1078 - 1079 -1080.  

Alternatively, there is the interlaced format which displays the odd lines ony first (odd field) and then follows them by the even lines (even field). (You probably know this already).

1 - 3 - 5 - 7 ... 1077 - 1079 - 2 - 4 - 6 ... 1078 - 1080

They are actually stored in the digital video frame the other way around due to the digital video format's origins in the NTSC world.  In true video source material, the even field displays a time slice that is 20 milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame.  This is also largely true in the Americas, except the even field precedes the odd field by ~16.6 miliiseconds.

There is a largish group of enthusiasts (if that's the right word) who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go.  The reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it.  But for them, everything has to be progressive.  I shall coin the word 'progressivists' for this discussion.

When film originated material is transferred to video in Europe, the film is run slightly fast by 4% which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame (known as 2:2 pulldown).  Thus the even field displays a time slice that is 0 milliseconds later than the odd field.  In order to satisfy the progressivists, the Blu-Ray producers state that such material is in 1080p format, but using something called a 'Progressive Segmented Frame' technique (though they don't mention that last bit on the box).  That is: that it is progressive video, but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines.  It is really interlaced video, but by the time the display device or the Blu-ray player has de-interlaced the video (it doesn't matter one jot where it actually happens), the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true 1080/25p video (assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly).  If watched on a CRT display then, of course, the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display, but with that number of lines, no one is likely to notice (unless they sit inches away from the screen).  The description 1080p on the box is, technically at least, wrong but percetually the same as 1080/25p video.  The 4% speed up goes completely un-noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch - and obviously you hadn't noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed.

Once we cross to the Americas, different problems occur.  Obviously, running the film at 30 frames per second is not an option, so instead, film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on 3 half video frames, followed by storing the next frame on 2 half video frames and then repeating 3 - 2 - 3 - 2.  Thus 4 film frames occupy 5 video frames (the technique is 3:2 pulldown - often wrongly called 2:3 pulldown).  Properly deinterlaced, such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong.  But the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format.  I have even seen claims (obviously failing to understand the technique) that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps 50% further every other jump due to the 3 half fields.  

The result was the 24p format.  The only problem with the 24p format is that if you try to watch it on a CRT display (and A CRT is still unbeatable for contrast and colour reproduction), the result will be unviewable to bad flicker - something that was known as long ag",0

 Angels and Christian Angelic Hierarchy 

  Hey, you deleted my stuff because I didn't cite sources. But my claims were never """"scholars believe this"""" so I don't think I should have to cite anything. In """"Angel"""" I simply said that because of the ambiguity of the word angel it is possible that people are misinterpreting passages containing it.

  Along the same lines is my contribution to """"Christian Angelic Hierarchy"""". Simply read the Bible passage that I quoted. It clearly talks about Christians being against the """"powers, thrones and principalities."""" The whole chapter is talking about how Christians are to be against corrupt human authorities.

http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/climategate_how_the_cabal_controlled_wikipedia

One person in the nine-member Realclimate.org team — U.K. scientist and Green Party activist William Connolley — would take on particularly crucial duties.

Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.

All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.

"Abortion
One of the most difficult questions facing the right to life concerns the precise definition of the term ‘human life’- when exactly does ‘life’ begin and end? This controversial issue has its focus with the exact point of the commencement of human life. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it would be accorded the ‘right to life’ under the constitution. Thus, laws concerning abortion would effectively be rendered unconstitutional.

In Singapore, the Penal Code lays out the sanctions imposed if one does not comply with the Termination of Pregnancy Act- which limits abortion to patients who have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. In Malaysia, the Penal Code states that abortion is permissible within 120 days of conception, only if the pregnancy were to pose a threat to an expecting mother’s physical or mental health.  This shows that in these two jurisdictions, the states are unwilling to confer the ‘right to life’ to fetuses younger than the stipulated periods. The legislation there has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expecting mothers who are threatened by their unborn child, and made provisions for their survival.[FIND YOUR JOURNAL^^]

This is in contrast with the approach taken in other modern jurisdictions, such as the Philippines, which provides that the state shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception. The Czech Republic also states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. It is notable that the latter two jurisdictions have a predominatly Catholic majority, who are staunchly pro-life. Therefore, chances of a  universal concensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.[PROF**]

And if I'm not mistaken, the Vatican is the major significant party to restrict usage of the Hebrew term among themselves, in favor of non-Hebrew names, for some doctrine of theirs of papal infallibility.

 Comment intended for Schlafly page 
I received a 7-day block for my previous comments, and now an indefinite block. Here
is a comment that I intended for the Schlafly talk page.

I believe that the Phyllis Schlafly article falsely maligns Schlafly by misinterpreting a NY Times book review.

 The article implies that Schlafly opposed Nixon over """"segregation and discrimination"""",
while the source only says that she was with conservatives who were going to oppose whatever Rockefeller proposed.
 The article relies on a Jewish NY Times columnist raising a Jewish issue,
without mentioning that the columnist is a Jew who writes about Jewish issues, and that no one else raises this Jewish issue.
 The article implies that Schlafly used Jewish code words, while the source
does not explicitly say so. All the source really says is that her opinion is that
the biography should have commented on the matter further.

The WP BLP policy requires that these false allegations be removed.   """,0

 The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis 

The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. 

In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:

“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."""" 

The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: 

RESOLUTION 162

THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.

b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)

To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:

That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:
 
No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. 

Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. 

Can anybody say that  the wording:

“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”

does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?
Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.

Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.

Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necessary, according to the constitution, to give any reason. But you",0

Well, it does have some issues, so it seems.   First, I moved out one of the sentences that mentioned her ranking by NewsMax as a GOP figure.  I placed that to the other section about criticism and praise.  But, now there's just these two other sentences.   And they're really just dealing with her public appearances, which we've considered before… in fact, we eliminated them a while ago, if you see prior notes. See this Talk Page, where we mention that prior section once called """"Through all this time, Fiorina has appeared…""""  Remember that? We questioned the paragraph(s) and their citations and relevance.  Eventually it was eliminated. That's probably becasuse she's not unlike most public figures, that make many, many appearances through their lifetime.  That section has been gone a while now, seemingly without objection.  I'm guessing that's because most of us have agreed that we're not going to cite every appearance a public figure has made.  If its significant or exceptional, surely we can mention it.  But, now however, I'm wondering about a very short section that's currently titled Advocate at large.  That's since its become whittled down to two sentences, one of which is questionable.  I've actually found she may have appeared at Ripon several times.  But, to play devil's advocate… So what?  Republicans appear at crowds of conservative groups, Democrats before liberal groups, Greens before their own…. and so on.  Therefore, I question how exceptional this should be regarded.  By the way second sentence mentions """"National Press Club"""" as mentioned in the article.  But this Wikipedia article is attributing that to a Press club although it reads as """"National Press Club.""""  It's not particular to National Press Club (United States), which I'm not quick to assume, since the disambiguation the source (named in the citation) ambiguously calls it """"the National Press Club.""""  Again… appearing before THE National Press Club of the U.S. is not all that exceptional.  They invite notable dignitaries all the time… whoever, whatever party… etc.  Again, so what?   I wouldn't be surprised if The Club has invited most of the presidential candidates, if not had some of them speak in prior events, before they became candidates. So, I'm almost at the point of wanting to eliminate this entire section.  Any comments?   """,0

See, that's always the way I'd considered it, too (although I'm a Catholic who supports Liverpool). However, the debate still rages fiercely - I used to work at Radio Merseyside on the Roger Phillips phone-in, and it would crop up all the time. As soon as one person said on the phone that Everton were always the Catholic club, you'd get twenty people phoning in to say they were the Protestant club. It's such a fervent debate that there's really just not the space it needs on the Wikipedia entry, and surely the fact that there's even a debate shows that the religious affiliations of the two clubs aren't as ingrained in their existence as those of Rangers and Celtic - as such, I don't think it's necessary to include it.  14:47",0

First, the dust cover is not a part of the source (it wasn't written by the authors) and is irrelevant and not usable as a reliable source.  A case could be made that the reference made above was to the entire group of adults, and two of the five were unlicensed (the """"therapeutic"""" foster parents), but they are not the subject of the present controversy.

Second, Ponder was licensed, and the fact of her licensure has been verified by the book. Continuing to refer to her as unlicensed is false and should stop.  Ditto with Jeane Newmaker who was also licensed (as a nurse) and was being used during treatment as a """"co-therapist"""".

Third, both on page 28 and 44 of the source, the meaning of Watkins's unlicensed status was discussed and placed into the proper context I described before.  To take the term out of context and describe Watkins simply as unlicensed is to deliberately mislead and misinform the reader; her legal culpability and professional status was much more nuanced than that.  I grant that extensive discussion of the meaning of being """"registered"""" to practice psychotherapy in Colorado would be awkward in an encyclopedia, but if the term is used, then such a discussion should or must take place to properly inform the reader.  It is avoided, however, by not mentioning it out of context, which is what I've been doing by removing the references (which are wrong in the case of Ponder in any case).

Fourth, mentioning the licensure twice (and indisputably erroneously in the case of Ponder) is gilding the lily, especially when I came up with a reasonable solution for the second mention (i.e., using the defendants' surnames) instead of characterizing them.

Fifth, the way is """"unlicensed"""" is used in this article is unjustifiably POV. No justification for inclusion of this characterization has ever been tendered.

Partial consensus reached
This is Florida election night, so we really should enjoy ourself, and get on with improving this article. Therefor I would like to sum up what we have reached so far. As i see it we have concensus on most parts. Concensus meaning no one goes from the table happy, but nobody goes from the table with empty hands.
I have been bold and put in a new table, where I have incorporated much of what have been said in this discussion and other dicussions on the talkpage. Please read through this before undoing it.

Main Consencus: The table gets to stay, but it have to be changed

Lets go through the table colum by colum:
Date colum. Consensus: Days and years are gone to make it more elegant. Action: I have removed this from the colum
State colum. Consensus: No argument. Action: None
Type colum. Consensus: No argument. Action: I have removed the nonbinding/binding in caucus. It really couldnt explain the complex ways of the caucus. And it is redundant if the delegate count will be unbound/bound. Then everyone can see what kind of caucus it is anyway.
Delegates colum. Consensus: It have to change to something neater and easyer. Action: I have made two colums, unbound and bound. It is neater ) But more important. Personally I think it is the most important and educationel part of the table. So many comments on this talkpage shows that many have no idea what races actually gives delegates to the candidates and how many. Just read the discussions on the delegate count in the infobox. And the main tv channels dont help either. This will show how the delegates really are going.
Allocation colum. Consensus: No one in this dicussion, but on 3 other sections on this talkpage have been requesting it. Action: I have tried not to make it a tell-everything-in-depht colum as the old table have been accused to be. I have keept a very complex election cycle as simple as I could, without actually stating false fact. I feel this colum is important because in many ways this is new from the 2008 race. The complexity and the fact that many races are proportional means that a long race have a bigger chance of ending in a brokered convention. An fact that is important to educated about. And this can be seen out of this colum.
Winner, second and third colum. Consensus. Not yet reached. Action: I have kept them so far. And it is up to you all (me included) to figure out what to do.~
Source colum. Consensus: Get rid of it. Action: I have removed it. The references was mostly from the time of the """"schedule war"""" and 95% of those have been replaced with the reference at the end of the remarks in the top of the section (just above the table)

I might be wrong, but onless there is a strong consensus against the Bound and Unbound delegate colums, the only consensus left is about the Winner/second/third colum. No one gets everything (including me) but no one got nothing with this new table.
Now I have been bold, what do you say?    

I support the removal of the Winner, second and third colum. I don't see a reason to list X person as the winner in the infobox, then in this table, then in the subsequent table (immediately after), and then in each of the states own little blurbs on this page.

2nd No, you saw pretty wrong - the 2nd quote of the version I propose is not present in the current version. 

3rd Again... One more time... the present version has a serious flaw, as I put above in the section Spurious Quotations, by using a book citation in a spurious way doubly, not only by stating a different thing from the original citation, but mainly acting so, leaving a implicit meaning totally different from the original quote (To refresh your memory:) """" The original book citation states that in certain historical moment, a military revolt sparked a cycle of instability, while the present version using the 1st one in a partial way as reference (to give a veneer of respectability), states that the rise to power of the civilians, a year later, would have been responsible for the beginning of the overall instability.""""
""""Thus, spurious quotation aside, also a spurious correlation.""""

So, if to one:
a) eliminate such spuriousness and
b) put the appropriate initial causes of the instability of this period with proper references
is not an improvement... Well, it would become not just hard, but impossible to believe in this one's good faith, as well as it would be the confirmation of this one's selective double standard behavior... 

4th Concerning to the civilians' rising to power in the end of 1894, it was implied in some of my previous versions... 
which also, after more than a year... were not improved neither discussed, but disruptively reverted...
Anyway... for now, how about(?):
 """"The early Brazilian republican period was nothing more than a military dictatorship.* Following the bubble of encilhamento** and the 1st naval revolt, the country entered into a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by rebellions, both civilian*** as military,*** that even with the ascension to power of civilians at the end of 1894, did not stop. Little by little these rebellions undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930, in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, to lead a revolt.* """"
Oooor...
""""The early Brazilian republican period was nothing more than a military dictatorship,* and pretty before the civilians rise to power in 1894, following 2 severe crisis, an economic and a military,** the country has entered into a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by rebellions, both civilian*** as military.***' Little by little these rebellions undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930, in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, to lead a revolt.* """"

And Last but not Least, concerning to changes of Brazil's boundaries in the early 20th century, it is already there in the version I propose, in the foreign affairs, 3rd paragraph (that same one, which yourself considered """"pretty solid"""")...

So, any more doubts about this paragraph?

Tennis articles

Greetings Rich,

I'd just like to bring to your attention that, on some of the tennis articles, a certain user has been deleting the names of French (Roland Garros) champions, and changing the founding date of the championship. Even though outside sources, such as:

1. ESPN
2. Encylopedia Britannica
3. the Roland Garros website
4. the World Almanac

have supported the inclusion of all French Open winners to 1891, a single solitary user has been deleting the names of pre-1925 champions because it was """"not open to international competition""""but that's a lie. The very first winner, in 1891, was a British man, and two other British men made it to the final in the 1890s.

As to your first point, if the reverts were to get rid of BLP violations, I would support the person removing the BLP violations. Such biographies can have a serious impact on a person's life and social standing, so lies and unverifiable content in such articles cause far more damage than edit warring does. (This does not mean that I support edit warring on BLPs in general, edit warring over well-sourced information remains unacceptable.) However, FICT issues are not BLP, the damage caused by edit-warring and endless strife far over Pokemon outweighs the damage caused by breaching a notability guideline, so I cannot quite see the analogy here.

 Double Standard 

Cybershore, I've blocked you for a week for your last comment at Talk:Brazil.  You've been warned numerous times about personal attacks and yet you have persisted.  I have tried to help you, but I'm concerned about your behavior.  When your block expires, you may return to the discussion, but I strongly recommend you refrain from attacking other editors and try to be more concise with your comments.  Considering your ability with the English language it would be best to try to write shorter simpler comments.  
Cybershore, after carefully looking over your additions to the article (even with my changes to your grammer), I see that they are redundant and add nothing, while making some things less clear.  I oppose their addition.  

What """"additions"""" specifically you're talking about (so I can adjust or respond)?
Why, again this double standard behavior related just to one part; since, I answered all the objections one by one, while the seriously and gravely accusation made ​​up by me, and proved, repeatedly, throughout this year and a half about spurious quote remains ignored???

And Please answer this time:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?
Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors ...who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it? 
  
Your statements are very hard to understand.  I don't know what """"spurioness"""" means in English.  Once your block expire you may make your case clearly on the talk page, but do not edit war to include your changes to the article.  Consensus is opposed to these changes.  I've looked carefully at your suggested changes and find them to be inferior to the original content, muddling issues and making the entire section less clear.  This seems to have political implications to you, but as a neutral party I do not see them.  The current version seems to be neutral.   
""""I don't know what """"spurioness"""" means in English""""
What a curious, I believed that only machines could not find in their memories misspelled words ...Interesting to see that some humans also have this selective limitation...
What a curious II, that an administrator of an electronic publication simply """"doesn't know"""" such meaning... Oh!
Well, may be | this or | this can help you remin... understand what spuriousness means. Not mention  the 3rd paragraph of  this link in Brazil Talk Page about an famous example of writer's misquotations, fabricated quotes, fake quotes or whatever term you prefer...

Now that you are aware of the meaning of the term, I suggest that you read the this section ;) to remind you the tendentious, non neutral, biased and unethical feature of the whole paragraph of the version that you support.

After it, please answer the above questions",0

There's already Liturgical year, which discusses the Proper of the Season, although it can be a bit confusing since it discusses Catholic and Protestant uses, which aren't always the same. Any article would have to include both the pre- and post-Vatican II calendars, most notably Septuagesima and Passiontide as well as Ordinary Time vs. Time after Epiphany/Pentecost. The only change I see would be to create a specific """"Roman Catholic Liturgical Year"""" article. As for the 1962 Calendar of the Saints, I created the older one mainly because I already had the pre-1955 calendar in electronic format, it's more consistent with past use since Trent, and it includes feasts that were later dropped. I think the same article can be used for both the 1955 and 1962 calendars, adding the rank of feasts (Double/III Class), and some sort of special formatting or asterisks for Feasts which are only on one or the other.  
Re-reading the first comment, I'm also starting to like the idea. We can have one article on the year in general, what effect it has on the liturgy, and the arrangement of the liturgical books, with sections or sub-articles on the Proper of the Season and the Proper of the Saints, both articles discussing the 1955/1962 and 1970 versions.

"""CCD affecting other insects?==
While all this is certainly entertaining, the qoute does not stand on its own in that even if all honeybee populations collapse, mankind will not disappear. Wild pollinator insects, animals, and even wind can still pollinate many even most edible food crops. Even if those crops that depend solely on domestic bee pollenation cannot be produced any longer, humans would adapt agriculture to fill those niches.  

At this point it's not clear yet that CCD only affects bees.  It certainly stands to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder.  Also, the quote may be overly simplified.  But the big picture is that without pollinators, things are much more difficult. 

I have not seen any references that have indicated that wild bee populations, wild pollinators or other insects have been affected by the same disorder. If you know of any references that cite a similar decline in native or wild pollinators it may be helpful to include a section on this. 
Wild bees are generally becoming rare in the Western world due to habitat destruction. This is AFAIK most severe in C Europe.  
I agree that wild bees are increasingly rare worldwide, but the cause has little if anything to do with colony collapse.  
""""Little if anything""""? The proper and correct response is it has nothing to do with CCD. Even in the event that CCD should prove to be a """"disease"""", diseases are rather specific in what they affect, and a disease that affects honey bees is unlikely to affect any other insects; and there are only 7 species of honey bees. It's like expecting that a disease that affects deer will spread to other mammals, such as humans. That is an unreasonable expectation - it most definitely does NOT """"stand to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder"""" - the reality is exactly the opposite. The seven species in the genus Apis have had something on the order of 35 million years of independent evolution - 35 million years for their genomes to diverge from those of all other insects; compare that to the 70 million years mammals have existed. The human genome has had about as much time to diverge from deer, as the honey bee genome has had to diverge from other bees. But no one expects humans and deer to be affected by the same diseases. Why should a honey bee disease affect other bees?
While it is certainly true that habitat destruction and climate change are major threats to pollinating insects, bees foremost among them, CCD, even in a worst-case scenario, is not a threat to anything outside of agriculture.

 Trump's ethnic cleansing 

George Will, notable Conservative pundit, is the one whose view is that Donald Trump has proposed ethnic cleansing. I would never myself express an opinion in an encylopedia article. I merely voted that we add Will's highly notable opinion. This is in reference to his deportation plan of over 20 million Mexican-Americans, over half of whom were born here. Considering the amount of force one would require to deport 20 million human beings (hint:the military would most certainly be required), Will is by no means wrong or expressing an idiosyncratic view in accusing Trump of advocating ethnic cleansing, or a forcible homogenization of the population. Ethnic cleansing need not imply that Trump has promised to kill anyone, only that he has promised to """"make America more ethnically homogenous again"""", by force. Have a pleasant day.  """,0

I made such a minor edit to the article, and if there was any mistake, could he not have merely pointed out any errors to me as a newbie instead? Or does he have a problem with allowing newcomers to work on wikipedia as well and merely try to land them in trouble instead? I am not really sure why he is determined to complain about me no matter what edit I make, but his aggressive stance is clear, and if everyone were to behave this way towards newbies, I am sure wikipedia would become a very isolated place, which it is indeed not.

Q.  How are the barrels rotated?

A.  The rotational force is delivered by two hydraulic drive motors operating off of both main aircraft hydraulic systems (A+B).  The motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the Hydraulic drive assembly.  This in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts.  The forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the GAU-8 itself, while the second delivers it's power to the ammunition drum.

Q.  How long is typical spin-up time?

A.  While the system is capable of operating at 4200 rounds per minute, it is limited to 3900 while installed in the aircraft.  Since the GAU-8 has 7 barrels it needs to spin at 1/7th of the firing rate.  Basically since it's rotating a touch over 550 rpm the spin-up time is almost instantaneous. 

On another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish.  During the firing of the GAU-8 the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters (think super spark plugs) must fire to ensure a stall does not occur.  The engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be """"water washed"""" (have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. 80% power) periodically to remove soot from the blades.  Anyone who has had to clean an A-10 will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose.""",0

This paragraph in the introduction consists of two completely unrelated subjects. The 250th anniversary is already mentioned later in the article, so this sentence can probably be removed. The historic district sentence, then, could be incorporated somewhere else in the article. In fact, it is mentioned in the """"20th century to present"""" section so maybe we can move it there. I will make these changes tomorrow if no one objects.

Also, as I mentioned in my edit comment, I think the word """"semiquincentennial"""" should be removed. If a word is so obscure that you have to clarify what it means, why not just use the clarification instead? It looks a like a case of using a big word for the sake of using a big word. Again, I will make these changes tomorrow after giving ample time for comment. Thanks!   """,0
"On inspection, the references to '1996' in the 'Jim Bell' article are not footnoted.  (And, they never have been, since Skomorokh added them 2 years ago).  The AP essay was begun about April 1995, and eventually grew to include 10 parts.  The first 7 parts were written in 1995, and were published immediately as they were written.  Part 8 was a copy of an article by a journalist, Paul Maxwell, writing in the Asahi Evening News (English language newspaper in Japan).   It and parts 9 and 10 were written about February 1996.  You can be sure that by July 1995, 'the Feds' were well aware of the content of the (then-growing) AP essay. The Feds subsequently concealed their early knowledge of the AP article:  One technique they used, when the applied for a warrant, was for the affiant to claim something like, 'I first became aware of the AP essay on....'   That specific affiant ['affidavit writer' for you who don't know the law] may very well have 'first become aware' on some late date, but that doesn't mean that other Feds weren't aware, months or well over a year before.  It served the purposes of the Feds to make it appear not merely that the AP essay was written far closer to Bell's May 1997 arrest, but also to conceal the fact of their agent Walsh/Wilson's involvement perhaps one year prior to Bell's first attendance of MCCLC meetings.  Why?   It sounds much more like an 'emergency' if something happened yesterday, or last week:  They certainly wouldn't have wanted to have to tell the judge, 'Well, Bell wrote this TERRIBLE essay...two years ago' !!!
This explains, I believe, why Skomorokh claimed the AP essay was written in '1996', and furthermore gave no references. '1996' (at least, December 1996) sounds reasonably close to early 1997.  'April 1995', on the other hand, sounds like an eternity from May 1997, the month Bell was arrested.  71.36.117.224",0

"The following policy is given in Wikipedia:Verifiability: ‘articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy’. On the other hand Wikipedia:No original research states ‘Examples of primary sources include... ...original philosophical works...’ and ‘Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation’ it also states at the end of the paragraph ‘Appropriate sourcing is a complicated issue, and these are general rules. The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’
The above enables me to derive some conclusions: 
What is mend by “third-party sources” (WP:V) is not exactly the same as “Tertiary sources” (NOR). If the policies do refer to the same they contradict each other, which probably is not the case. I think “third-party sources” are, placed in context, ‘other sources than Wikipedia itself and its editors’; this would make sense, given what follows directly after the line containing “third-party sources”: ‘Reliable sources are necessary [...] to substantiate material within articles...’
Vassyana said ‘Reliance on Rand directly is a NPOV concern...’ it is now clear that it is of no concern at all. Yes ‘an interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source’ but when the text of the citation speaks for itself no further interpretation is required. She also said ‘there is absolutely no need to rely heavily in any way on the primary material’ which is still argued, in contrast I say there is absolutely no reason not to rely heavily on the primary material.
The arguments pro primary source material have, as of yet, not been given a response; the focus was on the demand to have (mainly) third-party sources. In the proper context primary sources are third-party sources, fulfilling the demand. Again ‘The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’ Let’s now focus on that.",0

"Request for comment: Wikipedia article on Pottery

This dispute is concerned with definitions of the term pottery and the way that differing definitions of the term should affect the content of the Pottery article.

The term pottery is defined narrowly by some reputable authorities to exclude everything but pottery vessels; pots, dishes and suchlike things. Other equally reputable authorities define the term more widely, to include such things as figurines, statuettes and tiles. 

The question of when and where the first pottery was made is a highly contentious one in some quarters. Attempts have been made on one side to prove that the earliest pottery is that represented by ceramic figurines found in the modern-day Czech Republic, while others have sought to prove that the earliest pottery is that represented by ceramic vessels found in modern-day Japan.

A protagonist in the dispute holds the firm opinion that only vessels can be pottery and from this argues that the pottery article must present without qualification the view that the Japanese vessels are the world's earliest pottery.  

Another protagonist in the dispute holds the view that the wider definitions of the term pottery should be taken into account and that mention of the Czech figurines should not be excluded from the article.

This matter has been discussed since February of last year under many headings on this page and at User_talk:Brunnock.",0

 When will Man be ready to accept that our Time is not the Time of the Universe?

Theory of Multi-Dimensional Scalable Worlds
By Dr. Fortunato Da COSTA in Theory of Multi-Dimensional Scalable Worlds * 

""""When will Man be ready to accept that our Time is not the Time of the Universe?"""" 

Principle I – Empiric – Entity and World Scale relationship: 
In the Universe each Entity (constellation, star, planet, animal, vegetable, micro organism, molecule, …) belongs to its own WORLD SCALE defined by two major dimensions the LIFE SCALE (Average Life Time Scale) and the SPACE SCALE (Average Size Scale) of the Entity. 

Principle II – Empiric – The fulfillment principle: 
Each particular Entity, in its Space Scale, has everything needed to complete its life cycle and in its respective Life Scale there is enough time to, also, complete its life cycle with success. 

Principle III – Empiric – World Scales existence: 
According to our human kind World Scale there is an undetermined number of Smaller World Scales below us – microorganisms, molecules, atoms, … – and another undetermined number of Larger World Scales above us – planets, stars, constellations, .... 

Principle IV – Empiric – Time and Space Relationship: 
The Life Scale is directly proportional to the Space Scale. As smaller the Space Scale of an Entity as small it is the respective Life Scale of that Entity. 
Nature clearly shows that there is a relationship between Life Scales and Space Scales – the empiric observation demonstrates that the absolute life time of a planet is much longer than of a human. And the absolute life time of a human is much longer than of a butterfly – so, there is an evident empiric relationship between Time and Space that we humans never saw and took into scientific consideration. 
Example of an empiric formula that can be applied: 

Life_Scale = K x Space_Scale 
( K ~ 30 years/meters for mammals ) 

Principle V – Empiric – Imaginary Multidimensional Worlds existence: 
In Euclid’s geometry, if we consider ourselves a point in a plan, we only can observe just a line: this means that if we are a point in a two dimensions world, we only can percept one dimension. 
The same rule can be extrapolated to understand that if we are an Entity in a four dimensions World Scale (X, Y, Z, and Time) there is, at least, another extra dimension that we cannot see or understand its existence because it is not possible to percept it from the World Scale where we are in. Only using the imaginary complex number i=(-1) ½ it is possible to mathematically define that imaginary dimension from the World Scale where we do belong. 
This takes us to the conclusion that multidimensional Worlds DO exist and we are part of Multidimensional Worlds with, at least, an extra dimension that we cannot observe or understand, because they are imaginary to us: i=(-1) ½. 

Principle VI – Empiric – Relative Intelligence and Relative Perspective: 
Can we ask to a blind born human the reason why the sea is blue? If the Entity does not percept the atmosphere color dimension, because it was never a Real Dimension in its World Scale, it is not possible for him to justify that phenomenon. The Entity only can make that justification if he is capable of creating a mathematical model where the sky color dimension is introduced as an imaginary dimension i=(-1) ½. 
So, we have to introduce two new concepts: the Relative Perspective and the Relative Intelligence. 
RELATIVE PERSPECTIVE is the set of Real Dimensions that the Entity cans percept from its World Scale. 
RELATIVE INTELLIGENCE is the capability of the Entity to understand, to predict and to make use of phenomena happening inside its World Scale’s Relative Perspective. By this principle all entities are rational and intelligent in their respective Relative Perspective Referentials. 
So, the Human Kind or any other Entity, only can justify the scientific phenomena that are totally functions of Dimensions that are Real (and not Imaginary) in the World Scale of that Entity. Unless the Entity is intelligent enough to extrapolate its relative perspective using imaginary dimensions, i=(-1) ½, in their mathematical models. 

Principle VII – Empiric – The Extra Imaginary Dimension existence principle: 
Why our Planet Earth has to change its rotation routines? Why there are Gravitational Forces that should approach the macrocosms but, instead, the cosmos is splitting itself? How can we justify scientific phenomena that we cannot understand? Obviously there is, at least, an extra imaginary dimension that we cannot percept or understand from our World Scale (X, Y, Z, and Time) that relates the different MULTI-DIMENSIONAL WORLD SCALES above and",0

James Hutton, speculating about the origin of salt deposits, wrote in his 'THEORY of the EARTH; or an INVESTIGATION of the Laws observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land upon the Globe' that """"THE formation of salt at the bottom of the sea, without the assistance of subterranean fire, is not a thing unsupposable, as at first sight it might be.

 Super Bowl Loss 

The recent Super Bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the Patriots franchise. The opening section discusses the """"dynasty"""" status of the Patriots, but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. This page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important Patriots facts. However, the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. It is beginning to feel like a protected fan page, as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the Patriots. Obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by Giants fans, but this page needs to acknowledge that the Patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time.  137.159.153.35  DLOMME 02/06/08

 Taunting Disguised as Factual Information 

Looking through the history of edits since the Super Bowl, a lot of information that's being added (and much of it since deleted) may be true, but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting.  Is it really relevant that the Patriots are the first 18-1 team NOT to win the Super Bowl?    Who cares?  And believe me, I'm no Patriots fan (they've been a thorn in my team's side since last season's playoffs), but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry, not a fan forum.  This page should be locked from any further edits for awhile, unless something TRULY relevant to the Patriots should suddenly occur.   
Actually, protection is not something to be taken lightly.  Being an admin (and even though I am a die-hard Pats fan myself), the level of problematic edits to this article, while high, is not so bad that we haven't been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos.  .talk.contribs

 Bias?? 

The Franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the Patriots.  Whenever a Superbowl loss is mentioned, the opposing team and score are given.  When it gets to the part about the Patriots winning Superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given, but it doesn't even say that they won them.  ie: """"Under Belichick, the team went to''' three Super Bowls in four years...""""  It should be consistant one way or the other.

The sentence, """"The Patriots, however, were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season.""""  is very clumsily tacked on to the first section.  I think it warrants another sentence or 2 or at least the deletion of the word """"howev",0

 First, I don’t want to silence flat Earth believers in what they say; however, I would like to point out what is said might be biased or flawed based on some reasons. NPOV should address all aspects of the issues no matter how small it is.  If someone makes a statement, there can be counter arguments. Wiki doesn’t have section A devoted to supporters and section B for proponents; therefore, the statements of both can be discussed in a fair and even through out the article. So is it not appropriate to have point counter point within the article?  Fair question, not trying to troll, but deserving a fair answer and if this is not the case then I will re-re-re-read the NPOV stuff.

Firstly, some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages...maybe you should read your own posts?

I won't comment further on the book, as I think my comments below are sufficient.
Regarding the Web sites, I would note that there seems to be very few Web sites on Plasma Cosmology / Plasma Universe (unlike sites on Big Bang cosmology), and I think that is worth taking into account.

... the site certainly isn't peer reviewed, and it is unlikely to have been produced by an """"authority""""... the Contact page says """"Independent Researcher""""
... The site more closely resembles a """"blog"""" since it appears to be produced by one person, but that is not grounds for automatic dismissal. We already include a page from the Web site of Ned Wright,, and while he is obviously an authority on Big Bang cosmology, I would argue that he is not an authority on Plasma Cosmology. Nevertheless, I am sure he points out some errors in Eric Lerner's work, and I am sure that Lerner has pointed out misunderstandings in Wright's.

Likewsise, I think there is value in plasmacosmology.net, even though there may be disagreements with parts of it.

 Criticism Section - Not Clutch 

This section is basically about how Arod is not considered to be clutch. The section is outdated and irrelevant due to his performance in the 2009 playoffs. No one debates whether or not he is clutch anymore. This entire section should be deleted. Does anyone disagree?  — (talk • contribs)  
I'm thinking about this.  Some of it could be kept, if put in a historical perspective.  But it is clearly over the top as it is.   
I just reread this section, and it's completely outdated. I still think it should be removed in it's entirety.   
Some of it needs to be kept.  Let's discuss what should stay and what should go.  I'm totally okay with reducing the size of it, but it needs to be mentioned.   
I made some dramatic changes to the section, trying to shorten it and update it.  Also, I've tried to reorganize the section as it had obviously grown organically over a long period.  My efforts are by no means stellar, and I suggest people look at the section with new eyes to see how to further improve it.  
It is, at the least, a good start.  Thank you.  I'll take a closer look at it later.   
Nice updates. The section seems relevant again.   
I made some minor copyedits to the section. I think the section ought to stay included  it's part of Arod's historical record that he's come under fire for being """"un-clutch"""" (ludicrous as those criticisms may have been). I'm also going to remove the tag suggesting integrating the section elsewhere  the section hardly gives undue weight to the controversy, which extended over a period of several years and occupied who-knows-how-many back pages in the sports press. bomb 

 Range Factor 

The range factor claims currently tagged as as """"citation needed"""" can be verified on ESPN's page (and probably elsewhere). The claims as stated are accurate and verifiable. I'd add the cite, but on second thought I question whether it's really a useful thing to state. It makes it sound like that's the final word on his defense, which it surely isn't. Range factor isn't the only defensive stat, and A-Rod does not rank last on many of the others. To cite it exclusively feels like you're trying to push a point of view criticizing him defensively. (Also, even on range factor, in 2004 and 2005 he was tied for last, not alone.)   

 """"Youngest to hit 600"""" 

This stat is misleading, while he may be the youngest to achieve this he took an above average time to do so. He played 183 more games than Babe Ruth. Because Rodriguez started playing baseball at a much earlier age than many of the greats should be noted. He is a good player, but statements concerning his age should be taken out. Games played/Seasons are a better barometer of talent than age.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 170.123.4.230

"""About Claim of POV and grammar errors for this article==

To: speedoflight

Your claim of POV and grammar error are not clear and not helpful. For instance, I cannot see what's wrong with the sentence: """"As a versatile actor, Cheung also acted in many comedies."""" With all the different types of roles and movies he acted, it is proper to call him a versatile actor. In addition, all the movies talked in the same paragraph are comedies. As the names of movies are already given, people can easily check out by either checking the movie itself or going to imdb or any other movie related website. Neither is there any grammar error in this short sentence. Without this sentence, the whole paragraph became confusing and ridiculous. In addition, I keep telling you that Cheung's niece never explicitly said in his funeral that Cheung was suffered from depression. This can be verified by the video record of his funeral published by Cheung's family. However, you stick on introducing this mistake again and again. In addition, Ouyang Feng's job in the movie Ashes of Time is killer agent instead of assassin, this is easy to verify as the movie's name is given in the article. I don't know why you change it to the wrong one. You also remove the movie link of Happy together. I can't see any of these revisions made by you have anything to do with POV or Grammar error.

As for the subtitle """"Golden Age in Film"""", it is just to address the blooming period of Cheung's Film career. Changing to """"Height in career"""" did not show anything about Film. If you want to change it to something else, at least you should not ruin the meaning. I can see that you are very anti-Chinese media. However, You should not bring personal feeling in editing. I can understand and am tolerant with Chinese media doesn't mean I would trust them. In fact, I am trying to dig out references not just from news media, but also books and original interviews, which make the job time consuming.

Again, it's no problem and you are definitely welcome to do editing. However, you need to be careful not introduce new mistakes in the article. In addition, please explain you point clear for others to understand and check outAugest 

I keep telling you to be patient as I am still in my process to finger out a better way to put references and resources staff. However, you keep removing things in all kinds of excuses, introducing tons of mistakes, and making the article ambiguous. If you want to put whatever references you want, go ahead and do it. Or if anything you consider as needed a reference, EXPLICITLY POINTED OUT. Don't just rudely remove things with ridiculous reasons. Not """"EVERY"""" piece of sentence needs a reference, otherwise ALL articles in wiki should be removed. I spent THREE months to verify the information, correct errors and finish the current article. To dig out all the original resources may need another 3 months. I also need break during the Christmas season. Please be patient!!! Augest 

Please don't remove background or useful information when you do """"gramma"""" corrections. Augest 

I think it's better to put Chinese version of Cheung's suicide note in his Chinese version wiki page to reduce redundancy. However, I don't have time to do it yet.

As for the references, I am still trying to think a better way to include them, as there are too much about him, please be patient. Thank you for the suggestions though! Augest

 No, I do think that Wikipedia should mention this effort on Buckley's part and have not said otherwise. Absolutely. Buckley's attempt to read Rand out spanned his whole career, N.R. articles through the 1960s, the """"RIP"""" at her death, and straight up to his book Getting It Right. It's not only important to Buckley's own history but to the history of the American Intellectual Right. Rand's friends and students influenced important people on the Goldwater campaign, in the Reagan Administration, and in the media, such as Limbaugh, Beck, Stossel, Napolitano, Neal Boortz, etc., who have all cited her repeatedly, recently and favorably, recommending the very book that the Buckley/Chambers's review was all about. No, Rand was not a """"conservative"""" and my admiration of Rand, though contextual, includes respect for the fact that she never called herself a """"conservative"""" and never would have wanted to be part of such a movement. She doesn't get to decide these things any more than Buckley does, however, and it is Rand's actual, important and on-going influence among self-described conservatives that determines this. Limbaugh, for example, has extensively quoted from Atlas Shrugged on his air  without qualification  and more than once. Even Sean Hannity on his Fox program has favorably mentioned the new Atlas Shrugged movie. Tea Party activists cite Rand much more than they do Buckley, and carry photos of Rand at their demonstrations. Times have changed since Buckley's attempt.-  """,0

Notability of Julia Olteanu
A tag has been placed on Julia Olteanu requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 SC Info 

Im almost positive that this is not the place I'm supposed to be responding, but there is no reply link at your message.

Part of the reason for my """"offense"""" is that I think your being unfair in referring to it as spam.

If I was just posting """"Hey! Come visit my site,"""" without any contribution, that would be one thing. But, when I posted anything from my own site, I had news attached to it.  You didn't have a problem when I posted the news of the departure of the producers and writers of the movie and linked to RopesOfSilicon.com, and you also didn't have a problem when I posted the purchase of Dreamworks by Paramount and linked to Yahoo! News, but when the news happened to come from my site, even if it is legitimate news, it's spam. I happen to be in a position that I have connections and can make alot more news than other sites. But that shouldn't make the news any less relivant in getting it to people. 

When I take the time and care enough to try to make sure the info is correct, only to have it removed and replaced by the same wrong information, it's very frustrating, and it does come back to us at Ubisoft. For example, someone came to the official forums and said they saw on Wikipedia that Tom Cruise had accept the role of Sam Fisher in the movie. Well that is not true. So I had to correct him and that has happened a few times with a few wrong pieces of information. Which is why I went to the extent to find the correct info. But, if you are not in control of the other pages...and judging by the fact that the incorrect info that I removed has been replaced, it seems those who are in charge seem to perfer having incorrect information posted, so my hands are tied. 

Frankly, I'm getting tired of trying to help and getting railed back for what I see as petty reasons everytime. 

Also the back and forth with you removing my fan page from the list and the two other sites to the bottom, only to have me move them back was something I did because I have problems with an owner of another fansite following me around and well..not being nice. I was thinking it was him that was removing the info.""",0

I understand where you are coming from. I have no actual proof that those are legitimate street names, but I have a case to argue. I feel that no citation should be needed for the addition of street names, and I say this because it varies. Street names vary from culture to culture, of which I am sure you are aware of. I feel that in order to provide the most accurate information about this topic there needs to be a diverse culture of editors. I hope that makes sense. Wikipedia is supposed to provide the most accurate information possible, and I am just trying to add to it. By adding certain slang names, it opens up people’s knowledge. Being a user myself, I feel that my information is VERY accurate, seeing as how I would use the terms on a daily basis. Sure there is no citation, but there is an addict that lived the lifestyle. That should be a citation enough. I hope you now understand where I am coming from.

Thanks,
 

I disagree.  If it is a used streetname, there simply are references for it.  I am sorry, but information is not accurate because the person that adds it says so, accuracy should be measured by reliable sources.  
That street names vary from culture to culture indeed is known, and I am not saying that we should not have streetnames in articles, they indeed are a welcome addition.  The thing is only, what if I am a vandal, and I want to add the streetname 'mobile' to the list of MDMA-streetnames (I could add a whole list of common objects that people carry around when being in the street, and I have seen that happening) .. from your point of view, you would not contest that.  Now seen the seriousness that you have in editing the article, and since you have taken the effort to open a wikipedia account, I don't think you are a vandal, but still the same principle would apply.

Someone in WP management needs to look at the Barbara Biggs entry, as it seems to my amateur eyes to be largely an advertizement of Biggs books, and a beat-up of her deeds and status based on what is written in same self-authored books. There are some references to media who interviewed her about her books/deeds but these again rested mostly on her own opinions about herself drawn from her self-authored books.

"Hi.  I will work through an example for you.  In most Western economies, money borrowed to invest is tax deductible.  In other words, you are only taxed on net profits associated with a business or investment venture such as a 'carry trade' in assets, cash, bonds, or commodities.

So let's say the hypothetical 'carry trader', as typically depicted in the financial media, is borrowing Yen at 0%, and investing in US treasuries or overnight repos at 5.25%.  Sounds like a profitable trade, right?  Read on.

Now, consider that said trader pays a marginal income tax rate of 40%.  And consider that Japan has been in deflation for the past number of years, at deflationary rate of -1%.  In the same time period, US inflation has been running at roughly 2.5%.

The 'real' cost after-tax cost of Yen = nominal after-tax cost - rate of inflation.
The 'real' return on USD assets = nominal after-tax returns - rate of inflation.

So, for the Yen borrowing, the calculation is 0% * (1-40%) = 0% - (-1%) = 1%
And for the USD investment = 5.25% (1-40%) = 3.15% - 2.5% = 0.65%

So the real rate of return on USD investment is 0.65%, while the real cost of Yen borrowing is 1%.  Since the real cost of Yen borrowing exceeds the real return on USD investment, a so-called 'carry trade' should not have an expectation of profit.

Hedge funds and other institutional players are usually intelligent enough not to engage in activities that do not have expectations of profit.

Therefore, it can be argued that all the talk in the financial 'media' or even in the 'Economist' about a so-called profitable 'carry trade' is complete nonsense.  It is true that there might be some speculators who have placed (and done well with) bets against the Yen in recent years since the bubble burst in the 90s, but to confuse such with a profitable 'carry trade' defies logic.",0

 Silesians 

Andrew, I have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by """"reverting the article upside down""""; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  

Thanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.
However, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)
I am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.

With Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.

Now, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.
Finaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.
Returning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column  on Polish terytory in addition.

Sorry if I used posibly ofencive """"reverting the article upside down"""" that was in the heat of the battle, wich I still have with Ge Wiki. They just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. That sucks.

 Islamophobic material 

A cursory examination of the content of the blog shows a great deal of openly islamophobic material, in contrast to JIDF's self-description as purely opposing anti-Semitism on the web and even the moderate material is overtly slanted in a hateful direction. For example, a headline in response to the Fort Hood massacre is """"It's Islam, Stupid"""". It also supports conspiracy theories that Obama is a """"secret muslim"""" . It also shows [Kahanist] tendencies, posting memorials to controversial, racist anti-Arab figures such as [Meir Kahane].

So far the JIDF has managed to fly under the radar, but it is only a matter of time before notable sources pick up on the hateful content of this site. This can and will be reported on Wikipedia. Until then, taking it's self-published description at face value is unwise. The current, overly positive wikipedia page is a disappointing whitewash.   """,0

 Edit disagreements  

Where are you getting the figure range for '300-3000' from? I couldn't find these figures in any of the sources you cited, unless you're estimating based on predictions from the article.
Abu Omar al-Shishani is not the chief in command of both Iraq and Syria. This is ridiculous. I don't know why so many people believe this. I suspect it might be becuase he is so prevalent in the IS propaganda that he is somehow the Islamic State's version of Napoleon Bonaparte. I cannot find any reputable source claiming he is anything more than a field commander in northern Syria. He doesn't even feature in any IS leadership hierarchies, which are almost exclusively staffed by Iraqis who have been in the organisations since the early-mid 2000's. When the former commander of the IS Military Council passed away in June 2014 (Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi), Iraqi secutyi forces found some memory sticks and a laptop containing the following leadership information currently pieced together by western analysts. Note how al-Shishani doesn't feature in any of them, save one which turned out to be incorrect. Here they are: , , . Here is the false one which showed al-Shishani succeeding al-Bilawi as the IS military chief of the Military Shura: . However, it was Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another IS Iraqi commander who had been in the organisation years before al-Shishani had joined who succeeded al-Bilawi as the Chief of the Military Shura. He is shown in the graph as Adnan Latif Hamid al-Sweidawi which is his real name. You never see the upper echelons of the IS hierarchy, the ones who actually control everything. They are not shown in IS propaganda. They are clandestine, mysterious, shadowy figures. Only the pawns are revealed.
You keep stating that Jamaat-ul-Ahrar have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. This is just not true. You might get this impression becuase they broke away from the TTP or the Pakistani Taliban, which swear allegiance to the head of the Afghan Taliban Mullah Omar. But the spokesperson for Jamaat-ul-Ahrar stated that they pledged allegiance to the Taliban leader . The leader of Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Omar Khalid has strong ties to Ayman al-Zawahiri and Al-Qaeda, a nemesis to the Islamic State. 
You state that Abu Sayyaf have sworn allegiance to the Islamic State, however, the man who swore allegiance to them is not the groups leader, so it is unclear whether or not he is representing Abu Sayyaf or a splinter faction. 
You write that Ansar al-Islam is an Al-Qaeda affiliate, but I can find little to no proof affirming this position. The leadership of Ansar al-Islam have rejected the notion that they swear allegiance to al-Qaeda, despite collaborating with their affiliates, such as the al-Nusra Front.U.S. terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna in January 2003 however disagreed with Krekar and affirmed links of Ansar with al-Qaeda: “Ansar al-Islam has links with al-Qaeda – in fact it is an associate group of al-Qaeda”.]. The U.S Defense Intelligence Agency seemed to have affirmed this when they wrote """"Ansar al-Islam is an independent organization that receives assistance from al-Qaeda, but is not a branch of the group.""""DIA, Special Analysis, July 31, 2002, cited in Postwar Findings about Iraq's WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How they Compare with Prewar Assessments, pg. 71.""",0

Until and unless a fully balanced viewpoint is presented (ofcourse in compliance with WP:BLP) in the article, the tag cannot be removed. BTW  , there is absolutely no necessity for a 24-hour window, as it is perfectly clear to any Non-Islamic fundamentalist from the talk page that this article is totally disputed.

After the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, there was a certain resurgence of Ustaše symbology coinciding with the residual hate from the recent war. This phenomenon was mitigated with the passing of legislation by the Croatian government banning Ustasha symbols and associated references.

The reasons for the change include:
 There is no evidence of resurgence in ideology, but lots of evidence of increase use of symbology especially around areas that suffered heavy casualties and devastation during the war - thus the adjustment to reflect this fact;
 No evidence of paramilitaries adopting the ideology - I do not count HOS in that group who had a Party of Rights agenda as opposed to an Ustasha agenda - often the two get confused as the same b/c the Ustasha was an offshoot of the party of rights and there was some crossover in political goals e.g. independent Croat state; notion of historical territory ;

 OK  
Regarding your recent message about """"Naked"""", my edit is based on the character's arguable status as an anti-hero. It becomes apparent to me that Leigh's intention was to portray someone who, while probably hailing from a higher academic milieu or background (whether conventional or self-taught) uses his eloquence and education in an deliberately overbearing manner. You cannot deny the fact that the film clearly passes judgment on the character on this and other levels. I just wanted to summarize this in a few words. 
  

Most of the already-existing text (e.g. terms such as """"reckless"""" or """"egotistical"""") would also qualify as non-neutral if subjected to a thorough scrutiny.   

Thanks for the reply. I'd suggest finding references for any further changes you wish to make to the article. I also suggest raising any questions in article talk regrading other changes you propose.   
I'm not going to enter a futile edit war just for the heck of it, especially now that your attention seems to be fixed on my particular edit for this particular article, but I cannot leave this unanswered. There are no references for most of what is already written about this film in the wiki page. I'll say again: if we were to subject this to the same level of scrutiny all along, the summary for the film would be """"A human male flees Manchester for London and has conversations, and some intercourse, with a few characters, gets beaten and leaves"""".

 Genres 

 I can see this is becoming an issue on a number of other pages.  It's not enough simply to have a source when adding genres to an infobox:
 The """"genre"""" field should be limited to genres that describe the album (or group, or whatever) in general, and not every genre that has been incorprated into it.  Imagine what the Beatles' infobox would look like otherwise.
 The sources you are citing are not necessarily supporting the genres you're adding: for instance, Earles says: """"Side B is ... proto-Sabbath sludge metal or proto-noise rock, depending on how you wish to retroactively consider this stuff against the underground rock history that came before and has transpired since ... etc etc doom metal scene etc etc power- and thrash-metal movements ..."""" ... it takes quite an imagination to read that and conclude that My War is a """"sludge metal album"""".

 Colorado balloon incident 

Greetings. I reverted your addition of a news photograph of the Colorado balloon incident balloon. Unfortunately, Wikipedia's use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. As the template you used states: """"Use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature, when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts"""".  It's intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. 

Even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography: Wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because non-free media compromises the freely licensed status of Wikipedia. Refer to the first rule at WP:NFCC; non-free images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. There were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike, almost any would do for the purposes of the article. Wikinews claims that the balloon was low-flying and that photographs were captured by area residents.  

The best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. The effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. I've been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry, though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.

I hope I haven't given the impression that I do not appropriate your contributions to the article— as I do, especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably. Thanks for your contributions!   """,0

"United Kingdom
I think the United Kingdom itself maybe be emerging to be an early 21st century super power with the US as the world hyper power. Here's the reasons for me thinking this:
Second to the US in world diplomacy
Second highest defence budget
Second largest navy in terms of tonnage
Second most power projection capability
Second largest aircraft carrier fleet with second largest aircraft carries being built after the Nimitz aircraft carriers
UN Security Council seat and founding member
Head of the Commonwealth of Nations (the largest organisation of states after the UN)
The British monarch is also Head of State of 15 other countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
Major player in NATO and EU
Large North Sea oil and gas production
London being one of the greatest cities in the world 
City of London being the world's main financial centre in terms of number of amount of money that passes through it each year and largest gathering of financial groups.
Pound Sterling one of the world's top currencies alongside US Dollar and Euro
Second highest growth for major developed economies after US.
Its own nuclear missiles on nuclear submarines which have joint longest range with US nuclear submarines
Largest number of over seas territories
Carried out major invasions of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. 
Was only the nation to actually invade Afghanistan and Iraq alongside US forces (Other forces came after US & UK forces had secured the countries)
Second largest force in Iraq and Afghanistan 
Leads the fight against Afghan rebels in Helmand province
Controls southern Iraq and large areas of Afghanistan
Leads NATO force in Kosovo
The leading nation in tackling global warming
A leading country in the Middle East road map to peace
Most involved in Darfur issue
Second most involved in Iran nuclear issue
Single handedly resolved Sierra Leone issue
I think since the end of the Cold War to present the United Kingdom has played the second largest role in the world after the United States, and after all the role a country plays in the world is what defines a super power. Also the United Kingdom demonstrated that it can single handedly and quickly defeat a regional power and quickly resolve a conflict when it won the Falklands War. This is more than what can be said for such countries as the United States or Former Soviet Union. After the Second World War and during the 1950s the United Kingdom was considered to be a super power because of the role it played in the world but the after effect of the Suez crisis made this disappear. The Falklands war and Thatcher-Reagen era displayed the UK was preparing to retrieve its status as being on the same level as the USA and USSR. Soon after this the Cold War ended and with no Soviet Union left to counter the United Kingdom in any way (like in the Suez crisis) the Thatcher-Reagen duo had worked and the United Kingdom set in motion activities to reclaim such a postion it had in the world that it had in the world before the Suez crisis in time for the beginning of the 21st century. The 1990s was a bit of a prelude to today and saw the United Kingdom slowly begin to prepare as being a power equal to the US and former USSR by being eager to greatly contribute to the Gulf War and and Yugoslav wars and grew more involed in Western Africa by sending troops there to resolve conflict in Sierra Leone and was testing its place as second most powerful in the world to the US and in being a semi super power again. Soon afterwards September 11th happened and the War on Terror that followed gave the United Kingdom just what it needed to reassert itself on the world stage and came just at the right time to have given the United Kingdom time to perpare and try out its future after the end of the Cold War and for the beginning of the 21st century. Today the United Kingdom is easily seen as being second most powerful on the world stage diplomatically and even militarily and could be called a semi super power. People have started to raise this issue called the British Moment in the 21st century. The United Kingdom also acts very much as a deciding force in NATO and the EU in which policy they take or their futures in whether it decides to side with the US or EU and can have an effect around the world. It also greatly influences the other 52 members of the Commonwealth of Nations which it heads by its monarch and is the largest body other than the UN. Not to mention its influence and veto power of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council.",0

You do not have the right to supress this warning unless you contact me and/or give an explaination for your reason to suppress it. You failed to do any iof it.
I idn't receive any messages from you not even after you had banish me, yhought your message above is dated of the 26 of august it wasn't there at that date and I am sure of it. I didn't have acces to anything that day.
About the things I edit, they are of the most relevant kind to what is sayed ont this site.
All pseudo subbjects are all lies as the Bogdanovs have alredy answered all those points in different places of the web, inclusiv wiki, at different times, for the past 2 years.
For 13 days ago there was absolutely nothing more to discuss about, and seeing that, YBM used his ususal tactic who is to do as if they din't have answered the questions at hand, and that way, confuse the other users and make them believe that it was the case, as he has always done since 2003.
Someone has to stand up and say it, someone has to put an end to this circus, and I choose to do so.
I do not have followed the story from the beginning and do not know the Bogdanov but through this affair, that I begin to interest myself with since the beginning og august.
Two things became clear for me as I scanned all the web on the subjects: YBM was the person doing all the staging, and YBM didn't knew what he was talking about. I also found out that no matter how many times and in how many languages and by how many specialists the answers were given to him, he will keep asking and accusing peoples, and agress them personnally and accuse them of not being edicated in that field or critisized their university or making threat at contacting their chiefs, and even insult them to push them away from the discussion platform, as this kind of people represented a real threat to his status.
And of course, especially when we are talking of the scientific platform like in fr. physic or scent physic, those people, phd or professor at university were not used at being roll around with nor being talking to that way and even less at being insulted and confronted with non argumentativ methods.
So they left and never show up again, leeving all free room that YBM could ever wish for to pursue his goal.
But what was this goal exactly?
It wasn't the truth as he kept lying and had been given all answers, and was often denying to have done certain things who were appearing very often.
He was repeating himself and soon I saw a pattern emerging, from all his apparitions on the web, with falsh accusations, lies, home made stories, fantasyfull evidences, links to web sites from his own making, agression, personal attacs, insults.
His goal was not at all to discuss science but to manipulate others and he managed to do so very well as he was allowed to fool so many for such a long time. T>wo years is a very long time for a little subject as this one.
Then I was contacted by people who had been confronted to him, prior to this case, and had been subject to the same attacks and methods on the web.
I stude it, and saw worse than I could ever imagined. It was all planed from the beginning and a part of an ideologie with filosofical pretenses on how one could manipulate other people meaning by creating a situation on line.
It is what they call Post situationism, and wich is issued of Voyer. In the previous case against a teacher that he knew from school and a women writer (on cooking books!) he had just met Voyer but been found of him for a longer time, by the beginning of Bogdanovs affair he had been introduce inside the rangs of Voyer and Co, and as the affair progressed assured himself a high status in this """"confrerie"""".
That is the reason why this article I come with is of such importance. It reveal what was behind all along, what motivated the principal actors of this mascarade, and show all that they have been manipulated from the beginning and still are.
There is no Bogdanov affair, it is an illusion, a part from a group of ideologs making a thinking experiment and giving life to it by means of the internet.
Brillant! Unless there was casualties.
And there is.
Plenty of, and more than the Bogdanovs private sphere and their career.
I was really aroused from the beginning when I realised what YBM was about but even more when I saw what it all was really about, I was shocked by how unpropper and unethical it all was, and what a big unjustice it was to all who were involved in it, and this also include people who have followed and defended the apparent vews of YBM not kn",0

Given the unique nature of comicbook material, we give them leeway on relying a good deal on primary sources.

That really go there because I trimmed through FCH, and had a lot of third party sources on some plot lines that involved him and the character's creation.

Wikipedia:WikiProject Succession Box Standardization:  The work of this group is interesting, even though I am not myself drawn to join in at this point.  I did ask the following question in the SBS WikiProject talk/forum ... (in anticipation of something we both might want to tackle in the future?):

Exceptions to standardization?  My guess is that there are some plausible and well-informed reasons for those cases in which standardization is not the best choice.  

My question becomes relevant in that context:  Will someone please give me one example in which an understandable interest in standardization was not sufficient to overcome the reasons for a specific non-standard succession box?  One would hope that there would have been more than one illustrative example ...?  

I understand your question to be, 'Are there examples where the standard succession box is not the best choice.'  There is a long-standing disagreement about which article should be linked to from U.S. representative's boxes (discussion here: Template talk:USRepSuccessionBox) .  For example, should New Hampshire representatives' boxes link to United States Congressional Delegations from New Hampshire or List of United States Representatives from New Hampshire?  I happen to like the former, since all of these articles for all of the states are fully populated.  Another editor very much would like it to be the latter, expecting the articles to become populated once many articles link to them.  If the Template talk:USRepSuccessionBox gets changed, I was contemplating creating an alternate standard for some states, which admittedly wouldn't be ideal. 

Standardization of succession boxes is something we try to do to fit all needs.  Quite often we find exceptions to the rule, but when that occurs, we either bring it up here to discuss, or find some easy and manageable solution that attempts to correct it.  Personally, I have run across numerous templates that are not in this series and cannot easily be corrected to work with it.  In those cases, I try to convert everything I can in the code and leave or customize the rest to work with the format established.  This was everything that has been standardized is standardized, leaving only the code that we currently have no standards for.  As you can tell from the templates page, there are many templates in this series and many that are not.  Some of the members including myself are attempting to remove as many of the older (and often very complex) templates to this simpler format.  However, some templates such as those for the Canadian parliament are not even undergoing review currently until the current problems are resolved due to their advanced codings.

I hope this somewhat answers your question.  Was there anything specific you were wondering about?– ( Talk • Contributions ) 

I must add that I have myself been removing such templates for quite some time, and have adopted a specific format for both Representatives and Senators, samples of which one can find in the succession boxes for the United States Presidents. My versions look essentially the same as the old ones, with some redundant text having been removed. Link modifications can be performed on these newer, simplified templates much easier, as editing a template is a very different thing indeed from simply editing pages. , The Duke of 

Cut me some slack here, please: I'm the one who initially asked about exceptions to standardization, and now I'm going to try to sketch a bit of the rationale behind that query.  In a way, I hesitated to post any question in the first place for fear of arousing anyone's too eager interest  but now I have no choice but to deal with any unanticipated consequences.  

My concern is focused on pre-Meji Japanese history. I'm persuaded that the succession boxes for Emperors of Japan and Japanese era names are fine the way they are  for now; but they could become better, more useful, more focused ....  

In January 2008, I'd like to begin to work with others in a process of possibly improving the format somewhat, but I'm too wrappe",0

"Nonsense. The Syrian army committed 1,500 men. They were wholly unprepared for the war, having received notice that they were to fight just a few days before the 15th of May. Their logistics were poor - they had handed over a part of their munition reserves to the Arab Salvation Army, and given its scarcity of war matériel had to husband what was left. Its knowledge of the theatre of war where it was to conduct operations was minimal. It took then almost a week to get their tanks over the Jordan. Their first advance was roundly defeated, with heavy losses. On the 18th under Husni Zaim they attacked and took Samakh, south of Tiberias, only to lose it in three days after an Israeli-kibbutznik counter attack. This massive army 'with artillary, tanks, (armed?)armoured cars and airforce stocked with Harvards, (not Harvard-armed aircraft!!, which is a brilliantly comical image)' took 4 days, involving almost all that the Syrian army could muster, to capture a little  moshava like Mishmar HaYarden, with its 20 local guards (Tal p.261) which had to fight on its own, without IDF assistance.

"First and foremost, Lynda Kiejko won a gold medal and a quota in the 10 m air pistol, and added her second gold in the 25 m pistol. Because she already earned a quota in the air pistol, the Olympic slot has been distributed to the runner-up Sandra Uptagrafft of the United States. Granted the athlete has not yet earned a quota for their country means that a quota must be distributed to a different athlete from any country, as long as the NOC has been entitled to a maximum of two shooters per event. In Kiejko's case, she is eligible to compete in the 25 m pistol, but her place must be confirmed by the NOC and ISSF, along with the quota she won in the 10 m pistol. 

 Second, I notice that you added Michel Dion of Canada. Cassio Rippel already won a quota in the 50 m rifle prone. Because Brazil has reserved a place in each of the nine events, and he competes for the host nation, this does not imply that the quota has been distributed to Dion. As per rules on the host country places, these will only be granted in any of the nine places entrusted to the host nation, if it did not obtain any place in that event during the qualification period. With Rippel's victory at the Pan American Games, the host country still keeps a quota in the 50 m rifle prone. If he is confirmed by NOC to compete for the Olympics as long as he obtains the MQS (minimum qualifying score), then the unused host country place will be reallocated to the NOC with the highest MQS that has not yet obtained a quota place or been granted a Tripartite Invitation for the Games.

I hope that you fully grasped the rules and regulations on the distribution of Olympic quota. In case you may have not clarified about this case, I share you the link. . Thank you!",0

 Calling for a movement to eliminate Biritsh spelling on wikipedia 

This is a very serious issue that needs to be confronted. It is not professional, non-NPOV, and inconsistent that we have some articles with British spelling, and others without. There are even some articles that deal with something thats exclusively American, such as the White House for example, that have some words spelled the British way. This should not be, and there should be some uniformity if we wish to have a professional and reliable encyclopedia.

Britian is the only English-speaking country that uses their own unique variation of the English language, and in British contexts, that's usually fine. But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds, and that should be the standard that Wikipedia uses. It makes absolutely no sense to use one country's variation of dialect, no matter how BIG, important, or """"popular"""" it is, and completely disregard the rest of the English-speaking world's orrect usage of the language. 

In fact, pretty much every article that contains a word that differs between the two dialects, the British version is favored. This, also, makes absolutely no sense. If the majority of a population speaks and/or writes a certain way, then it's institutions, endorsements, and websites should speak/write that certain way, too. It is understandable if this website was: www.wikpedia.co.uk, because that assumes that this is a primarily UK website. But, this website is: www.wikipedia.com, so it should follow the standard dialect that other """".com"""" use. 

This isn't in any way some sort of hate movement or opinion. This is an encyclopedia, and in encyclopedias, information must be consistent and reliable. Please take your time to think about this issue, for the uniformity of this encyclopedia will help ensure that the current and future quality standards will be upheld.

Something stands out about the championship match of WrestleMania XV
After taking a look through some old notes, I think I noticed that the only time that a """"heel"""" won the major championship of the WWE from a """"face"""" at any WrestlaMania is at the 1999 WrestleMania, when Steve Austin won it from The Rock.   In any version of the major championship {WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship), the only time I remember seeing the """"heel"""" leave the major championship match of WrestleMania as the champion is only when he entered the match as the defending champion (such as Chris Jericho successfully defending against Edge in 2010, and the Miz successfully defending against John Cena in 2011). Otherwise, the """"face"""" typically wins the major championship match, especially when the face is the defending champion.
This may just be speculation, but probably the reason that Steve Austin as the """"heel"""" got to win the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 15 is because it was held in his home state of Texas. ..
.. So, this major championship match of WrestleMania 30 should be quite interesting in the way it unfolds, as there are two possibilities; if in the Bryan/HHH match, Triple H were to win, the triple threat major championship match would have all three participants as """"heels"""", including the champion Randy Orton, making it so that no matter who wins, the champion would be heel regardless of who the champion is, barring a """"face turn"""". On the other hand, if in the Bryan/HHH match, Daniel Bryan were to win, the triple threat major championship match would have two heels including the champion Randy Orton, and one face, obviously being Daniel Bryan - and if that's the case, with the history being the way it is with this sort of thing, they would almost assuredly mean they would have to have Daniel Bryan win the big championship match, as WrestleMania history usually dictates. Although, we never know how they might possible go against their own history. Plus, there's no telling whether they will even have Daniel Bryan defeat Triple H to get into the triple threat match at all. 
 
But they could surprise everyone and have the championship match end up being a fatal-four-way match, in which case anything could happen. But I think the majority of us might agree that the one least likely to come out of the championship match with the championship is Batista; he's the only one of the four guys to disappear before long, since he hasn't been there. But also, being that Randy Orton is the """"heel"""" and that he's had the championship since October, he too isn't likely to be the champion after that match. So, if we were putting odds on it, all historical facts considered, the two most likely to have the championship after that match (be it a triple threat or fatal four way, if that were to happen) is either Daniel Bryan or Triple H - Daniel Bryan because he can be the hero of WrestleMania as the good guy, or Triple H because he hasn't had the championship in five years and because he's the boss.
But as I say, to my recollection, only in 1999 did a heel win the major championship at WrestleMania.   """,0

"Purposeful misinformation on the Orban page 

Hi - I noticed by chance that earlier this month a user from Malaysia decided to use a modified version of the script of the Fetih 1453 movie to alter the text of the Orban article. He continued with some minor changes and someone else just did another grammar change. The modifications are both unsubstantiated and ridiculous (both in terms of the language used and the obvious ideological angle).

I am hoping you can help since I am already seeing people outside of WP cite the article (which is how I noticed it).

"""Fish-man, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.  Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.

First, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.)
Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  """"No-boo"""" may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.
If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called """"The No-boo Affair"""", then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is """"the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did"""", it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a """"clear falsification"""", but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term """"no-boo"""" becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted.
Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this """"No-boo Affair"""" is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.

It is important to understand that an encyclopedia is not simply a gathering of assorted facts, but rather a secondary source that compiles significant pieces of human knowledge that have already been well-established by other sources.  There are many places on the internet and offline where you can disseminate facts and opinions about this event, but Wikipedia is not one of them.  — 18:08, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)""",0

[Moved post from Sarah down to proper chronological space; it interrupted my unblock request subsection placed chronologically before it above.   ]

As one of the victims of your repeated and persistent personal attacks and false accusations, I don't think that you should be unblocked early because I feel that a message needs to be sent about your continued personal attacks, blatant violations of AGF, CIVIL and NPA, which are even prominently displayed on this very talk page in your lengthy commentaries about Orderinchaos in particular. I have tried to stay away from here since the ANI was closed, but as you continue making accusations and comments about me, I must say that I consider your comments to be personal attacks and I consider the post that Gnangarra linked to in particular to be defamatory and libelous and I feel that you should agree to refactor those comments, and the other personal attacks you made about editors on ANI, as I see has also been previously suggested by Shell as well. The """"do not edit the archive"""" notices in the ANI archives are designed to prevent people from continuing discussions in the archives, rather than to prevent people removing defamatory material. You claim that you've been """"slandered"""" (actually libeled). I believe everything I have said about you has been absolutely true, however, if I have inadvertently made a mistake and it was pointed out to me, I would redact it. Unfortunately, every time I have interacted with you you have made demonstrably false accusations, accusing me of doing things I had clearly and provably not done at all and so I am rather reluctant to believe that I have posted something factually untrue, but I am quite prepared to go back and re-examine my comments and refactor if I have made a mistake. When you wrote these offensive and defamatory comments about me, I had been deliberately trying to refrain from saying very much on the ANI due to your previous hostile reactions to me and had actually made very few comments, only responding to people who were confused or misunderstood and thus your accusations at that point in time were totally over the top and unfair and did not measure up to the evidence of my posts. Additionally, you are completely anonymous and not known by your real life identity, whereas I have spent most of my time on Wikipedia editing under my full name and am well known and you yourself have even commented about knowing my full name, so I find your comments and accusations defamatory to me in the real world. I feel you should agree to refactor your personal attacks against, not just myself, but others too, and I must therefore support previous requests for you to refactor these personal attacks and false accusations. Please also note that BLP applies to all pages on Wikipedia, not just to articles, Wikipedia:BLP#Non-article_space, and so if you persist in keeping your personal comments about me, a living, known and identifiable person, I must once again for the nth time insist that you provide verifiable proof supporting your allegations and accusations because you are in violation of BLP.

For Wakaouji, I explained when Takuto explained just after when Izumi tries to trick Mitsuki into jumping, he tells the doctor that he remembers the past and he was Route L's singer, and the agreement they made.

Under Madoka, it doesn't matter if two people audition with the same song. Eternal Song was planned as Madoka's debut single. Madoka's plan was that this way Full Moon wouldn't be able to sing the song at the same time, especially since they originally had the same producer. Since Mitsuki had her heart set on the song, she and Ooshige tried to get another producer. Eventually, under certain conditions, Wakaouji agrees to the job.

Also, in the anime, in one episode showing herself as a young child actress, she is shown to go through a lot before the anime began. Full Moon, on the other hand, rose to stardom with relatively little effort.",0

It might be possible to get permission, but there is no point in doing soa web site of this sort almost always is unsuitable for WP, because it is usually written as a press release, praising rather than describing the subject and containing material we would not include.

hey friday

while blocked the past two days i read through your subpages.   things like /admin etc.  they are great!

i'm burning out on this project  editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past i've received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me.   i also saw that i'm not the only one who's been on the receiving end of this.   i've seen it all but its too long to go into here.  i'm not sure if these are new trends or just something i haven't spent the time to look into before.  

""""mere editors"""" really have little recourse in this.   filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past.   it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an out-of-line editor.   filing against an admin would, i assume, be much, much worse.   admins seem to behave like inner-city police with their wall of silence.

a lot of your comments show that you've noticed the same happenings.  in an ideal world i think you are right  people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen.   i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies.   we need to define what something like """"disruption"""" is.   when someone is blocked for a personal attack, the diff should be included.   that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change; we've tried the """"trust admins to do what is right"""".   it has failed.

The interior of the fictional Masyaf citadel in Assassin's Creed contains an extensive library, and the rear is a lush garden above a sheer drop. These two properties happen to be known features of the real Alamut, which was also a Hashashin fortress at this time. Subsequently, it is likely that the fictional Masyaf is a combination of features of both fortresses.

It may also be the case that the in-game character Al-Mualim (""""teacher"""") is a portrayal of the real Rashid ad-Din Sinan, who was operating out of Masyaf at the time the game is set. Both characters are the leaders of the Masyaf citadel. In addition, both ad-Din Sinan and the fictional Al-Mualim die around the same point in time (e.g. 1192-4 compared to 1191). So there certainly are elements of the real Masyaf which have carried into the game, albeit modified. 

At any rate, a reference to Assassin's creed should only be made under the Popular Culture heading.   """,0

Controversy flaw
JBL using racial slurs isn't actually controversial. It's part of his gimmick. It shouldn't be part of the controversy section.  

JBL's racial slurs as part of his gimmick are controversial.  Just because they're scripted does not make them non-controversal.  Further, JBL's comments are controversal just as the Cryme Tyme gimick has been controversial, too.

The controversial section needs some cleaning up. Where's the objectivity? Most of it assumes him as racist by making no dissemination between his personal beliefs, and his gimmick.  

mess
i'm gonna clean up the last paragraph in the 2006 section, as it is written with alot of broken english that is difficult to understand.

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile;=THEAPA.jpg appears as red, the photo does not exist on the page 

 Judgment Day 
should it be noted under a trivia uestion that the last 3 years in a row JBL was in a main event match for a world title at Judgement day (04 he faced Eddie Guerrero, 05 he faced John Cena, and in 06 he faced Rey Mysterio)

 Anyone know the date of his WWF debut? 
The best I can find is December 1995 as John Hawk against Savio Vega (http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/95.htm). Is that right.@ 

 Nicknames 
Should a section be added with """"Wrestling God"""" put there? I'm not sure if he's had any other nicknames or if it's notable enough. But it would seem so, other articles (see Triple H) list them.  
I don't think we should. Triple H has had multiple nicknames, 3 of which he still uses. Layfield used only that one, he used it sparingly, he was almost never called """"Wrestling God"""" by other superstars or commentators, and he has not used it in years. ( )

 Powerbomb? 
I've never seen JBL do a powerbomb. Why is it listed? Because it's his finisher in SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007 or what?!  Emilos

Erased. 142.162.194.57

He did not wrestle though, he helped beat up Coach and Carlito. The match was just Hornswoggle vs. Coach and Carlito (it was no DQ, thats why the APA could interfere).  Spyke 
WWE.com announced his in-ring return.   

 Return To Active Duty 
It seems we've been entertaining a bit of looking into the crystal ball, here. JBL returns tonight on Smackdown, but until that show airs, it's not official unless it's properly referenced somewhere else (WWE.com or another reliable source).   

 Well this ultimately proved to be false... 
In """"Semi-Retirement / WWE Commentator (2006-2007)""""...

""""Layfield noted in a recent commentary on TheStreet.com that he was retiring from in-ring competition for good...""""

""""A broken back suffered in a match in England, compounded by a herniated and bulged disc, finally made me realize my career as a professional wrestler was over.""""

Yet he returns a year and a half later

Alright,  through all of the various discussions on various article:talk pages, AN/I, and user talk pages I see so many different conversations.  Well, people keep saying that I could use a mentor.  That I have turned it down.  Guess what, look at my userpage, I have asked for one and still ask for one.  .  It has also been stated I keep using non RS.  If you look here, I state that when a source is stated to be non-RS I never use it again.   I saw that Niteshift went to RS/N to identify usadojo and ashidakim as non/RS. I never used those sources again. I used RS/N to identify if boxrec and judoinsider are reliable sources (although I don't have a reliable answer).  I primarily just use Google news and google books, but user 82 or maybe niteshift (I am unsure which one) stated that even books on that might not be considered to be RS such as  written by Al Gotay because they are written by him are unreliable (when I was only using them as an example of books he wrote for his own notability as an author).  Again, I don't work for wikipedia or any organization that wants to have articles up.   What I do here is volunteer my time to disseminate information (I was trying to work within the guidelines).

I will make an admission, I am an urban male of color from an urban environment.  For the most part, I am writing for a specific audience.  I don't expect individuals who are from different environments to see the world in the same way I do.  People like Marcus Garvey or Buffalo Soldier's may not be important to the general American but are pretty important to  those in the African American community.  WP:WORLDVIEW.  Dutty Boukman is important in the history of Haiti and the African diaspora, but an unknown when it comes to the majority of the  anglo world.   It is difficult to find information from mainstream media sources on minorities on many important figures.  Think about how hard it is to find information on historical individuals such as Malcolm X, Frederick Douglass, George Washington Carver on BBC News, Time Magazine or Newsweek.  You may find some information on Ebony Magazine, Essence or Jet Magazine.  Think about how hard it is to find moderately notable figures as shown here.    The use of blogs  and indb   does highlight some individuals but wouldn't be considered to be a reliable source.  So how can I find online sources? Printed sources I know can be used, but if people can't see the books there is little in the way of Verifiability.   Thus we have issues like Basile Croquère  and George Cofield and listed in  black heroes in the martial arts  not having a wikipedia page.  Jose Landi was deleted in March 2014 and later speedily deleted when I tried to recreate it.  This forced me to have to take it to DRV to have it recreated.  This is for an individual who is considered to be a top 10 black martial artist in the history of MMA.     

Fact remains blacks and latinos make up about 80 million people in the United States.  About 1/4 of the population  but many important individuals in their history is underrepresented on wikipedia.
Call me an idealist, as I have read about the decline of wikipedia from how newer users are treated  , male oriented with a western bias  .

Again from the Duel books pushing what was a politically driven firing trial in order to prove the quality of the armored plate.

Evidence provided by Carey Erickson concludes that the tests were politically motivated to artificially bolster the performance of the US 76mm gun over the 17 pounder gun which was unfairly  marginalized during the tests the Panthers themselves according to the researcher had significant battle damage (burned out, multiple hits, to front plate ,etc.) or were hit many times to lower the plate resistance before the tests were recorded. 

small excerpt:
  Panther Ausf. A tank labeled as No. 1 listed as having a good quality plate was in reality was face hardened (a curious rarity at this point of the war) and took 9 rounds to weaken the plate enough to allow penetration. Evidence also shows that the Panther tank No. 3 had serious battle damage before being subjected to the firing tests which should have excluded it from being tested in the first place. 

Therefore these tests are not an indication of poor quality Panther plate but rather an indication of the politics at the time I suggest a removal or an amendment informing the reader to the nature of the political nature of the tests.",0

You can't have it both ways. You're either an encyclopedic website that seeks to be factual and informative while minimizing speculation or you're a fansite. Either way, it's not suitable for inclusion. For example, if your site is a community run information site, then it should not be included under the In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose guideline. Your Wiki won't provide information we don't already have or will have in the future if its just a community info site. However, if it trades in information that we won't be adding, such as speculation, theories, spoilers, because of Wikipedia guidelines on such material, then we should not be posting your sites for the reasons discussed above. It is not the case of making a link between encyclopedias, but between an encyclopedia and one particular fansite.
Further, the two Wikis you mention aren't even major fansites, when the guideline specifically states: Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. We already have the major AND official forum: The Fuselage. If you'd like to add a link to a directory of Lost fansites, be my guest... but inclusion of either Wiki alone (instead of a list) is preferential treatment of minor fansites, since there are certainly other, larger, more popular fansites (Lost-media, Lost-tv, for example). Certainly, if we were to start adding fansites at random, we'd have to begin there and with others, like a link to TWOP's reviews and forums. The best course of action if you believe these sites simply must be linked to is for you to make a list of fansites and include a link to that directory, which is how WP:EL says to proceed.
As for removing the disclaimer, its not going anywhere. The disclaimer was put there specifically because we'd have people posting each and every fansite they dreamed up as official sites when they weren't. Lost is an example of a show wherein Wikipedia guidelines and policies are repeatedly ignored by the editing community, so the long-term editors have had to be very diligent in monitoring this page. This is an outgrowth of that, and has for the most part helped a lot. Moreover, there is no """"freebie"""" section for links. All links listed there are official sources except IMDB, which is used almost without exception. The same list of reasons I mentioned above for IMDB, including the fact that IMDB is a featured part of the standard TV Infobox, clearly do not apply to these Wikis nor any other site people have been trying to add (Mr. Clucks, 4815162342, etc.)
Finally, I will agree with you that the list of links for all the individual networks is redundant, and should be chopped down or moved to Airdates of Lost as a link for the country/network listed there.  """,0

Stlemur if you really want all the nitty gritty information of Glitters case, then why don't you do what was suggested at the start of this debate and do a full court record of Glitter's trial. This is an article about Gary Glitter, the singer. While it will of course mention details about the case, it is not a case of doing it to the degree that every stone, regardless of how pointless be turned.

"Response
So  I'm sure you're a really nice guy, but it looks like you're adding the tags not because of the the article needing a cleanup and reorganizing but just because the color scheme of the column boxes are not the color scheme of original boxes and are matching the Roc Nation colors and of the logo.

That is just plain out bias it not my fault that other people do not do this when creating a record label studio album discography, which they can and you have not seen one with a color scheme on them. All I have done is put the 3 basic colors Black, Red and White of Roc Nation on a original Wikipedia column to distinguish it from other record label albums discography and the other names of the artists that are on the article, because the article would grow as those and more artist release more studio albums and mixtapes, which makes it appropriate and not inappropriate as you have stated for you reason of adding cleanup/reorganize tags. Once again all I did is add 3 basic colors to the original columns Black, Red and White which anybody can do on any other record label discographies on Wikipedia, but I may have been the first to do this new color scheme styling of a record label studio album discography that does not mean you just add tags that are not meant to be on a specific article that is formatted, organized and written like any other record label albums discographies on Wikipedia and is fully verified.

There is no Wikipedia rule that says this is not justified for a record label studio album discography except for you , I'm sure you're a really nice guy, but this just plain bias, which Wikipedia does not condone from established editors or administrators.",0

 Traces to the person who leaked the photos of Deathly Hallows 

It seems, that the pictures leaked on the internet help the investigators, because metadata saved in the pictures reveal more information. Also other aspects can help to identify the person.
See this article: http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2104250.ece ( )
This could be getting to the point where there should be a separate article entirely that traces the story of this particular Harry Potter leak, considering it has led to sustained press coverage and lawsuits.  As this seems to be the only full leak of the entire book, negating the need for disambig, perhaps it should simply be entitled Leak of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  
Try not to get ensnared in recentism. While there is still a ton of documentation, there isn't an enormous amount of unique information. We should wait a bit, see if it can't be condensed, and then consider a split.- 
Yeah, I agree with that.  Only if it gets to the point where further legal action is taken or if this person's identity is discovered.  

If there is enough information, this would be an interesting article, but it should report the story of the leak from the beginning to the ending - if there will be one ;) - and background information. It would also shorten the hole article Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows there should be a section where a few sentences describe what happened and then above """"Main Article: Leak of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"""". But I agree with Wafulz, that we should wait.  

 Dealing with inevitable spoilers 

We need a hideable section template.  That way people can post the plot details, but have them hidden by default so people don't have to read them if they don't want to.  (Talk  Contrib) 

Trust me, you don't want to get involved in this type of spoiler discussion. It has resulted in months of arguments on Wikipedia:Spoiler, several Requests for comment, and a requested arbitration case.- 

I think, plot details shouldn't be revealed before the book is officialy released. Wikipedia shouldn't spread illegaly gotten information.  

Considering that some people have quite legally obtained the book before its """"official"""" release, not all the """"spoilers"""" are """"illegally gotten infomation"""".  Perhaps you should put a bit more thought into your comments before you make a blanket statment implying that a large amount of your fellow Wiki editors are criminals.   

No one is advocating that.  T/C 

This might be an idea you could pursue as a broader guideline if you really felt strongly about it but I don't think it should be used in this setting because all of the other Harry Potter book articles simply have a first section titled """"Plot overview"""".

Traditionally, Canada's Aboriginal peoples hold that they have resided on their lands since the beginning of time, while archaeological studies support a human presence in the northern Yukon from 26,500 years ago, and in southern Ontario from 9,500 years ago. The first Europeans to arrive were the Vikings, who settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows around 1000 AD, after which there was no further trans-Atlantic contact until John Cabot explored Canada's east coast for England in 1497, followed by French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1534. In the early 17th century, Samuel de Champlain founded the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal and Quebec City, from which the French colonists extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and the present-day Maritimes, while French fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.

Due to the close proximity of these two European powers, a series of wars over both territory and the fur trade errupted between 1689 and 1763, such as the French and Iroquois Wars, the four Intercolonial Wars, and the Seven Years' War. Via the peace treaties that concluded these conflicts, Acadia and most of New France was ceeded to Britain, which then, through the 1763 Royal Proclamation, carved the Province of Quebec out of New France, annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia, and placed all the former French territories under common law; six years later, St. John's Island became a separate colony. By 1774, the Quebec Act reestablished civil law in Quebec and reaffirmed the right of its population to practice their Catholic faith, as well as expanding the province's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, all of which helped to fuel the American Revolution. From that conflict, some 50,000 persons loyal to the Crown fled to Canada, where new regions were created to accomodate them: New Brunswick was split from Nova Scotia, and Quebec was divided into Upper an",0

 POV 
I removed:

""""Many fewer would have been shot down if not for poor planning and inflexibility by the mission planners of Strategic Air Command. Specifically, SAC ordered B-52s to attack from highly predictable, precisely-timed, repetitive positions and altitudes. This eliminated the element of surprise. The NVA were able to aim their Soviet-built SA-2 Guideline Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) by simple timing and azimuth prediction. Further complicating the situation for the B-52s was the fact that SAC had used the same jamming (electronic countermeasures) techniques for years, thus enabling the NVA to develop counter-countermeasures.

SAC ordered the B-52s to make a steep turn after dropping the bombs. This resulted in an interruption in the electronic jamming of NVA radars because the B-52s' jamming antennas, which were located on the bottom of the aircraft, were then pointed away from the radars. To make matters worse, the turn made the B-52s face into a 100-mph headwind, which slowed their escape. The NVA were surprised at first, but after a few nights of these repetitive tactics, they figured it out. The NVA blasted several B-52s with direct hits. Two were damaged severely and crashed near U-Tapao Royal Thai Air Force Base. The situation would have been even worse for the B-52s if not for the inaccuracy of the SA-2 system and the inexperience and errors of its NVA operators.

SAC refused to change its tactics even when shown that the existing tactics were ineffective and highly dangerous to the aircraft and crews. In part, this was due to indecision on the part of SAC's commander. Also, because of a """"top-down"""" culture which had been originally established for nuclear war by General LeMay refused to listen to the suggestions of its aircrews. The LeMay culture had discouraged open and frank discussion to the point that only """"yes men"""" made it to the top of the SAC organization where, potentially, they might have been able to prod the SAC commander into a change of tactics. (Surprisingly, NVA records and interviews with former SAM operators show exactly the opposite culture. Realistic discussion and innovation were encouraged among the batteries' commanders.)

Ironically, although the NVA had run out of missiles by Day Four of the campaign, and the B-52s could have bombed an undefended Hanoi, SAC was so rattled by its losses that it directed the B-52s to targets outside Hanoi, thus giving the NVA time to reload. After that, B-52 losses mounted again.

SAC commanders did their best to suppress revelations about their incompetence, even going so far as to suggest that one of their critics was mentally unstable. SAC has rewritten history in its official account of Linebacker II. This semi-fiction is still taught at the USAF's Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.""""

"Hey Sue, How are u. from u know who

Hey Sue Anne, how are you?

Hope you are as fine as always.

Looks like the petty cabal has been upto something on my IP userpage. LOL.

Some of the cabal must have jumped in, looking at the edit history, maybe because they were smarting when I pointed out their ways. LOL. I feel bad for them, they must have been nursing their grudges for long. LOL.

Your message in my support and other messages have been deviously deleted by one of the cabal. LOL.
Would you be bothered enough to put it in place again?
The cabal obviously want to paint the issue their way. HAHAHAHAHA.

I did not read a single message on my usertalk page after your nice supportive message because I already knew it must be full of the cabal's unmentionable things. LOL. I only noted the names of the cabal and had a big laugh.

A few things did come out of the incident.

Crossmr meekly submitted that he had not blocked me.
He further admitted in so many of his own words that he had not even read the message Vesther had sent me to which I had replied, and that he had no idea about the issue, but he still sent me 1 warning and 1 message, LOL. Even after warning me and sending me another message, he did not have any idea about the issue and had not read about the issue at all!!! LOL.
He further did not even warn Vesther, but he warned me for using those words, Vesthers words, which I only used to reply to him in his own medicine.!!! LOL.

So, the result is that Crossmr has succeeded in showing himself to be UNFAIR, BIASED and grossly INCOMPETENT to be an admin. Who makes these guys admins??? LOL.

As for Mr. Royboy, LOL. The less said about him the better. LOL. HAHAHAHAHA.
Who made this guy admin? Where did he come from? Who IS he?
What explanation did he give for blocking AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME?
Me and Crossmr were just talking about his warning, which u know by now was totally wrong and biased, he was not even aware of the issue and gave an excuse of tralala, which Vesther had used!!!, and this guy turns up from nowhere?
It was a total and absolute DISGRACEFUL abuse of admin priveleges. Too bad I foiled it.
I guess he only knows how to block people without reading a single word of what people write or even understanding the issue. I sympathize with his condition.

Some people do get obsessed and have control issues with wiki I guess, Vesther being a case in point.
Is it possible that this guys a friend or a sock-puppet of an earlier aggrieved cabal member? LOL.

Anyway, the above two examples are on record, and you are the witness!!! 
And I hope next time you act strongly and correctively on such issues, I mean un-blocking.

I guess this petty cabal must have been going about this, just block, without any warning to block, and without understanding or reading anything about it, with other people, before they came across someone like me, LOL. And after that they try and make excuses and dig up old irrelevant issues which they couldnt muster up before that, as excuses. They must be quite experienced in trying to obfuscate the SPECIFIC ISSUE IN QUESTION later on. LOL.

I sincerely think that you should have exercised your right to unblock, seeing how u understood the issue, and the concerned admin or admins had no expanation for the block.

No reading, no understanding of the specific issue, no warning to the original guilty party, no warning to block, just block!!!! LOL.

But Now, they will think hard before going on about their murky ways.
LOL.

So, by extrapolating this, I have come to the conclusion that wiki is seriously and morally challenged and also lacks in competence. LOL.

All the more reason its needs me. LOL.

I wont let you down wiki. LOL.

Of course, there must be many good decent admins like you.

A few words about my messages I had sent.

With regard to Vesther, we both know what I feel about him. HAHAHAHAHA. LOL.
But to be fair, its not his fault really. Its the incompetent power-mad admin's fault who probably hit buttons from a list before even reading the messages of both parties. LOL.

Vesther just couldnt take it I guess after I repied back, giving him some of his own medicine, he just started crying. LOL. I guess he's not used to it. Maybe till now people just got bored of his obsessive ways and ignored him. LOL. Too bad. I see he has been receiving some much needed counselling from his best friend Crossmr who Did Not give him a warning for the very same words. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

The police, court system, and at least one defense attorney for the attackers all said the attacks were a deliberate attempt to attack people the attackers thought were gay.  Nowhere in the article does it say that Mr. Button is gay; the article says the attackers knew nothing about Mr. Button's sexuality and that the victims of the attacks targeted at random simply because they were in an area of Central Park where the attackers believed gay people congregated.

 Understanding how Wikipedia does things 

Hello Mike, I see you have some concerns about the article. First off, I want to note that this is exactly why we always tell people don't try to write your own article on Wikipedia. I was willing to write one for you because I think you're an interesting subject, but you really need to stop trying to work on your own article. It is absolutely impossible for you to be objective about your own work, and also you keep trying to make edits which are not properly sourced. To answer a few points:

Why are the links to the National Traditional Country Music Association pages and the Library of Congress Recorded Sound Reference Center underlined in red as non-existent? These sites do exist.  They are non-existed on Wikipedia; we aren't saying they're non-existent in general, just that nobody has written an article about them here yet. The red means """"someone should write an article about them"""". Before they were blue because you were re-routing the link to go to their own homepage, but we don't allow such external links to be used in the middle of the page like that, and also because that obscures the fact that we need somebody to write those articles.
 Regarding your nickname: if you say Plantenga is wrong, I've removed the nickname. However, you cannot simply go and fill in whatever nickname you want in its place, unless you have a clearly cited source.
 You really need to read our guideline/warning WP:Autobiography to understand exactly why you shouldn't be messing with your biography. You should not be making any edits on that page except to remove blatant vandalism. Again, you are literally the last person on earth who should be editing your own biography on Wikipedia, because doing so compromises the neutrality of the project.
 Lastly, I really suggest you read WP:Verifiability, not truth. The long/short is that a given fact is only useful if it can be cited to a good source, and no matter how true a fact is, it's no good on an encyclopedia without citation. So while we of course recognize that in the larger world, accuracy is the goal, on an encyclopedia our concern is how documentable a fact is. So on a certain level, we literally don't care whether a fact in Plantenga's book or in a Washington Post article is completely accurate, we care that it's clearly documented. Whereas if you make """"corrections"""" based on your personal knowledge, that just makes the article weaker because each such edit decreases its Verifiability.

At this point, you really need to just accept that you have a biography on Wikipedia, and it's sourced to published works, and be (moderately) happy with that. Wikipedia is absolutely not here for you to """"get the rest of the story out"""", or """"build your brand"""" or whatnot, we're just here to compile and organize information that has already been published by neutral experts. So please refrain from trying to edit your own article, it always ends badly and wastes time for everyone involved to have to change things back and forth, and just trust the Wikipedia community to do our best to keep things running smoothly.

If the Scorecard was indeed arbitrary or advancing an agenda, I think you'd have a strong point, but it is based on a very specific set of objective criteria which is evenly applied from state to state.

"P.S. On further reflection, I see that there is at least one point that I clearly overstated in our discussion. Sources for 2000s (decade) do not, in fact, have to be explicitly about the decade. They can be about, say, events that happened at some point during the decade. For example, a retrospective source about the 21st century, published before 2010, almost certainly is acceptable as a source about the 2000s. It is, after all, from these types of sources that time lines are constructed. Beneath my cynical tone (as it strikes me now in retrospect) was the idea that one can't infer too much from sources, as such inference might amount to original research. If a source says that X is characteristic of the 21st century or of modernity in general, that source (at least in principle) certainly may be used to help put the 2010s decade (insofar as it is part of the 21st century and of modernity) into context. Statement X just shouldn't be used clearly to characterize item A on Wikipedia, when it clearly is meant to characterize item B in the source.

No, Ketuanan Melayu was NEVER mentioned in the Constitution. It only mentions about """"Hak Keistimewaan orang Melayu"""". This is nothing but just the mentioned """"Aborigin Rights"""" just like most other countries, like Canada and Singapore. """"Ketuanan Melayu"""" was invented, but I'm not sure when is it exactly that it was first being used. One may say it is a derivation from the Article 153, but it has gone too far from beneficial - it has been abused and being used as a tool by Barisan Nasional for their own gain. The rationale behind Hak Keistimewaan Orang Melayu is that what they claimed that Malays are the Aborigins (although I don't really agree with this, the Peranakans has settled in Malacca during the 15th centuries!) - the true Aborigins are none other than Orang Aslis. Let's assume that the fact that Malays are aborigins are true. Article 153 never introduced """"Malays First"""" Policy, but rather the means to protect Malay rights as well as the rights of other races in this country. Article 153 is never controversial, but rather being ABUSED by certain politicians. I hope these makes it clear. The most prominent example that happens in this country right now is the government scholarship. You can read almost everywhere about this. Isn't this already an official discrimination? You can read more like the BTN courses who always refers the Chinese (include Peranakan generations) and Indians as """"pendatang"""", but the fact is that Parameswara himself is a Pendatang, (and also Khir Toyo).

Although Malaysia is not officially an Enthnocracy, but we can see that Malaysia appears to be one. Enthocracy is not limited to particular race in government positions, but it refers also to racial policies and practises. The definition of Ethnocracy includes """"and use them to advance the position of their particular ethnic group(s) to the detriment of others"""". Under the Malays First Policy (NEP, MARA, and many more) this is indeed very clear without further elaboration.

Ok, I've looked at Hanged, drawn and quartered (ugh!), and  similarly pointed me to Marco Polo, and I think I'm getting it now - bear with me, my head's been this shape for a long time now! That is, I can see that one could feel a bit overwhelmed by some of the refs in Reculver, as there's so much in them. That's something that I'm used to and comfortable with, but I suppose the point is that it could be well outside many readers' comfort zones? So, I think I'm convinced. Which means that now, it's me that's intimidated - by the coding I'll have to learn, and the scale of the task! I think this is partly why I let it slide, when Chzz first suggested it. To be honest, I think I feel a little like MF these days - though I have put a lot of effort into some articles in the past, I've wanted to back away from the friction that often arises in WP; but sometimes I'll still get involved - popping up here asking for help with Reculver was spurred by an accidental urge to buff up Walkington Wold burials, which came over me only in the last couple of days - and so I'd like to use that to get obscure, remote, yet historically fascinating Reculver up to GA, in case I never feel the urge again.
In view of which, I think I'll tinker with the """"tentative experiment"""" in the Reculver article in the next day or two, to straighten it out, and to explore what needs to be done.

 Neo-Nazis on Wikipedia  

With so much information online, there is a big need for encyclopedias. Wikipedia is not the answer.  Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia’s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.  

Wikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.

The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text """"military salute became the Nazi salute.""""

Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. """"  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” 

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""  

Recently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the """"Roman salute"""" article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry's discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America."""" Wikipedia liars also used the painting """"The Oath of the Horatii"""" as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.

Similar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.

Wikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer """"public schools"""" when they mean """"government schools"""" and they both cover-up the Bellamys' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called """"military socialism"""") within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.

Some regular writers on Wikipedia knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of",0

"Another issue / suggestion 

I noticed another issue that I guess it's not listed anywhere: when some articles start getting big and full of information, wikipedia users refrain from deleting weak or even nonsense parts. They believe it's good to keep all that (useless?) stuff, probably reasoning that some information is better than none. That's why many many articles get huge and are tagged to need the attention of an expert (who would hopefully clean up all the junk).

I strongly disagree with this behavior of keeping junk on the main page. I guess the editing system should allow two versions of an article: the main one, with the information that was agreed by everyone (intersection of information) and another, longer one with all the possible information for that subject (union of information). In this way people would not be so afraid of deleting junk because it would be stored on the second page, and the main article would always be a cleaned up version, which, if not complete, at least would not fail on quality.",0

These actions(in bold) were done by the author of the wikipedia page instead of showing commentary or actions of spike lee and the issues involved.

Attachment theory
Hello, I've noticed the general subject are of your edits and wondered if you might want to look at my new article Attachment theory and give it your touch - don't know if it is something you know about.

Also, as I happened to look at your contribs I saw you had done some work on brain imaging.  I've been wondering recently about why it is that we routinely X-ray people for internal physical problems but rarely brain scan people with behavioural difficulties or mental illness.  Am I right in assuming it's largely a matter of cost?  

As a sufferer of mental illness (clinical depression and with a bipolar family member) it would almost be a relief to me to be able to see something on a picture and go """"there, that's why I'm different"""".  Of course, I realise little is understood - but that would improve if imaging of ill people were widespread. 

Would appreciate any insights you might have.  » .....TALKQuietly)]] 13:48, Aug 8, 2004 (UTC)""",0

One was the popular girls group, and the other was the unpopular girls group. You may think that I would at least have fitted into the unpopular girls group, but I didn't. They locked me out of their little group and wouldn't even talk to me. They teased me mercelessly and so did the popular girls group. I never got invited to any parties after 2nd grade; I never had any friends. The boys basically ignored me (until 7th grade when THEY were the ones who teased me mercelessly), while they flirted with the other girls. All the other girls would talk about was boys (when they weren't bragging to each other about thier home life). They never let me play with them, and the teacher didn't make them include me. In lunch and recess I would just sit alone or cry alone. In 6th grade one of the kids told the teacher to throw me out the window. The teacher just shook his head.

7. I think the version where it has previews came out May 1986, the version with no previews and FBI warnings fading came out October 1986 because it was still in progression of editing, the version where the FBI warnings slideshow came out December 1986 because DSAS: vol.2 came out that day, meaning that version with the red FBI warnings and the VDA came out January 1987.

Non-free content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose.
No free equivalent could be created to show what Berry looked like as a webcam pornographer at 16 or so no matter how we approach him as a 22-year-old anti-child pornography speaker & educator.

The only way I could see to accomplish that with this photograph would be to ask Berry to permit its release under GFDL.  Permission would be impossible to obtain and it would be (to my mind) cruel even to ask Berry about it.
Non-free content is always replaced with a freer alternative if one of acceptable quality is available. """"Acceptable quality"""" means a quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose.
There is no freer equivalent available  Berry will never be a teenager again, and, since his appearance as a teenager is one of the issues raised by his critics, letting the reader draw their own conclusion seems more prudent & more neutral than telling them one way or the other what to think.
As a quick test, ask yourself: """"Can this image be replaced by a different one, while still having the same effect?"""" If the answer is yes, then the image probably does not meet this criterion.
As the effect is inextricably tied to the age of the subject as depicted on the websites he administered, there is nothing that would have the same effect as depicting him as others saw him at the time.  It is intrinsically true that Berry portrayed himself a particular way when operating his websites.  The only neutrality we can have on the subject is to show the """"facts""""  Berry's image then  and let the reader draw their own conclusion.

 Land Day   /Jewish Exodus    

The background of the former is completely skewed, as you note. The latter article is premised on a wholly ideological POV attempt to establish a symmetry between the expulsion of Palestinians, and the far more, and much later (generally) exodus of Jewish communities from the Arab world. The Arabs did not encourage Palestinians to leave. Zionists strongly encouraged the Jewish diaspora in the Arab world to make aliyah. As it stands, of all I/P articles, the Jewish exodus registers as the one which narrates almost exclusively an Israeli/Zionist POV. Quite remarkable. This is how Shlomo Ben-Ami puts it, in his review of .

In October of that year, on the eve of Operation Hiram, which led to the expulsion of many of the Arabs of the northern Galilee region, Ben-Gurion declared, """"The Arabs of the Land of Israel have only one function left to them  to run away."""" And they did; panic-stricken, they fled in the face of massacres in Ein Zeitun and Eilabun, just as they had done in the wake of an earlier massacre in Deir Yassin. Operational orders, such as the instruction from Moshe Carmel, the Israeli commander of the northern front, """"to attack in order to conquer, to kill among the men, to destroy and burn the villages,"""" were carved into the collective memory of the Palestinians, spawning hatred and resentment for generations. 

There are only two points on which Morris' splendid analysis falters. He is unconvincing in his attempt to pardon some of Israel's original sins by creating an awkward symmetry between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced emigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries and Iran, which Morris quotes Israeli leaders as calling """"an unplanned 'exchange of population.'"""" Regimes hostile to Israel were not alone in getting Jews to leave; envoys from the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, and from the Jewish Agency were working underground in several Middle Eastern countries to encourage Jews to go to Israel. More important, for many Jews in the region, the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the culmination of millenarian dreams. It represented the consummation of a quest to take part in Israel's resurgence as a nation. No matter how painful the memory of their eviction or how humiliating their second-class status in Israel, these new Israelis never sought to return to their lands of origin. By contrast, the Palestinian refugees were forced into the wilderness of exile with no guarantee of a new national home and no prospect of returning to their native land. The yearning for return thus became the Palestinians' defining national ethos. 
Morris' characterization of the conflict of 1948 as an Islamic jihad against Jewish-Western infidels in Palestine is also unpersuasive. It is true that the figurehead of Palestinian nationalism at the time was the fanatically religious and viscerally anti-Semitic mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. And Arab discourse during 1948 was occasionally peppered with the rhetoric of holy war: the Syrian author Vadi'a Talhuq's book A New Crusade in Palestine, published on the eve of the Arab invasion, compared the war to the liberation of Palestine from the crusaders. Yet Israel in 1948 was no tool of the West. On the contrary, it could not have won the war without arms shipments from the Soviet bloc. The socialist nature of Israeli society at the time prompted Egypt's prime minister, Mahmud al-Nuqrashi, to define Israel as an agent of """"atheism and nihilist Communism."""" And the Zionists' Arab enemies were hardly under the control of Islamic movements. They were all ruled by decadent conservative elites who paid nothing more than lip service to Islamic values and the religious hysteria on the Arab street. Broadcasters and agitators rallied the masses under the banner of a holy war against the nascent Jewish state. But the Muslim Brotherhood sent only one battalion to fight in Palestine. It was ill-trained conventional armies, not Hezbollah-style guerrilla units, that led the Arab assault in 1948. After the defeat, rather than pursuing jihad against Israel, the conservative Arab regimes signed an armistice agreement granting legitimacy to Israel's 1948 borders. And between 1949 and 1952, they all attempted to reach permanent peace agreements with the Jewish state.  Shlomo Ben-Ami A War to Start All Wars, Foreign Affairs, September/October 2008.

It is my belief that I misrepresented the work done to regain Featured Topic status at a time when one last article was needed.  It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system. You noted that this type of credit was dangerous territory for the cup.  Clearly, just having articles added to a topic or repromoting a deleted topic could be gaming the system, but when a rule change requires taking a 17-article topic from 1/3rd  to 1/2 Featured content, it is not a matter of gaming the system.

The winner of this contest could come down to whether you grant me Featured Topic points for Wikipedia:Featured topics/Millennium Park. I earned FT points for this topic when it was first promoted.  At that time the topic was 15 articles and the requirement was that 1/3 of the articles be WP:FC and all be at least WP:GA.  Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 15 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 17 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.

 excessively long / appositive commaS 

This article is excessively long. It has far too much material about Gregory's father Thomas, who is of course the subject of a separate major article. 

The writer of this article also makes the repeated grammatical mistake of omitting the necessary second comma in appositive phrases such as """"his father, Thomas was a powerful man"""".

"Regarding workstations, servers and mainframes 

I believe that workstations and servers are classes of computers, not sizes.

For example, consider the IBM Power 595. It is a server, is it not? From the page, IBM seems to think so, and it certainly fits the definition of a server, with that being a computer that provides a service(s) to client(s). Now, consider the IBM Power 520. This too is a server, is it  not? IBM thinks so, and it fits the definition.

However, the Power 595 is not a desktop. It is nowhere near a desktop. It is a rackmount (IBM-speak: framemount) server, as evidenced by its dimensions: (201.4 cm x 77.5 cm x 180.6 cm); and weight: (1,552 kg). I will personally give anyone who can fit this on an average office desk from Ikea, a cookie.

Now, the Power 520 is not a rackmount server. It is nowhere near a rackmount server. It is a deskside server, as evidenced by its dimensions: (540 mm x 182-328 mm x 628 mm); and weight: (40.8 kg). I will personally give anyone who can convince a Fortune 500 company that the Power 520 is a top-of-the-line rackmount server, a cookie.

Two very different machines, both in hardware and form factor, but they are still both classed as a server. Clearly, as evidenced by this, servers can be in many form factors. A server can be a desktop, but it is not exclusively a desktop. How the article is currently written seems to suggest that it is. A server can also be a rackmount, a tower, a blade, a deskside and a pedestal, to name a few.

Workstations also come in more form factors than just desktop. Many servers are desktops (as in horizontal) and are small and light enough to be placed on a desk (the second, more historical definition of a desktop). However, they can also be in a deskside, tower, rackmountable or pedestal form factor, just to name a few.

This can be remedied by not using classes to determine size. Instead, use form factors such as blade, rackmount, deskside, etc.",0

 Wondering If You Could Help... 

A couple of months ago, I created a page for the """"Original"""" Clark Sisters, an American close-harmony singing group from the 1930s and '40s, that was fairly well-known at the time.  As an announcer at a Jazz radio station, includng being the host of a """"Trad Jazz"""" show, I have some pretty extensive knowledge of this genre of music.  I properly referenced the article, and provided appropriate links to and from other related pages.  All in all, I think I did a fairly good job, considering it was only my first real page construction.  

So, along comes this editor from the U.K., (""""Seddon""""), and marks the thing for """"speedy deletion"""".  Before I can even find out about it, the page is gone.  Then, when I try to ask him about it by posting on his talk page, he totally ignores me.  In the first place, I can't understand how a U.K. editor is even ALLOWED to edit a piece on U.S. music; secondly, if he is allowed, why is he allowed to place his questionable judgment above mine?  I am hoping that you can help me restore the page, so that I don't have to go to all the trouble of re-creating it, at a loss of several hours of my time.

I'm also wondering about the procedure for filing a complaint against an editor.  It seems to me that his behavior in this matter has not been appropriate, and I wonder if there is any forum that I can take my complaints to?

Thanks for your time.

Ok I'm going to reproduce part of my page here again to close this matter. Censoring images in any way is against Wikipedia policies. Any questions? Compromises on Wikipedia policies is not allowed, needless to say. Please stay firm with people who attempt to violate Wikipedia policies.  (talk•contribs) 

How Wikipedia policies/guidelines may apply to issue of Muhammad's pictures

Wikipedia:Profanity
Words and images that would be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by typical Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternatives are available. Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not.

Some editors argue that in the light of this guideline:
 Typical Wikipedia readers do not find pictures of Muhammad offensive
 Exclusion of such pictures would result in the article being less informative, relevant and accurate.
 No suitable alternatives are available, as these pictures are historic
 As the policy states, """"Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not."""". Therefore, the primary mission of Wikipedia and its editors is to improve articles so they are more informative. Being offensive is not Wikipedia's mission.
 In addition, there are no issues of copyrights as the copyrights for all these pictures have expired so the images can be used freely where relevant.

WP:NOT#CENSORED
This policy states:
 Wikipedia may contain content that some readers consider objectionable or offensive.
 Wikipedia cannot guarantee that articles or images are tasteful to all users or adhere to specific social or religious norms or requirements.

Printing Images of Muhammad: A minority tradition?
Some users (Itaqallah and ALM) have suggested that since printing of Muhammad's images has , therefore Wikipedia too should not print the images otherwise it will be a violation of WP:UNDUE. Cartoon images of Muhammad have been printed all over the World and this is not likely to change now:

Hi there. Not wanting to start a war over this. This stub is very vague and I was attempting to add some clarity to it. Because it now reads: """"martyred"""" and """"mostly Roman Catholics and Chinese"""" and it is not a neutral point of view. """"...other churches recognized their own martyrs"""" implies that the others who were killed for their faith were not part of """"THE Chines Martyrs"""". The fact that they are accepted as """"martyrs"""" by the Roman church does not make them """"martyrs"""" in the Orthodox or even the Protestant sense. So, since the meager content of this stub is mostly about the Roman Catholic individuals who were cannonized, it is appropriate to divide things and qualify things as I had done. There are undoubtably many who will oppose the term """"Martyrs"""" itself in the title because of the modern cultural connotations that it carries like """"Martyrs of Sept. 11 (hijackers)...But it does work if this article is limited to the Papal decree that popularized a phrase - if that is what it is.

Hello.  To Jeffro77 above...  The original and first reference that I put in was Thomas Cahill, and his book The Gifts of the Jews - How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels.   And I originally put that ref alone.  The Wilson ref came later on, from a search, and at the request of Jeppiz.   But Cahill alone I felt was overall sufficient at that point.  (And that Cahill book had literally zero to do with anything with Jehovah’s witnesses, or any JW books or journals or sermons.)    That wasn’t even on my mind in that sense, nor did I look at ANY Watchtower publications regarding this article or this specific matter.  Cahill had nothing to do with that.       And even Jeppiz admitted a number of times that it was a reliable source and ok.       But the Wilson source I provided here later on (and then soon on the article itself) was only at the demand of Jeppiz, for another source.   He kept insisting to find something else, etc, so I did a search, and the Wilson thing was even more pointed in a way, and it’s in a pro-JW website, “strictly genteel”, which transcribed the noted WT book “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?”, and the link can be found here http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/wordofgod/wordofgod4.html.       (Also, to DougWeller, hello.   I’m still not sure why you say that I got the name of the book wrong.   That’s what’s stated as the source.    J.A. Wilson.   And “The World History of the Jewish People”.   At least that’s he main part of the name of the book, and I believe Wilson was a co-author of that or something.)    But, to Jeffro, you seem to think (incorrectly) that I probably had the Wilson ref as paramount, when in actuality that was just a side thing and accident, because of subsequent demands and circumstances on this Talk page.   Cahill was actually my guy on this specific matter on the Exodus matter, NOT Wilson necessarily nearly as much.      The exact (in-context) quote from Cahill’s book says this:   

“When we examine the considerable extant literatures of Mesopotamia and Egypt, we find no obvious mention of the Israelites.  If, as the majority of scholars have provisionally concluded, Israel escaped from Egypt in the reign of Rameses II about midway through the thirteenth century B.C., why is there no record of this marvellous defeat in any Egyptian text or inscription?   Of course, the defeat may have been so embarrassing to Egypt that, like many great powers, it could not allow itself to record honestly what happened.    Alternatively, the story of the drowning of Pharaoh’s army may have been inflated over time by Hebrew oral tradition, and what had been a minor skirmish in Egyptian eyes (we know, for instance, that Ramses II died not in a watery grave but in his bed) was eventually puffed up beyond all recognition.  Most radically:  the Exodus may never have taken place, but may be just a story concocted, like Gilgamesh, by nomadic herdsmen in need of an evening’s entertainment.    This last hypothesis, though temptingly unambiguous, can be maintained only by ignoring  undeniable aspects of the actual text of the Bible.    There are real differences—literary differences, differences of tone and taste, but, far more important, differences of substance and approach to material—between Gilgamesh and Exodus, and even between Gilgamesh and Genesis.""""

Cahill continues:   

""""The anonymous authors of Gilgamesh tell their story in the manner of a myth.  There is no attempt to convince us that anything in the story ever took place in historical time.   At every point, rather, we are reminded that the action is taking place “once upon a time”—in other words, in that pristine Golden Time outside of meaningless earthly time.   The story of Gilgamesh, like the gods themselves, belong to the realm of the stars.   It is meant as a model for the hearers, who believed, in any case, that everything important, everything archeteypal, happened, had happened, was happening—it is impossible to fix this occurrence clearly in one tense, since it occurs outside of time—beyond the earthly realm of unimportant instances.   For all the ancients (except the Israelites, the people who would become the Jews), time as we think of it was unreal; the Real was what was heavenly and archetypal.  For us, the heirs of the Jewish perception, the exact opposite is true:  earthly time is real time; Eternity, if we think of it at all, is the end of time (or simply an illusion).     The text of the Bible is full of clues that the authors are attempting to write history of some sort....But there is in these tales a kind of specificity—a concreteness of detail, a concern to get things right—that convinces us that the writer has no doubt that each of the main events he chronicles happened.”

Can you or another experienced editor help then. this is ridiculous all this guy is doing is assuming bad faith, nothing i say or do can change that all he wants to do is throw bad faith accusations. I would also like to see if you have a chnce where i do not have that authority from what i have read i do as long as it is used properly.HellinaBucket (talk) 

Never mind i see but this is getting out of hand. do something about it.HellinaBucket (talk) \

Does this look like a wikibreak?

HellinaBucket, leave me alone. I'm not editing the Operation Repo article (or any article) any longer, you have no reason to contact me, or ask anyone else to contact me on your behalf. The way that I met you was by catching you in the act of vandalism, and your initial response was to repeat the vandalism. It's true that you were able to get me angry enough for Orangemike to feel that I deserved a mild warning, but don't let that embolden you. The fact that you have abstained from vandalism for a few days, does not mean that you are not a vandal, and your taking offense to my using the word vandal in reference to you is unwarranted, such use does not constitute a personal attack. You are a vandal. You committed vandalism, you repeated that vandalism, and it's only been a few days since then; it doesn't wear off that quickly. I would not do this exactly the same way if I had it to do over again, but my goal was to stop you, and everyone else, from vandalizing the Operation Repo article, I feel confident that I have succeed, and I feel that the allegations of me over-stepping the guidelines in my ferocity of dealing with you are both mild and debatable. It is an added bonus, that it seems you have chosen to become a responsible editor, and I, once again, thank-you for all of the things you do which make you an effective editor. HellinaBucket, your account is only a month old, why don't you just throw it away and make a new one? There's nothing wrong with that as long as you honestly intend to be a responsible editor from here on out (If you want to be extra careful that you are following the guidelines to the letter, read WP:SOCK, but the basic idea, is that making a second account is wrong if you are doing for it the wrong reasons. If you just want to change your name, or if you are embarrassed about something you did as a beginning editor that you are not going to do again, then that's fine.). Whether or not you get a new account, there is no reason for you to contact me. I began editing Operation Repo while I was checking the recent changes for vandals. I continued to monitor it because the vandalism had been common before I was able to get the article protected. Other than that I have no interest in that subject.VegKilla (talk)  HellinaBucket (talk) 

That would be the fourth or fifth time he has accused me of creating a new ACCT. BAD FAUTH AND PERSONAL ATTACKS. THAT IS CRAPHellinaBucket (talk) 

I'm trying to enjoy my vacation, but I couldn't resist pointing out that Anden is a brand new user. The """"over the top"""" language above could be Hellina arguing with themself or it could be anyone. Personally, I do not trust anyone trying to edit this article who created their account after the article was protected. Also, the first sentence of the article has issues with tense.VegKilla (talk) 

I adamatly deny HellinaBucket's allegations of me """"still directing personal attacks."""" The only thing HellinaBucket said above that was true is that I have respect for Orangemike's opinion, and I have no respect for HellinaBucket's warnings because not only did HellinaBucket initially leave me a level 4 warning (skipping levels 1-3), but also I meet HellinaBucket by catching them in the act of vandalism (I don't think anyone would respect warnings left by a 20-day old account who is responding to being warned for vandalism, came close to violating the three-revert-rule, and is skipping the first 3 warnings).VegKilla (talk) (THIS VANDALISM WAS BRINGING THE ARTICLE WITHIN THE STANDARDS OF WIKIPEDIA BTW.HellinaBucket (talk)

He shall see his Seed - Isaiah 53: 10 
He shall sprinkle his Seed across many nations - Isaiah 52:15
Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and His Maker, ask me of things to concerning MY SONS ... Isaiah 45: 11

Look here - the admin closed as not abusive enough - what is it I did?
1.This user undid my edit, with an edit summary 'no I don't think so' which seems to breach WP:ESDONTS namely don't 'Make snide comments' or 'Be aggressive' 2.I tried to discuss at User talk:Cassianto but the user was again rather condescending and seemed to be ganging up on me with other users he already knows 3.When discussion began on at Talk:Moors murders, I simply put 'I think it is notable enough for a single line' - however, Cassianto replied 'Then you need to look up the definition of """"notable"""", clearly.' (Ignoring WP:NNC) I believe this breaches WP:CIVIL - when I indicated the editor should read WP:CIVIL they replied 'I did once, and I vowed never to read it again' 4.It is breathtaking the way some editors feel policies don't apply to them. I was not rude to the editor, but I was treated in a condescending and arrogant manner over a very minor matter

The user then preceded to launch a very abusive and malicious attack on me. He linked my 710 contributions [166] and entirely falsely wrote 'Not so ridiculous when you look at his contributions which seem to be all geared around the May elections. This user seems to be on a campaign trial on behalf of UKIP'. This is called blatantly misleading other editors, surely in violation of policies such as WP:AGF, WP:BITE, WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. I have nothing to do with UKIP. I am not a member of any political party. I am not enrolled to vote in the United Kingdom. So these are ludicrous allegations. I have created 21 pages, 16 non-related to the elections. Articles I have created such as Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 are very important and been widely edited and viewed. I have also created articles such as United Kingdom general election, 2015 (Wales) in accordance with precedent. I have worked hard on the project for good and in good faith. Examples: List of European Union member states by GDP growth and Mr Galloway Goes to Washington. I have successfully nominated dozens of articles for speedy deletion. As a new editor, I am deeply upset by how hard it is to edit this site without abuse and being treated like a moron (WP:BITE). It certainly is not encouraging for those wanting to make a difference in good faith.
Nothing at WP:SPA points to me. 5.The editor has breached multiple policies.

Editor still going. He has written now 'What makes you think I give a fuck about your political leanings?' (despite questioning them) and removed the ANI notification remarking 'what a waste of time'. What is the point of WP:CIVIL, WP:AGF, WP:NPA, WP:BITE?

What did I say that was uncivil? Mellowed Fillmore said 'It is my view that AusLondonder is clearly not here to build an encyclopedia. He is likely to remain a problematic editor and I'm not sure that any more patience needs to be shown' - yet I have created 27 pages  including Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 and List of European Union member states by GDP growth. How can they possibly say that with your agreement? 
I will address each other point at the ANI if you wish.   """,0

"NIHH Science Update • December 15, 2010

Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore led by Mikhail Pletnikov developed the mouse model used in this study by inserting a gene with a mutation known to be associated in humans with schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. They used a technique that allows them to turn the gene on and off at desired time points during brain development. In earlier research, mice with the gene, mhDISC1 (mutant human disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1) showed effects on social behavior and mood which differed depending on the sex of the mice, and the age at which the gene was active. The study shows brain development is more complex than originally thought and the argument between nature v. nature is not an easy question. The mutated gene has more control than originally thought.

Dear Non Curat Lex

According to Wikipedia """" The criterion for validity of a legal rule in such a society is that it bears the warrant of the sovereign and will be enforced by the sovereign power and its agents."""" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_positivism

You are using the term """"legal rule"""" to describe """"Laws and organizations charged with regulating judicial conduct may also impact pro se litigants. For example, The State of California Judicial Counsel has, through published materials addressed the need of the Judiciary to act in the interests of fairness to self-represented litigants. [5] The California rules express a preference for resolution of every case on the merits, even if it requires excusing inadvertance by a pro se litigant that would otherwise result in a dismissal. (While this creates double standardyour unsupported unflagged statement), The Judicial Counsel justifies it based on the idea that """"Judges are charged with ascertaining the truth, not just playing referree... A lawsuit is not a game, where the party with the cleverest lawyer prevails regardless of the merits.""""[6] It suggests """"the court should take whatever measures may be reasonable and necessary to insure a fair trial"""" and says """"There is only one reported case in the U.S. finding a judge's specific accommodations have gone too far"""".

Do you mean that """"the court should take whatever measures may be reasonable and necessary to insure a fair trial"""" """"will be enforced by the sovereign power and its agents.""""?

Why are you describing my insertion of the following 13 citations as """"controversial edits"""" and what difference does it make that it is controversial? Wikipedia is supposed to be able to deal with controversial subjects such as presidential elections.  Did you find the references to be inaccurate?  Why exactly did you delete the following?

""""The wording """" which requires a judge to “accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding . . . the right to be heard according to law.” is used in many state codes including Alabama,  Canon III a 4 http://www.alalinc.net/jic/docs/cans2006.pdf  Idaho, Canon III a 7http://www.judicialcouncil.idaho.gov/code.pdf  Indiana, Canon III b 8http://www.in.gov/judiciary/rules/jud_conduct/index.html   Kentucky,  Canon III a 7 SCR 4.300http://www.sunethics.com/kycodejudconduct.htm  New Jersey,Canon III a 6 http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/appendices/app1_jud.htm#P29_2525, NevadaCanon III b 7 http://www.leg.state.nv.us/CourtRules/SCR_CJC.html Wisconsin  SCR 60.4 g http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/rules/chap60.pdf.Pennyslvania,  Canon III a (4) http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/207/chapter33/chap33toc.html Virgina,  Canon III a 7http://www.courts.state.va.us/jirc/canons_112398.html#canon3  Rhode Island,  Canon III a 7 http://www.courts.state.ri.us/supreme/jtd/code.pdf  Washington State,Canon III a 4 http://www.cjc.state.wa.us/Gov_provision/code_canons.htm' West VirginiaCanon III a 7 http://www.state.wv.us/wvsca/JIC/Codejc.htmUtah,  Canon III b 8http://www.law.uh.edu/Libraries/ethics/Judicial/judiccanons/canon3.html 

Why did you insert the qualifier """"while this creates a double standard"""" and not flag it?  My understanding is that all a court will do is make sure the rules are understood.  As clear in the reference, if a complaint should be dismissed because of statute of limitations, for instance, there is no difference between the results based on whether it is filed by a lawyer or not.

I see no Wikipedia justification for your choice to delete the state judicial canons, even if Risker and Arthur Ruben also want them deleted.

By saying that the state judicial canons are """"controversial edits"""" you are admitting that they are """"relevant"""".

Just what are you threatening to do """"as appropriate action"""" because I flagged your unsupported statements and reinserted the 13 references to the state judicial codes?    """,0
"Sylvie, thanks for taking the time to edit my draft of Lake Roosvelt and Transboundary Law Precedents. Thanks for catching my mechanical errors! I'm currently going on three hours of sleep as a result of a term paper, haha. I agree with you about the quotations, I was hesitant to write them in at first because I wasn't even sure if quotations were allowed! But I will definitely be switching to paraphrasing, as long as the information I had down is correct and alright with you. The Lake Roosevelt piece is a bit more contemporary compared to what is going on with the rest of the article, however, the background of the 2003 lawsuit apparently goes back ~90 years according to the Colville tribe. I'll definitely look into that a bit more but for this section it wasn't my intention to go all the way up to 2008, which is the most recent year I've been able to connect with significance to the issue.

Hi - I’m User:CCFSDCA (Christopher Corbett-Fiacco) and I understand the concerns expressed by many of you regarding the articles I’ve posted at Wikipedia the past week or so. I am in fact the author of The Whole World Calendar Book of Holidays Around the World, as stated (an as-yet unpublished book which is based upon the self-published The Whole World Calendar 2008 [and 2009; email me at wholeworldcalendar@gmail.com and I’ll be glad to send you a sample page and info on ordering, if interested]). I have sent Wikipedia its permissions grant for using copyrighted material as requested and assure you that I am not self-promoting. My mistake is in not yet spending the time to figure out exactly how to cite the book as the reference for the article, which I’ll do as soon as I have the time. My intent in adding the articles is that they are actual national/religious/cultural holidays and festivals, are therefore ‘newsworthy’ if not particularly important, and, having spent two years researching the topic, I can assure you that it is quite difficult at times to find such information  try to find out what Earthquake Victims Memorial Day is in Armenia and you’ll see what I mean. It is my intent to self-publish the book within 6 months if I cannot find a publisher. Meanwhile, feel free to delete my articles as desired. I’ll revisit the subject at a later date and repost them only after I’ve ascertained that I am, in fact, doing it right.

No, YOU and DIANA and a handfull of other people accuse Steiner of racism, that's all. That's why it is a only a tiny minority viewpoint, and that's why it should not be represented. I'm not saying represented at all, I'm saying represented as a subarticle. It gives that article undue weight. 

And the reason that it DOES matter as to the point I made about other encyclopedias not accusing or even mentioning Steiner's racial views is that these encyclopedias are the mainstream academic viewpoints.

Well, Alan, the article may be more about a type of smoking than a type of smoking reduction but the benefit of one-hitters to the latter issue remains important.
You have reduced the number of pictures to 3 this seems to me unbalanced in that Smoking pipe (tobacco) is allowed to run on for over 23,000 bytes (all drawn from only 3 notes, 3 references, 5 external links) with 11 pictures compared to One-hitter (smoking) with under 4000 bytes and 3 pictures.  Factbase: I should google this first, but I think I saw an article stating that only 1% of the tobacco smokers worldwide use a pipe (compared with 5% cigar and 94% cigarettes); if 1/10 as many persons used cannabis as tobacco and 10% of cannabis users used a one-hitter, on that basis alone besides there being ethnic one-hitters used for tobacco too the articles should have equal length.
I think the value of the article depends partly on some information (particularly history) which is conveniently presented in picture captions; so how about I look into using the """"gallery"""" approach which posts the pictures at the bottom of the article, smaller than the regular thumbnail kind but enlargeable.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back.

"""

I smell trouble brewing.  Let's figure this out before an edit war starts.  I see a few issues here in dispute: 
1) Cold-blooded=stockier draft type vs. cold-blooded=origin in cold climates.  I had learned it as the draft-type definition, but I have seen both definitions in use.  I don't necessarily think they are mutually exclusive.  While I think that the geographical terminology likely defined the core original breeds, with years of interbreeding this becomes messy.  So many breeds have differing degrees of both types.  For example, Warmbloods are not the only mixtures of European and Arabian blood.  Wouldn't this strict definition mean that Quarter Horses would be a type of warmblood? My feeling is that we can say something like: """"The hot-blooded/cold-blooded terminology originally related to the geographical origin of the breed, but now has come to refer to the overall character of the horse or pony.""""

2) Ponies (most if not all) are cold-blooded because they originated in cold climates vs. some ponies are cold-blooded because they are draft-type.  Again, I think we can finesse this without saying that one is right or wrong.  I personally think that most ponies are draft-type, and so could be considered cold-blooded, with certain hot-blooded exceptions like the [Hackney pony].  Although, really, come to think of it, lots of ponies are more like little warmbloods...

3) Ponies were not used for 'draft' work in general because they were too small.  As I understand it, some pony breeds flourished at times because they were useful as draft horses in the mines.  For example: """"when the coal mining industry became extensively developed in Britain in the 1800’s, Shetlands were imported in great numbers to haul coal cars in the 'pits'."""" (From """"Shetland Pony"""")

Just my two cents...  """,0
"""

Strong oppose .  The Serer Niominka are part of the Serer ethnic group.  Failure to recognise that would be a failure to recognise the diversity of the Serer group.  Even Becker commented on this diversity (See: Charles Becker. """"Vestiges historiques, trémoins matériels du passé clans les pays sereer"""". Dakar. 1993).  Not only are they group together with the Serers because they speak Serer, but they also have Serer culture etc. Every one even in the Senegambia refer to them as Serers and they see themselves as Serers.  Is just like saying the Ndut and Safi etc who speak Cangin languages are not Serers ethnically.  Sometimes people use Niominka as a shorthand, but I don't think we should deny people their Serer heritage.  Indeed, by referring to them as Serer-Niominkaa, we recognise both their Serer heritage and Niominka.  To call them just Niominka would be denying them their Serer heritage.  Many scholar refer to them as Serer-Niominka just as Serer-Njegeme, Serer-Siin, etc.  (See:   Dennis Charles Galvan. The state must be our master of fire, p38. Also: Leonardo Alfonso Villalón. Islamic society and state power in Senegal, p51; African economic history, volume 25, University of WisconsinMadison. African Studies Program, p32).  Most of the confusion regarding who should be called Serer is to do with the various cangin languages and Serer Sine.  The Serer people however are not confused and they see themselves as Serer ethnically even if they speak a different dialect or language to other Serers.  It is normally outsiders who tend to divide the Serer into compartments rather than just letting them be.  The Serer Associations of Dakar as well as the Serer community have been trying for years to fight this division of the Serer group by outsiders.  No one is subsuming anyone.  Serer-Niominka culture is recognised and celebrated within the Serer group just like Serer-Sine, Serer-Njegheme etc.  The reason for this is, because it is Serer culture period.

"Andy, thank you very much! )  What are the locations of those lost buildings?  All in Aachen?  I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?",0

Neither of you addressed my point about self description or the official description of the school and the state. What about the stance of the more than 500k alumni?

Additionally I present other arguments. *Chicago El is called so by the local population. However outside of Chicago, most people would call the system a """"rapid transit system"""" and later in the article it is in fact described as such. In the opening paragraph clear preference is given to the local name even though consensus among the wider world community is that it is a rapid transit system. *What about Chief Osceola from FSU? In that article he is described as a symbol, there is zero mention of mascot. I would argue that the performance of Chief Osceola is identical in spirit to the performance of Chief Illiniwek. Both are meant to pay reverence to American Indian Culture. In fact Chief Illiniwek existed for 36 years prior to Chief Osceola. """,0

"Energy certificates  It is assumed there is some reason why users continually refer to energy credit while it has been pointed out that this is a misnomer in regard to Technocracy ideas. 
Energy Accounting is a hypothetical system of distribution, which would record the Energy used to produce and distribute goods and services consumed by citizens in a Technate. The units of this accounting system would be known as Energy CertificatesThese would replace money in a Technate, but unlike traditional money or currencies, energy certificates could not be saved or earned, only distributed evenly among a populace. The amount of certificates given to each citizen would be calculated by determining the total productive capacity of the technate and dividing it equally. The Energy Certificates themselves would probably not have to be physically used by the populace, as the system would be computerised. In energy accounting the Technate would use information of Natural resources, industrial capacity and citizen’s purchasing habits to determine how much of any good or service was being consumed by the populace, so that it could match production with consumption.

The reason for the use of Energy Accounting serves to ensure the highest possible standard of living as well as equality among the Technate’s citizenry, as well as prohibit spending that is beyond the productive capacity of the technocracy.Energy Accounting An article on Energy Accounting as proposed by Technocracy Inc. Technocrats point out that energy accounting is not rationing; it is a way to distribute an abundance and track demand. Everyone would receive an equal, abundant (i.e. far more than they need), amount of energy certificates.

When he later saw more of what the party was about however, he suggested its members were disfavoring Germans in an attempt to save the multiethnic melting pot of Austria-Hungary.

((In addition, if I wish for other users to NOT communicate with me, I also have THAT right, it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so.  Although I personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex-spouses from communicating with each other when necessary, the part of the law that refers to STRANGERS such as on Wikipedia or anywhere on the Internet, it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc.  That is why every message board in existence has an option to """"disable the private messaging system"""".))

"Morgause's Parents 

It was recently learned that she has a half sister, Morgause, who was smuggled out of Camelot by Gaius at her birth, and it was revealed by Gaius that she is the daughter of Gorlois. The identity of her mother remains unknown.

We can't know Gorlois is Morgause's father for sure, just from the crest she wore and in fact it seems like its the other way around, from recent events. Helen (I believe is her name?), Gorlois' wife, seems to be the shared parent of Morgana and Morgause.

Spoilers for 3x05, if you haven't seen:

If Morgana and Morgause share a father, why did Morgana continue to call Morgause 'sister' after revealing to Morgause that Uther was her father? They would be entirely unrelated if Gorlois was not Morgana's father. And you would think the subject would have come up.

Also, the way Morgause mentioned that the healing bracelet she gave Morgana was 'a gift from her mother' seems to imply more that they share a mother and not a father.",0

After Davis sent Aquino his acceptance on March 17, 1973, he was presented with the honorary membership on April 13, 1973 by Aquino and Karla LaVey alone. ASL did not meet Davis until August 1973. Davis would later renounce Satanism, claiming later he was """"only into it for the chicks"""" and re-embraced Judaism. At a nationaly televised event honoring him a few weeks before he died, Davis said """"First of all, I want to thank Jesus for letting me be here tonight"""", completely shattering any doubt he had any lingering affinty to Satanism.

A merger is probably a good idea.  First, the prehistoric man article is terrible.  In fact it shouldn't exist as anything other than a stub.  The term """"Prehistoric man"""" is no longer used by scholars and hasn't been since the 1970's becuase it is androcentric and because there really is no such thing as a group or type of people who are characteristically """"prehistoric"""".  In other words, people in prehistoric societies have no particualar commonalities except a lack of writing.  Prehistory is a rubric used by scholars to differentiate the methods used to study the past, not a type of people.  There is no such thing as a stage of personhood or social development in which a person is a prehistoric man or woman.  For example, the Inca remained a prehistoric people until the Spanish conquest and yet they ruled one of the most impressive empires on earth and still had no writen records (quipa were memory aids, not writing).  In Central America, the prehistoric period starts more than a thousand years earlier.  Further, the term is Eurocentric and based on the notion of progressive stages of """"mankind"""" like the """"stone age"""".  There are people who still use stone tools.  The """"ages as stages"""" concepts have long since been abandoned in the social sciences since they do not apply universally and can not be tied directly to other political and social developments around the world.

And as I pointed out, physicists and cosmologists do investigate what might have happened before the big bang.  It's not a scientifically meaningless question as this section is trying to claim.  And Kaku's description of the molecules in the jar not being moved, as I pointed out, is not motion from nothing.  The molecules had to have a probability or potential to move.  The reason things can move without another body moving them is they had a probability to move based on the uncertainty principle.  When you ask physicists why a particle just started moving or why for instance the particles are generated in a vacuum, they would say because of the uncertainty principle and the laws of quantum physics.  That's implying a cause.  There was a cause for the motion or the creation, not something out of nothing.  Now laws of physics and probabilities are not nothing.  And where did they come from?  Hawking I believe in a actual paper he wrote had the universe jumpstarted from a primeordial wave function, see Hartle-Hawking state, but where did that come from?  And this idea, as most ideas about the initial conditions of the universe, has been in no way accepted by all or even most scientists.  So unless it can be shown from a credible cited source that the vast majority of physicists and cosmologists hold that the cosmological argument has actually been scientifically refuted, not that they just don't personally accept it or something like that, we should not be making that claim.  For instance the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy makes no such claim, and has several pros and cons for the argument based on modern science, including the example of vacuum motion and vacuum genesis.  And as for popular science sources, Carl Sagan always held that the idea of a creator and generator of the universe had neither been proven nor disproven by science.",0

"I am confused as to how I could have been bloked for Vandalisim. I have never vandilized anyones work. I hae edited pages because the original authors have put in factual errors or I have added things and sourced them. I edited the PIRA article, because Jdorney continues to revert it back to the un-factual article he orginally wrote. If Wikipedia is about accuracy, then I am confused as to why I would be banned from editing a un-factual article...particularly when I make sure to source my additions or changes. Everyone does this on Wikipedia, if I am going to be blocked for this...Jdorney should to, sine he does the same thing...or do editors get special treatment.

Another ridiculous complaint was made by SWATJester about the SAD article. The original SAD article was missing some facts, so I put facts from sources like Time Magazine, LA Times, Newsweek, and the New Yorker
in. But I did not delete any of his work, I merely added to it...so I don't know whyu the guy is throwing such a little hissy fit.

"""==Translation issues==
In the original German was a sentence, """"Vor dem Dalang liegt auch kein Bananenstrunk, der die Puppen aufnimmt, sondern ein Plangkan (eine Art Tisch mit Löchern in der Tischplatte), auf dem die benötigten Puppen bereit gestellt werden.""""

I am changing this to simply , """"In front of the Dalang is a Plangkan (a type of table with holes punched in its surface), on which the necessary puppets sit ready for use. 

I think (but am not certain) that the that the untranslated part is more or less a joke: roughly, that there what is on the table is not a foo foo drink for the puppets. If anyone with better German than me thinks I'm wrong and there is something more substantial here, please restore the appropriate phrase. Thanks.

 

Another sentence with which I had trouble: Die Figuren dieser Schattenspiele waren Wayang Golek (normale Kopfgestalt durch einen da-mit verbundenen Stab auf dem Rumpf drehbar. Arme durch je ein Stab, der an der Hand befestigt ist beweglich) , geschnitzte, bemalte und bekleidete Figuren, die an Fäden gezogen wurden, Malereien auf Schautafeln oder geweihte und verkleidete Menschen.

I've rendered this """"The figures in these puppet plays were wayang golek (normally a head assembly connected by a straight stick to a trunk, allowing the head to swivel. Arms were attached to a separate staff, allowing hand motions), carved, painted and dressed figures, manipulated via threads or strings, painted dioramas or sanctified and dressed humans,"""" but that may not be quite right. If you know better, please correct the article (and make a note here that you've done so).   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Your translation seems OK. Geweihte could also mean """"horned"""", which would make sense in the case of demons. """"Sanctified"""", as in """"blessed"""", makes less sense in the context.  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Another tricky one: Wayang-Klitik-Figuren meist erheblich beschädigt, sehr zum Gaudium der Zuschauer..."""" I haven't even ventured a translation for this, it has several words I don't properly know. Is Gaudium perhaps the Latin word, as in """"gaudeamus igitur""""?   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

Another problematic sentence: Aus diesem Grunde haben Wayang-Klitik-Figuren, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden und dort Kampfszenen zu durchstehen haben, Arme aus Leder. I currently have this partially translated as """"On this basis the wayang klitik figures have, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden and where battle scenes zu durchstehen haben, leather arms."""" I know that durchstehen is to stand one's ground, but I still can't fully translate the sentence.   18:17, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

And another: Aus Jenggala und Kediri stammen die Geschichten von Raden Panji und Cindelaras, die ein paar Dorfjungen mit ihren Kampfhähnen erleben. The first part is """"From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelara,"""" I'm not at all clear on the latter part. My dictionary says Kampfhähnen are literally fighting cocks, but can just be pugnacious people.   19:46, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
 Someone else has now simply rendered this as fighting cocks, but I'd consider that suspect (since one can't tell from the original German). I'd like to find a more primary source before considering this necessarily correct.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)
 I translated it as I did, because it explicitly says """"the boys with their X"""", and not somthing like """"the two x-like boys"""".  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

An interesting link: Wooden puppet is performed almost the same way as the wayang kulit, but there is no screen in front of the puppeteer, and no banana trunk to stuck the wayang. In stead a 'Plangkan' (permanent wooden table with holes) to support the wooden puppets is used.''
 12:52, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

The Standard Note you quote is just Adam Mellows-Facer's opinion. I think I sent in several corrections to Standard Notes and Research Papers over the years then I just got bored with it.

True to say that but totally irrelevant: most voters in 1935 understood National Labour to be in effect Conservative, and it was only the Macdonald family which thought of it as being Labour. What the SN says when giving examples is no more definitive than a newspaper article and I absolutely refute that it is 'authoritative'.

The reason why swing is used for Conservative and Labour only and not for any other parties is that it doesn't work properly for others.

I'm currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario... and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to.

I don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a PNRS is caused by some intelligence, another PNRS is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third PNRS is probably caused by some intelligence. There are unknown possible ways to generate a PNRS, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. This feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 10 years ago. Back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. Florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. Politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. So, they pressure the upper management of NASA to launch outside the designed safe range. This happened a number of time without problem. At some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. This continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. If you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. It could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the PNRS was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third PNRS. This is playing on a """"gut feeling"""" that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 20 rolls. Some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of """"pattern"""" and bet based off of that, on the """"gut feeling"""" that the roullette wheel has some bias.

Whilst the article does mention these things in one form or another, it really does need to be succinctly in this location as well.

It is a defect of this article that it talks too much about “cures” which indeed gives a biased view. The controversy section is best kept short, as there is a main article. 
I agree, the Controversy section is best kept short, not incorrectly biased and lacking information, as it currently stands.  
The controversy is that some people think that it is immoral to use cells from embryos that will be put in the trashcan otherwise. That is all there is to it. 
Your anaolgy is about as crass as saying """"oh look, theres a dead body there, lets use it for fertilizer, after all, its dead"""".

Your opinion whilst well informed isn't any more right then someone else who adheres to a different belief system. And thank you for clarrifying that it is indeed a contraversial issue.

No, because those embryos really do end in trash cans, whatever the whish of the family be. This is the general rule, whereas found bodies end up in the morgue, then are incinerated if not claimed. And the ashes are indeed used as fertiliser in this case. It might seem crass to say so, but it is still the truth.

January 2008 - Publication of the Neural Colony-Forming Cell (NCFC) Assay as a simple assay to enumerate neural stem cells. Importantly, the assay allows discrimination between neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells.

I dont consider the March 2008 key event to be so notable given that it was only shown in one individual and has not been replicated since.  (# March 2008-The first published study of successful cartilage regeneration in the human knee using autologous adult mesenchymal stem cells is published by Clinicians from Regenerative Sciences[52])    

Added EL
I've added an EL, """"Ethics of Stem Cell Research"""". As it's from the well-known Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, there shouldn't be any problems with this addition.  

HI, this is WRONG!

MarnetteD clearly has a watch list longer than my arm given his response time to reverting things, so he'll see what's been done and will just have to deal with it. While categories may require reliable sourcing, to a degree, the fact remains than for so many actors dating back to the 50s, 60s, 70s, especially, there is unlikely to be centralised sourcing, though many books are in print, such as actor biogs, few editors are really going to dig them all out and cite hundreds of actors entire career for each TV and film appearance, it would take months, even years, of effort. Wikipedia:Citing IMDb notes that IMDB has been a constant source of dispute over its reliability. However, for a category to simply state """"this person was a Western (genre) TV actor"""" hardly requires AAA-rated reliable sourcing, and I do believe than IMDB meets the requirements as a tertiary source, confirming the fact that all those actors were active in that genre. Many of the individual articles for each Western TV series don't contain any more sourcing than IMDB, so it is not wrong to identify MarnetteD's reverts as """"missing the point"""" when it comes to avoiding WP:POINTed behaviour. A tertiary source is better than no source at all, and categories are hardly top-level articles worth war-editing over. I find his behaviour protracted, bullyish and contrived as well as completely lacking WP:AGF standards. He needs to holster his attitude, because I'm not afraid to present his behaviour, including repeated history of the same behaviour, to ANI/EW and request that action be taken for his abuse of policy and anti-IP sniping motions. The lack of maturity exhibited in reverting those articles without consensus, openly taking advantage of my 48 hour block, will not be seen in good taste as it was clearly an opportunistic move, but a very stupid one which I don't take lightly. WP:BURO and WP:IAR applies here. We don't need strict reliable sourcing for a category as all those actors have an IMDB page, the majority of those IMDB pages are accurate, and if the category aims to improve wiki by indexing all the actors of that genre, it is for the better. To filter out those which lack a reliable source lacks NPOV because there are dozens of categories which make statements about things and people which don't have strong sourcing. But in this case, knowing an actor was a Western TV actor is hardly controversial. If MarnetteD reverts a single page he should be prepared to back it up with something other than WP:DEFINING, which is a guideline, not policy, but so far as """"if the characteristic would not be appropriate to mention in the lead portion of an article, it is probably not defining"""" goes, there are considerably more articles that don't follow that ideal to the letter than do, which makes it a weak guideline to attempt to enforce unless an editor has a strong motive to do so. If he enjoys attention and drama, I expect to see him an ANI/EW before the week's out. 82.8.252.13  """,0

Ideas for improving the article
Great article. I took the liberty of replacing ˡ (U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L) in the article with ˈ (U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE) where it is used to indicate a stressed syllable. The former character is incorrect since although it appears as a vertical line in sans-serif fonts, it actually appears like a superscript lowercase l or a superscript 1 in serif fonts like Charis SIL and Doulos SIL. I only noticed this because I have a CSS hack that applies to all uses of the IPA template and forces a different font for them. I’m taking phonology at U. Hawaii at Mānoa so I’ll be sure to add anything interesting about Hawaiian that comes up. —  

Oh crap! Didn't even catch that.  I hope I haven't done it elsewhere.  

Well, like I said, I only noticed it because I have a CSS hack in place. I only wish that the rest of the world had the SIL IPA fonts installed... —  

Again, glad you like the article. The replacement symbol you used looked alright to me, but so did the original symbol. It's a stretch to claim """"[t]he former character is incorrect"""" on the basis of its appearance in fonts that 99.99% of users do not have. Most people have never heard of the Summer Institute for Linguistics. The character that I used to mark syllable stress is the one that Wikipedia presents for use in the IPA list of symbols below the edit box. So if you feel you have a """"better"""" symbol, then you should contact Wikipedians who are in a position to consider implementing your suggestion(s). You might try Brion Vibber. If you learn something new about Hawaiian phonology at UH, do let us know. But remember, Wikipedia does not want anything that is not already published. So if it's """"new"""", it might be unpublished, and therefore undesirable under Wikipedia policy.   

The font used to display the characters is unimportant. Their character encodings are specific. On the basis of the two Unicode names, I argue that U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L is inappropriate as the stress marker in IPA. Checking the appropriate Unicode chart on their website I find that U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE is listed under the section “Miscellaneous phonetic modifiers” with the comment “primary stress, downstep; precedes letter or syllable modified”. On the other hand, U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L is given in the section “Additions based on 1989 IPA” just below U+02E0 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL GAMMA which has the comment “these modifier letters are occasionally used in transcription of affricates”. So it’s fairly clear that the Unicode standard makes a distinction between their intended purposes. I note that in the bottom of the edit box the two are given in sequence, with U+02C8 immediately following U+02E1. It’s easily possible to press the first of the two accidentally. I will bring this up at m:Help talk:Special characters and ask someone to reorder them for clarity. —  

Your explanation and argument sounds good. I don't know the layout of the """"insert box"""" characters on other users' screens. When I edit, the IPA characters are displayed in two lines. The first line ends with tiny lowercase superscripts: h, w, a j-like character, gamma, """"lefty"""" glottal, n. The second line begins with the character I used for stress mark, followed by other stress marks, length mark, something too obscure to make out, a mid-height black square (apparently used to mark the end of a series of related symbols), and then the line ends with the double-curly-bracketed IPA. Based on your explanation, it appears that the first line of IPA characters is broken in a way that misled me into thinking that the last member of the series of superscripts is the first member of a series of stress marks. Bad line break. And there is no mid-height black square, nor significant white space, separating the superscript series from the stress mark series. Not seeing that previously, I used the first mark because it looks the same as the second, but darker. Of course, it also happened because a tiny superscripted sans-serif L looks nearly identical to a tiny superscripted vertical line.

If you have the motivation, maybe you can suggest more than just reordering in your communication with the Special Characters people. The addition of a separation character between the series of superscripts and the series of stress marks will help. Here's my best suggestion to offer on this matter - persuade the Special Characters folks to implement appropriate new text for the ho",0

My Reply
Rjecina, calm down. Please, read my postings carefully, I have never said that Vlahs did not exist. Your comments are ludacris and off topic.  

Zenanarh, thanks for the reply. I have read the link that you have posted about the term vlah. The website is called """"G-d, Bosnia and Bosniaks"""", so i took all of the information describing Serbs with a grain of salt. I did enjoy reading the article, it  definietly had a lot of information that could be incorporated into the article (if there is another source backing it up). I have two major concerns. Firstly, the article concentrates on the Bosnian side Vlah's and not the Croatian side (the article is Serbs of Croatia not Serbs of Bosnia). Secondly, the article concludes with """"...when one hears... Russian politicians talking about the need to defend their ancient Slav brothers in Bosnia, that the one component of the Bosnian population which has a large and identifiable element of non-Slav ancestry is the Bosnian Serbs."""" I do not know how accurate the article is because of the last statement (in my opinion it leans towards the Muslim side). Also, inside the article there is a mention that Serbian scholars identify the term Vlah with shepards. Irrespectively, I think the article link was a great contribution.

After reading the article, the Bosnian Vlah's were """"settled"""" by Ottomans. Conversely, Croatian side Vlah's """"escaped"""" Ottoman prosecution. This was a mistake in """"Serbs of Croatia"""" article, which stated that Vlah's were settled by the Ottomans in Croatia.""",0

 Apotropaic exposure of female genitalia 

The La Fontaine reference seems to be wrong in several of the quoted authorities, who state it is from La Fontaine's Fables, but the illustration they refer to is from La Fontaine's Nouvelles Contes. The story in question is Le Diable de Papefiguière. The illustration by Charles Eisen was copied to decorate a late 18th century porcelain cup and saucer, which I found illustrated at  (Accessed ) where it is described as follows:

Paris cup and saucer with scenes from La Fontaine's Contes 1785-90Dark blue ground, rich gilding of scrolls, foliage trails and vases. Reserves on the cup and saucer with grisaille scenes, identified in gilt writing on the underside: on the cup """"la jument du compere pierre"""", and on the saucer """"le diable de papefiguiere"""". No marks. Height of cup 6.1 cm, diameter of saucer 12.9 cm. Circa 1785-90.

This cup is of the Sèvres """"gobelet litron"""" shape. Although unmarked, the quality of the gilding indicates one of the top Paris factories at the period, such as the Duc d'Angoulême's (Dihl & Guérhard). The two painted scenes are taken from the 1767 edition of the Contes de La Fontaine, which was pirated from the famous 1762 Fermiers Généraux one, with engravings after drawings by Charles Eisen. Le Diable de Papefiguière is the story of a devil which comes to frighten a village…

The commentators state that the woman exposes herself to fighten the demon, but I think the story is less straightforward. I haven't found an English translation yet, but it seems to me to be a variation of a well-known folk theme in which Satan/devil/demons are tricked by a cunning peasant couple. An English example would be the folk song """"The Devil and the Feathery Wife"""".  | Talk """,0

A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

""":I don't mean books by the way (which contain hundreds of pages) but any concise bio.  
I looked through several bios on bookrag and none, some of which were pretty lengthy, mentioned Falk. It's off topic and additionally, he doesn't even have an article.  

Well, I'm not sure that Falk needs to be included in the Jordan article or not (though he did seem to have a huge influence on Jordan's career), but in any case, I have written a Wikipedia article for David Falk.  I would appreciate it if others would read it over to see if the article is any good, and secondly to decide if he should be mentioned in the Jordan article (as I look at the Jordan article again, it even says in the second sentence that """"he became one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation""""... since it was Falk who did the marketing, he probably deserves a link there).  My information for the Falk article came partly from David Halberstan's book Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made, which has about 10 pages on Falk, as well as a ton of online articles I found.  Cheers!   

I added a few brief lines about Falk in the section """"Media figure and business interests.""""  Falk is probably too off-topic to put him in the opening section, but I think he's important enough to mention in a section specifically about Jordan's role as a media figure, since Falk was largely responsible for crafting Jordan's image.  

 Divorce 

Is is just me or does it seem like, unlike an earlier divorce threat five years ago, Michael & Juanita's split seemed to have been kept quiet by most of the media?

I'm wondering because the first I've heard of the current proceedings was last night when I heard something about this being the most expensive celebrity divorce ever?   
Five years ago, he was still in the NBA, so obviously he has a bigger spot light on him. For the most part, Jordan isn't under the lime light anymore, so it doesn't have much coverage.  
It was announced in the press when it happened. But it was one of those things where people stopped talking about it a couple of days later.

Nick Names
I don't believe the Nickname """"Superman"""" is valid in the case of MJ. Yes, he was called Superman, Pippen was called Batman, and Rodman, Rod-man for a brief time. But Superman as a nickname has been used for almost every prominent player in the NBA; i.e. Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and especially Shaq. Nicknames should be identifiable to unique players. If you ask someone who knows nothing about Basketball, what were Jordan's nicknames, they would say Air, or Air Jordan, and throw in the acronym's, M.J. Jordan has had plenty of nicknames, but we don't list every single Nickname, only the most identifiable. That's why his NBA.com Historical Bio, only lists Air Jordan as his nickname. I propose mutual consensus on the issue, before more users begin to add obsessive Wp:fancruft to the article. Feel free to comment.  
Agree, Superman is not a common nickname for him. At all. It gets used all the time for athletes. Unless he gets a Superman tattoo on his arm like Shaq and starts calling himself Superman it's not worth inclusion.

Joseph Stalin
My text wasn't edited, it was reversed.  I was trying to improve the article by removing POV and making neater summaries.  
Look further back at my edit history and you'll see my edits were heavy rewrites to flimsy sections, not reverts done to annoy people.  Also, nobody else has really done anything substantial for this article for quite some time.  In the months I've been working on it, other writers have only been adding snippets or links.  
So... if I added extensive justifications to my edits, they might pass?  People complain that this article is biased, and I'm trying to FIX that.  Also, I replaced the lead image of Stalin with a photograph, but Tocino thinks the previous painting is better.  A painting, especially a flattering one made for propaganda, is inferior to an actual photograph, especially on as sharp as the one I've put in (you can even see his pockmarks).  

Hello
I have made sure that I have not violated the 3RR rule because I have been suspended for this in the past. I have waited patiently for a day to pass before I could add the better, more famous image of Stalin (which was on the article before Kurzon came along). Unfortunately, Kurzon has taken a different tactic and in the past couple of hours he has reverted three times without an edit summary to two different editors.

 Query about an """"official page"""" 

Hi Mikaey, 
Yesterday I attempted to post a page on here on behalf of an organisation for which I am currently working as an intern (FDC). Only problem was that we have a specific and official way of saying things which happens to be that of the website and several primary, so I just referenced there. In your review you stated """"We cannot accept copyrighted content taken from web sites or printed sources."""" There are several similar non-profit organisations which have pages on Wikipedia with their official statements published too, I was just wondering if copyright still applies when you are the authorised party? Is there any way I can have this article published without changing the words away from our official statement? Also if I just change the words briefly so it is different from the website but still conveys the message of our organisational profile can it then be published? 
Any help would be much appreciated as I am pretty stuck with where to go on this.
Thank you so much in advance
  

The user here is talking about this page from the AfC queue.  I declined it because at least one section (About the FDC) seemed to be a word-for-word copy from their website.  Notwithstanding any other issues with this article, would someone like to weigh in on the issue of the text's copyright status?  If the organization agrees to let the text be published under the GFDL, would he be good?  Thanks,   
If the organization releases the text as GFDL through an OTRS email, there should be no problem with the """"copyrights""""; but the article as a whole has too much WP:COI and how they wrote their phone numbers and email addresses looks spamy. The article dosen't say anything about notability of the company either. Oh you were asking only about copyrights..sorry. An OTRS email would be sufficient.

No, the phrasing is wrong. """"Lying"""" is the present participle of """"to lie"""" - it's one of the painful ones consistently gotten wrong in English ) If she was currently continuing to lie to a jury then it can be used.

Nicely said! XD  I'd also like to add that it's official that Shadow does care about Rouge, but we don't know why, or to what extent.  While myself and others like to speculate in other places, all that should be mentioned here is the citable facts for both situations and letting the reader decide.  Also, this does not involve dropping biased little hints in the relay. (What the HELL is up with Rouge's bit on Knuckles's page?  But anywho, there needn't be a """"relationship"""" section for anyone other that Amy.  If you must document something it should be dealings with other characters that heavily affect the one being discussed.  

Examples:
On Amy's page, her obsession and dealings with Sonic should be mentioned, as it's a focal point of her character.

On Sonic's page, Tails should be mentioned as the two are a speedy Dynamic duo.  Vice versa for Tails's page.

Also, like it or not, Shadow's dealings with Rouge do factor into his character.  Simply put, she brings out the best in him.

Silver's page should include his dealings with Blaze as he's been shown to be quite emotional concerning her.

Now these little odd things, like how Knuckles deals with Shadow or whatever, that's not important.  Nothing of significance happens.  Use your heads folks XD. """,0

 Ambiguity 

Hey Murry,

Firstly, """"unambiguous"""" was what I was going for in my edit summary - not """"inambiguous""""! Probably a typo!

Anyway, thank you for your second edit summary, in which you corrected from 'vandalism' to 'good faith': much appreciated. )

On to the matter itself: Ireland is an island. It is also a name by which the governing authority refers to itself as. However, this causes a conflict. As a person who apparently holds logic in high esteem, I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. It is not clear, to many people throughout the world, what is meant by """"Ireland"""". Unless you are from there (and even then, there can often be confusion), usually the context is not''''' understood. I think in this case, whereby the subject of education is a governmental and state-specific, and whereby the system does not concern a wider jurisdiction of the whole of the island of Ireland, the more unambiguous title should be given to the country.

Otherwise, people (mostly people not from that region of the world) will make an incorrect assumption. A link to the more relevant article is not enough: I doubt most people would hover their mouse over the link or click on it to find out what """"Ireland"""" is. After all, most people (think they) know, right? 173.93.239.247

My Offer Anent My Unblock
I am back to pursue my case, not in the form of """"trolling and harassment"""", but in a polite, urbane manner. I ask that you bear with me on this.

History
From alpha to omega, here is an aperçu.
My work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using 207.97.213.170. My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then. 

I returned with Hiineedrequestforcomment to """"pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for """"trolling and harassment"""". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.

I returned with The Reformed Editor, truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, """"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?"""" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.

Declarations
I pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me.
I promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall.
I promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made:
Bode Miller
Julia Mancuso
Shaun White
Ted Ligety
Purna
Akola city
2010 Winter Olympics
And many more. . .
I issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.

Final Thoughts
The year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier.
To Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you """"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock"""". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked?
I will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum.
I hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it.
I hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles stark",0

The article should be unprotected and reference to Serbia should be included. I dont think Albanian wikipedians should try to stop this from happening. The problem (and paradox) of Kosovo still being part of Serbia is not going to go away by negating it on wikipedia.

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Charles Darwin establishing evolution? 

Charles Darwin theorized or came up with the theory of evolution. Changing it back to """"established"""" is both biased and untrue. The reason I change it back is because it is incorrect. Only pure ignorance compels people to say that he """"established"""" anything. The definition of """"established"""" is an accomplished fact. You cannot say that the theory of evolution is a fact, because, after all, it is still a theory.

"Technically you still can't distinguish acceleration from gravity - they are, in fact, one in the same. The simple direction difference between the negative and positive masses accelerations are not qualifiers for discrimination. There is no way, in a single reference frame, to distinguish the negative and positive masses - i.e. whether the earth is negative or positive mass and the object in question  is positive or negative. Further, the magnitude of the acceleration should be identical for each object.

I would suggest reading up on Hawking's idea (in his universe in a nutshell book) that mass energy + gravitational energy = 0. In essence, you can create all the matter you want, as long as it has gravitational pull which he regards as a negative energy. If this is the case, then there could, in fact, be negative mass with positive gravitational energy, which behaves in an opposite manner. I would presume that annihilation due to matter-antimatter interactions would have gravitational energy considerations as well - but in any case, the mere fact that negative mass would accelerate in a different direction in a gravitational field does not in itself preclude its existence, especially since gravitational laws were formulated without accounting for this eventuality.",0

 Boolean algebras 

I was pleasantly surprised to see you on the list at BATF. I didn't realize discussion was ongoing on one of the Boolean algebras pages; see Talk:Boolean logic for that, and for some background about the established participants. In the end, it will require everyone who already has been involved with the Boolean algebra articles to compromise to find a solution, and having some mediating voices will help. I started an outline on WT:BATF that I hope will draw comments and get the ball rolling. — Carl ( · talk) 

It is good that you are doing this. I hope I will have time to make some helpful comments. I signed up because I got interested in the whole Boolean algebra issue last summer, so if you want to get some idea of my perspective, see Talk:Boolean algebra (structure)/Archive 3. Anyway, as a result, I know some of the participants and opinions involved, and realised that more mediating voices might be valuable! Geometry guy 

 AFD/SEW discussion 

Hi GG,

Regards this comment, I'm not trying to be duplicitous and don't see it as quote mining.  Reading the whole of Wikipedia:Simple English Wikipedia, I still see it as a grey area on whether SEW is exclusively about language.  The use of 'for example', suggests that the list of possible users is not a comprehensive one.  If Simple wiki is meant to be exclusively linguistically simple but cover the same content to the same depth, then a clarification on that page would be valuable.  It's just my opinion based on my reading of the page.  If I am reading it incorrectly, either I'm stupid, which I doubt  ), or there's wiggle room.  The statements """"Its articles are intended to be less complex..."""" and """"In general, Simple English articles are simplifications of the most important points in existing articles...: suggest that SEW is not mere linguistic simplification, it's conceptual as well.  If the purpose of SEW has always been merely linguistic simplification, then the page could be clearer on this point.  If you are certain about the SEW existing exclusively for linguistic variation, I have no problem with editing the page to reflect this, and it should in fact be done if the consensus is Simple is linguistic only (I've left a comment regards this here).  I've never edited SEW or looked at the website itself, so if you've expertise in this area, I'm happy to bow to it.    

 I did not mean to suggest your were being duplicitous: apologies. However, rather than asking me or enwiki what SEW is all about, I suggest checking out SEW itself: Simple English Wikipedia. I will comment further at Wikipedia_talk:Simple_English_Wikipedia. Geometry guy 

I read the Simple's front page and didn't find it explicit enough (for me, but I could be a thicky).  Possibly it's because it's been obvious before what it's for, and now that there's a variety of intro articles on En.wiki and discussion of some sort of policy or guideline, the gaps or lack of distinctions between SEW and intros are appearing.  Note that I've also spammed the discussion here, if you hadn't already seen it.    
That's a good idea. The SEW front page is no help: above, I wikilinked instead Simple:Wikipedia:Simple English Wikipedia, which is. Geometry guy

 Ragusa- Dubrovnik- has never been in Italy!
This article's statement in the part of """"Maratime Republics"""" claiming that Ragusa was in Italy and therefore implying that it was an Italian republic is clearly a mistake.
One just needs to go into the Sponza palace, the Ragusian state archive in Dubrovnik and see any of the official documents. The laws regarding inner policy are clearly stated in Croatian: Those regarding foreign policy are written both in Croatian and Italian. All of the ruling families of Ragusa from Sorkocevic to Gucetic to Restic etc were Croatian. The greatest Ragusian poet and writer Ivan Gundulic, an aristocrat and one of the rulers, famous for his book """"Suze sina razmetnoga"""", was one of the greatest Croatian nationalists.  Source: """"Dubrovnik, a history"""", written by Robin Harris 2006.
According to the Robert Harris book Malta was independent until 1808 when Napoleon annexed it. According to Harris Dubrovnik with it's fleet of 700.000 tons (surpassing Venice in 1660) was the main hated rival of Venice in the Adriatic and always resisted the invasion plans of Venice. The last Venitian rector was sent home packing- politely but firmly- in 1351. According to Harris the recto packed his belongings in a hurry.

Some reflections  on this issue are necessary

First, it is necessary a reflection on the very concepts of Nation and State as these two terms are commonly considered near-synonyms and therefore used interchangeably. They have, instead different meanings. The term Italy refers to booth meanings. Italy as State was born in XIX cent, but Italy as Natiom is much older. Almost true, Ragusa never belonged to Italy-State except the Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy (1808-1809), but was seen for some centuries a part of Italy-Nation in the beginning of its birth process. Today Ragusa/Dubrovink, as well as Split and other Dalmatian towns, are out of Italy-State and out of Italy-Nation as well, they belong both to Croatia-Nation and to Croatia-State. On the other hand Lugano (Switzerland) and San Marino (independent republic) are out of Italy-State and still part of Italy-Nation. I suggest the book: L. TOMAZ, """"Il confine d'Italia in Istria e Dalmazia. Duemila anni di storia"""" and the SSRN working paper: ARNALDO MAURI, Historical, Geopolitical and Economic Factors affecting State and Nation Boundaries: Foreword on Italy's Borders in Istria and Dalmatia.,  Of course, Ragusa as port city had a multiethnic population: besides Italians also Croats, Vlachs, Serbs, Albanians. Similar situations could be found in Istanbul, Alexandria, Izmir, Odessa. To be the birthplace of poets or outstanding men is insignificant. Tommaseo was born in Dalmatia, as many other great Italians, Garibaldi and Massena were born in Nice, the Greek poet Kavafis in Alexandria. Venice was rival of Ragusa, but was also rival of Genoa on the sea and of Milan on the mainland; also this point is insignificant to the discussion on Ragusa belonging to Italy-Nation in past centuries.87.9.19.187

 Italian 

Hey Sajoch, if you can discuss things relaxed for a bit, I do have a question I'd like to ask a Ladin from Bolzano.  I always hear about the Italians coming and taking over.  But, can you explain to me who exactly are """"the Italians""""?  As far as I know, Italian in the modern sense is simply a citizen of the Italian Republic.  Going back a few hundred years ago, I suppose people might say they are a people """"of Italy"""", or the Italic peninsula.  But, I'd say that even to this day, many people in Italy don't refer to themselves as Italian first.  Aren't the people of Sicily, Sicilians?  The people of Napoli, Napolitani?  As far as I can tell, the """"Ladin"""" are the people of the region we happen to call Trentino-Alto Adige, and also the Romansch speakers in Switzerland are speaking essentially the same (or a VERY similar) language.  It would make sense that this pocket of Europe has its own particular language, and a language which is old-Latin based.  So, when you say you are Ladin, and not Italian... to me that is no different from someone saying they are Sicilian, and not Italian.  Then that brings me back to my original question: who is actually Italian?  Isn't the Italian language the Tuscan language actually?  So are Italians actually the people from Tuscany?  I know that Trentino is said to be majority Italian, but the people there speak Italian in modern times because it is the national language.  They still speak their original dialects like Nones, Solardo, etc.. which are actually Ladin languages.  You know that, right?  So are the people in Trentino Ladin people, or have they transformed into Italians because the Italian Republic has a National Language?  I'm just throwing these questions out there, as someone interested in my own history.  I mentioned this once to noclador, """"who are the Italians?"""" and all the discussion got me was him giving me the link to the Wikipedia page on Italians.  My guess is that some of the questions I was asking blurred the lines of a politics he would rather dream is black and white.

"Class for birds 

I love birds and would not want to ruin or vandalise their articles.  I just want people to know correct information on birds.  All Wikipedia bird articles have class Aves and this is not true. I am not inserting incorrect information, but birds have been scientifically identified as reptiles and are now in Class Reptilia.  I learned this from my Biology class and it is stated in my Campbell Reece Biology 8th Edition.

 a few suggestions on """"Measuring economic worth over time"""" 

I fully realize that this is a work in progress but thought a few suggestions could be useful. I'll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:

 Please don't take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid """"academic phrasing"""" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example """"social cost"""" or """"social production"""".
 Speaking of """"social production"""" it'd be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by """"proportions of social production"""" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you're equivocating between """"economic worth"""" and """"social worth"""" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I'm probably coming at this from a different background I'm wondering what exactly is the relationship between """"social product"""" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.
 """"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people."""" - I'm not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really """"inherently"""" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn't seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don't think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern """"working class people"""". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of """"economic worth"""" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.
 Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren't really related. For example the question """"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?"""" is not obviously or directly related to the question """"what was the social power of capital in 1840?"""".
 Some ideas for expansion: """"Theoretical problems"""" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). """"Wage price series"""" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I'm not sure what a """"real price"""" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there's also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There's also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don't really constitute a series but do provide """"snapshot"""" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.

I'd really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so I thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better. Thanks.  """,0

 Gregory Gilligan Rust (Reporter) 

Greg Rust (born 19 July 1970 in Sydney) is an Australian Formula One expert and commentator with Network Ten, a commercial TV network. He has also worked for the Nine Network and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) as a freelance commentator/reporter/presenter, mainly covering motorsport (auto racing).  Colleagues and fans call him """"Rusty"""" or """"Thruster"""" (a nickname given to him by the late Barry Sheene a former World Motorcycle Champion).
 Radio career 

Worked for 3 years with the Macquarie Radio Network  stations 2GB and 2CH in Sydney initially as a sport reporter and later became daytime news reader.

 Television career 

After cutting his teeth with SBS motorsport program Speedweek, Rust was drafted into Channel 9's commentary team for the final Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix at the Eastern Creek Raceway in 1996. He called the support races with 1980 F1 World Champ Alan Jones. In 1997 he was hired by Ten to host the Australian Super Touring Championship for 2-litre Touring Cars - a position previously held by his close friend Leigh Diffey who had moved on to Network Ten's V8 Supercar coverage.  Rust commentated the Aust. Super Touring Championship for 2 years before starting work as V8 pit reporter late in '98. He was a part of Ten's V8 coverage for almost 10 years - even hosting and anchoring the commentary on occasions.  During this period the station won numerous Logie Awards for its broadcast of the famous Bathurst 1000 and Rusty developed a reputation as a pit specialist also working on the Gold Coast Champ Car race and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne. Despite an offer to join the Seven Network in 2007, Rust stayed with Ten to front the station's MotoGP and F1 broadcasts and its long running magazine motorsport show RPM.  He also hosts and commentates Ten's coverage of the Red Bull Air Race series.

 Racing background 

Born into a family with a genuine love for all forms of motorsport, he was a regular at the Sydney Showground Speedway before he could even walk   and an amateur racer who started out in Karts.  In his late teens and early 20’s, Rust enjoyed some class wins as a driver in rallysprints and khana-crosses.  He has also driven V8 Supercars, Formula Holden, Formula Ford, Toyota Racing Series and Speedcars/Midgets for story research.

"Ultradense deuterium
The article has a section on ultradense deuterium. This raises the same questions that have been discussed extensively on the talk page of Rydberg matter. This is fringe science promoted by a guy named Leif Holmlid, who co-authors papers along with cold fusion kooks such as Hora and Miley.

Article issues
This article has some issues that need to be addressed. The first is that of notability. As it is now, the article fails to establish any notability. It is merely a plot summary and, as was explained numerous times at Talk:List of NCIS episodes, Wikipedia is not for plot summaries. It is likely that each individual episode of a television series will not be notable on its own. As per WP:PLOT, """"a concise plot summary is appropriate as part of the larger coverage of a fictional work"""", but on its own the plot does not establish notability. As it says in the {{notability}} tag that kepps getting removed, notability needs to be established by adding reliable, secondary sources. At the moment, there are none. More on this later.

The plot summary in this article is not concise by any means. It needs to be pruned and appropriate information concerning """"the reception, impact, and significance"""" of the episode must be added.

A third issue is that of references. I've already mentioned that reliable, secondary sources do not exist in the article. Of the two references that do exist in the article, one is a primary source. The other (cbsncis.wetpaint.com) is a fan wiki that anyone can edit and so it is not a reliable source. Open wikis such as cbsncis.wetpaint.com are questionable, self-published sources and are generally not acceptable. The expansion of this article will require much better sources.   """,0
"I think there's some confusion over numbers of the complete glasses.

Annoyingly, I don't have access to Jstor so can't check the rest of the articles cited to see if they elaborate.  Also, for the fragments - where there is more than one fragment, it's not made explicit what the minimum number of glasses represented by those fragments is, as far as I can see. 10 fragments doesn't necessarily = 10 different glasses. 81.147.148.65",0

Notability of James Cunningham(developer)

 POV article name 

""""Constitutional crisis"""" doesn't seem neutral to me. Also, it's ambiguous). The focus on the """"Constitution"""" seems to imply one or two things:
 That the """"crisis"""" was about Zelaya pushing ahead with a referendum the Supreme Court opined was unconstitutional.
 That the """"crisis"""" was about the lack of a clear cut constitutional procedure for impeaching a president, therefore implying that the coup was justified.

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

"""A few ideas to balance the US centric style.

Whilst you have brought in large area of British (mainly English and Welsh) facts neverthe less the opening paragraphs are somewhat US based.  I have no knowledge whatsoever on anything other than the UK perspective (though as this contributes significantly to US law, it will at least set some history.  

I am also a little bit concerned at why juries were created in the first place, you state that this is because they are believed to be free from bribery. Historically, trial by jury arose because of the difficulties of securing trial by ordeal, due to a change in church law.  By that time juries already sat to decide if there was a primae facie case to answer (the modern equivalent being Grand Juries).

The history of trial by jury (in England and hence the US) is related to several important events, most notebly the Assizes of Clarendon, the Fourth Lantern Council and the Magna Carta.

It may be useful for you to have a look at some of the wikipedia sites listed below:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal

""""In the Assize of Clarendon, enacted in 1166 and the first great legislative act in the reign of the English Angevin King Henry II, the law of the land required that: """"anyone, who shall be found, on the oath of the aforesaid [a jury], to be accused or notoriously suspect of having been a robber or murderer or thief, or a receiver of them ... be taken and put to the ordeal of water.""""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council

Canons 14-18. Rules on the conduct of the clergy including against such things as: non-celibate living, drunkenness, frequenting taverns, hunting, conducting trials by ordeal or combat 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta

Though you may be best considering the uk statute site which says:
http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519

""""NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor [X5 condemn him,] but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.""""

"Note to admins considering unblock 

I'm indifferent. I have work to do on-wiki, but I also have plenty to do off-wiki.

 In comedy 

Deleted the """"In Comedy"""" section: it adds nothing to an understanding of Jack Ruby, and distracts from the rest of the article. Any significant influence by Ruby upon comedy could be placed in the Popular Culture section; any Ruby-related jokes are gratuitous at best.   

 In the popular culture section: NOFX reference 

I don't think the reference to the NOFX song """"The Man I Killed"""" being about Jack Ruby is correct.

 Nixon-Ruby connection  
A number of sources claim that there was some sort of connection between Jack Ruby and Richard Nixon (  ). Even if this is all conspiracy nonsense, it should be somehow addressed in this article so people looking for information on the connection can get the truth and won't continue on to some other less reliable source .  
(learn to spell...)

I've seen a physical piece of paper (which of course I couldn't yet scan) at the National Archives in the 70s. (My father was a good friend of E. Raymond Lewis, Librarian of the House of Representative IIRC, and I would hang out talking to whomever while they met.) Rubenstein had been subpeonaed by McCarthy's Subcommitee on Investigations; Nixon sent a note (which is what I saw) saying that Ruby had been working for him in a confidential capacity and it would be unacceptable to question him in public (I forget the exact wording); the subpoena was revoked. I think the paper might have been in the congressional record.

See WP:NOR, crank.   

 I've got a xerox copy of that document, and it has a zip code on the FBI letterhead.  That's a bit of a problem, since there were no zip codes when it was supposedly was written.  It's actually widely admitted to be a forgery.  John McAdams

 A case has been made for explaining the ZIP code  that the one-page xerox is really a composite of 2 different documents. The top (on FBI letterhead) is a half-page undated typed note (""""NOTE: Extra copy. Inclosure not verified by official report. Return to file. This is sensitive.""""), used as a transmittal sheet, stapled on top of full page underneath. Only the bottom half of the full sheet dated 1947 is seen.  If this is correct, the presence of the ZIP code on the letterhead need not affect the dating of the bottom half. See discussion here.  

First let me say I don't know how to add new sections on Wiki or Wiki Talk pages so I'm putting this here even though it's not related to Nixon; It's related to JFK's VP, Lyndon B. Johnson. I'm absolutely speechless after looking through this article that Johnson's name isn't mentioned, anywhere, considering he WAS Kennedy's running mate, and there's a very famous picture of Johnson smiling at a man off in the crowd who is winking back to Johnson as if they're sharing some secret joke *while Johnson has his hand on a bible and is being sworn in.* And I think it's a very possible motive for having JFK assassinated; he *would* and *did* advance to the presidency upon JFK's assassination.

Something else I found that I stumbled across using StumbleUpon.com was that (according to the articles i read, which were full of hotlinks to other information around the web) according to that author, all 4 presidents who'd been assassinated *were* assassinated because they opposed 'central' banking or 'artificial' banking (not sure what the proper term would be), that is, the fact that the Federal Reserve is a privately owned corporation which prints money for a fraction of the cost of the face values of what they print. Something to think about.

I'll go look through my stumbleupon history to see if I can find the article I'm talking about in the previous paragraph, but there are quotes by Lincoln and Kennedy talking about how they were against the 'Federal Reserve' for lack of a better term, I'm not sure what it was called historically, I doubt it was always call",0

GA Sweeps Review: On Hold

If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at WP:GAN. Here are the points that need to be addressed:
Expand the lead to better summarize the article. It should mention a little bit about each heading within the article. The current two sentences isn't sufficient in describing the article. For guidelines, see WP:LEAD. The first paragraph in the background sections reads like part of the lead, consider rewording part of it and merging it into the current lead.
""""Many subsequent historians have considered the causes of the duel to be flimsy and have thus either characterized Hamilton as """"suicidal"""", Burr as """"malicious and murderous,"""" or both."""" Single sentence shouldn't stand alone. Either expand on it or incorporate it into another paragraph. Go through the rest of the article and fix any other occurrences.
""""When the original pistol was examined, the concealed hair trigger was discovered. (Reference: """"Pistols shed light on famed duel,"""" Smithsonian magazine, November 1976)"""" This reference should be converted to an inline citation.

I very sincerely appreciate that Xoloz. I was thinking to myself earlier """"I need a wiki-hug"""". I've tried my absolute best to approach everything I do on Wikipedia with the most professional attitude I can. I feel under assault from Kelly, and at this point do not know how to resolve it. I could generate a very large, detailed response to Kelly's assertions regarding my conduct but at this point I despair that it would do anything but fan the flames, and honestly I don't know if I have the energy for it. With that in mind, I earlier tried to push myself above the trees and think, """"What do we want to come from this?"""" and that was my motivation in my recent addition of a question to Kelly on the RfC. I well recognize that there are simply too many people on Wikipedia for everyone to like you, or you to like everyone. I even noted this to someone else recently. Unfortunately, I think I've found my first oil/water person in Kelly. I respect her work on Wikipedia, but I feel badly abused by her actions with respect to me. I asked her to bring the RfC to help bring closure to this, but now I am uncertain it will have any beneficial effect. Even if the RfC closes with a view against Kelly, it doesn't resolve the dispute. Kelly will still view me as a """"problem admin"""", and will continue to consider me such with her """"trusted peers"""" as she put it. So, whether this RfC concludes in my favor or not, I still lose. I fear the only possible conclusion to this that might at least stop the debate is an oath by both of us not to comment on the actions of the other.

Jesus and Messianic Prophecy
Hey, you removed my addition to this section. I don't get it. You were vague, and mentioned how you didn't like my use of the word """"retort"""". I wasn't trying to instigate some sort of battle between Jews and Christians or something, I was just reporting what the Christian counterargument is to certain Jewish opinions about Jesus (and note- I had referenced Bible passages). It is true- the Bible contains no time-line or deadline for the prophecies to work with. (If there is one then why don't you cite your source?) And the New Testament does give reasons as to why Jesus hasn't fulfilled certain prophecies, and talks about how he'll get to them later (eg, he will usher in the Messianic era of peace/God's kingdom after the apocalypse, as detailed in Revelation).

What really bugs me is how you allow, and even restored, false claims about Christianity on this page. There is a line that says, """"Contrary to the Christian belief that the Kingdom of God is not worldly..."""". I deleted it and explained how all the gospels, several epistles and the book of Revelation talk about how the coming kingdom of God IS going to be a literal physical thing on earth after a physical resurrection of the dead.

 they've been desecrating the Koran all along

I'd like this Wikipedia article to remain scrupulously neutral on the issue of whether the descration story is true.

(Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being """"confrontational"""" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.

The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.

So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.

on the Creator
The demiurge is an expression of philosophy, in that it is a Greek or Hellenistic cultural concept. This means that the Demiurge is a cultural concept from the Greeks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingness as non-substantive (ex-nihilo). They treated nothingness as a substance called aether. The Greeks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from """"something"""". Plato it was the good, Aristotle it was energy, Plotinus it was force. These are ontological noema that create consciousness in humans. This arises from the unique essence of Greek or Hellenistic philsophy treating the natural (physic) and supernatural (metaphysic) as extensions of human consciousness. So everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousness and therefore must be expressed from a anthropomorphic perspective. God or Gods can not be anything outside of human. That's why Zeus and the Gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them. The demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates. The Greek Orthodox Christian God is not relatiable to the Actus et potentia as the Roman Catholic God since, God in essence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make God's being, essence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the Ortohodox Christian God. The Christian God is not one (the monad) or unity according to St Dionysus the Areopagite.   
Orthodox Christianity did not have the same God therefore the """"concept of God"""" uses and has familiar language (between Hellenstic Greek and Byzantine Greek) but in essence, substance is a different concept of God. In Greek Orthodox Christianity (which Iamblichus kinda tried to graft into Neoplatonism after the fact) God is in and outside the Universe. God is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since God's consciousness ontologically is hyper-being. Meaning that God as a substance can not be detected nor contained. Now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis, immanence or existence (cataphatic). The Pagan philosophical God was a detectable substance that all things derive from and reduced to. The Orthodox Christian God is a hyper substance that is not empirically detectable. Mankind has to be altered in order to detect it. Since the God in Greek Orthodox Christianity in his trinitarian completeness (uncreatedness) does not have the same consciousness as mankind, did not share mankinds consciousness until he became a human being AKA Jesus Christ. The reverse is only true in Philosophy since in Orthodox Christianity God as a whole has a consciousness which is completely unrelatable to mankind. Philosophy God and mankind have the same consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Protestantism treat God ontologically very much as modalistic (like Sabellianism) which creates also a different consciousness. Orthodox Christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic-izing the Christian God, which can only come from not actually having experiencing the Christian God (theoria) and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic God of philosophy.

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's. 

Fuck Black Dahlia Murder, I'm not giving up....this is insane, I'm not letting you mother fuckers take away the one thing I have that you haven't ruined.""",1

First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world. Idiots like you will also complain how your own press are not independent.,1

MAGHASITO 2

USer:Maghasito try to spread of pseudo science, the so-called Hungarian Turanism , which is now a politically motivated chauvinist pseudo-science from the 19th century and a core agenda of far right Jobbik party and ww2 nazi Arrow Cross Party . There are not a single contemporary scholar (academics university professors) linguistics, historian, population geneticist on this planet, who support that fantasy theory. Wikikpedia is a free encyclopedia, however it is not the place of the popularization of pseudo-scientific politically-motivated fantastic nonsenses. The best option would be the permanent ban of Maghasito. Thank you! 

I believe that he is from a worker class family (as most of the Turanist believers), he migrated to UK or USA as a an economic-refugee due to the economic crisis. Many of this turanist boys read the esoteric pseudo-scientific  books of the so-called self-appointed turanist """"shaman-scholars"""". These shaman """"scholars"""" are usually electricians, blacksmiths, masons, car-mechanic in the real life, so they have no any university degrees. These less educated worker-class boys admired them as knowledgeable expert. Just read our discussions in the talkpage of Hungarian turanism: Forexample he consider Ferenc Zajti (shaman-scholar) as one of the greatest historian, Zajti was who invented the theory of Parthian - Hungarian Jesus. (according to Zajti Jesus Christ was not a Jew but a proto-Hungarian). These turan-believer-boys are often racist, they consider the Indo-Europeans and Semitic people and their culture as inferior and subhuman who created a very low primitive culture, and they consider the culture and race of Central Asian nomadic Turkic people as superior culture and race.

Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello, Wikid77 here. I am contacting a few admins about this. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:
 """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.
 """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.
 """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.
 """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.
 """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.
I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  """,0

Maybe there's not a thing like the Jewish nationality (any more), as the autochtone inhabitants of Judea fled their country, when it came to defending it, and since then spread all over the world.

There are also East-African-born persons, who are to a certain extent Jewish in racial sence.  But if that was'nt the case with this person, than a question is, in how far she's still ethnically Jewish, since Gdorb obviously doesn't """"have that girlfriend"""" any more.

Why should one (use instruments to) disregard one's own or somebody else's race?
Race is a biological reality and in principle there's nothing in it, that gives reason to disregard it. On the contrary, one might say. Many, if not most, people are proud of their race. If some prefer to disregard it, than a question is, for what reason they do.

 """"Peace and tolerance"""" are underpinned by their belief that muslims should unite against their common enemy which they believe is Western dominance of Islamic Ummah, in particular US and Israeli domination/occupation. This resonates with the call by the late founder of Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini for Islamic unity and resistance against the West, and that's also one reason the Houthis are claimed to be supported or influenced by Iran. The other ground for their tolerance is their opposition to Salafism/Al-Qaeda which is widely known as an intolerant, extremist and terrorist Islamic group which has engaged in sectarian infighting and division in the Islamic Ummah rather than staging any real, honorable resistance against Western domination. They have in fact destroyed the public image of Islam by committing all sorts of wrongs and excesses such as indiscriminate violence against non-Salafists and non-mulims and pretty much anyone who doesn't adopt their ideology. I'm elaborating on this to help better make sense of the Houthi ideology and such characterizations offered by the Yemeni professor. Also see how this is in line with the Newsweek identification of Houthi descent cause as being shared by all Yemenis. Houthis are genuinely inspired by Shia Islam but that's also exactly why they are striving for indiscriminate well-being of all muslims. You need to study about Shia Islam to understand this, especially Shia distinct appreciation for reason and universal justice.    """,0

"Hi Kuwar,

The reason I flagged it as needing additional citations for verification is that several of the major expressways listed in the article don't have any citations such as the Mumbai - Pune Expressway, Greater Noida Expressway, Western Freeway (Mumbai), KMP Expressway, Nat'l Expressway 2 as well as most of the planned expressways. What I propose is that the section be condensed so that only the major highways are dicussed in detail and have some helpful pictures while the minor highways (let's say, length < 25km) are listed on the chart but we don't go into too much detail. This way, we can link to all the expressways in the country but only list the important ones in the article. My proposed layout for the article would look like:

 Existing expressways 
(Chart here) - this chart would list only existing expressways in the country much like what you've added. One more suggestion I would make is to have the ability to sort by length.
 Major Expressways 
 Mumbai-Pune Expressway 
Insert details here, a few pictures would be nice
 National Expressway 1 
discuss further
 Sion Panvel Expressway 
discuss, another picture would be nice too
 Delhi Gurgaon Expressway 
elaborate further

 Planned Expressways 
This chart should list planned expressways as well as those under construction. It should have a separate colour coded column that denotes the current staus (i.e. proposed, approved, under construction etc.).
The section below should talk about major planned projects like the Ganga Expressway, Yamuna Expressway, NE2, KMP expressway etc.

"No problem mate, a professional registered website on the True Story of Ronald Ryan is almost completed. Purrum won't be able to contribute trash, lies, allegations, accusations, opinions, views, on the Ryan case. 
Purrum's infamous promotional book-for-profits The Hanged Man (pages 221 & 222) confirms Purrum as a compulsive and manipulative liar. That's a fact!
The book states; The discrepencies in eyewitnesses evidence were substancial and wide-ranging. Each of the fourteen eyewitnesses testified different accounts of what they saw. Some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the East of Hodson and some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the West of Hodson. Some eyewitnesses testified seeing smoke coming from Ryan's rifle, although it was established by an expert on forensic ballistics Senior Sergeant Colin Letherbarrow, who testified that the cartridges used were of a smokeless variety. (Eleven eyewitnesses testified they saw Ryan armed with a rifle. All fourteen eyewitnesses testified of hearing one single shot and Hodson fell to the ground. More significantly, only FOUR eyewitnesses testified actually seeing Ryan fire a shot. The was no contest that the evidence of each eyewitness were very contradictory. Purrum's infamous book goes on to describe the discrepencies in the prosecution's case, eg. the lack of scientific forensic evidence, the vital missing pieces of evidence, the downward trajectory angle of the fatal bullet, and prison officer Paterson testifying he fired the single shot that was heard by all eyewitnesses.

Hmmm, but the situation there (Madrid, and Spain in general...) is also not so good now. The unnemployment is huge! My favourite place in Spain is Benalmadena a costal town near Marbella where all the cool Spanish people use to go, because Marbella is too turistic, and Benalmadena was still undiscouvered by the """"people"""" or mass tourism. Another reason are the great golf courses that are near. P.S.:You said in your comment """"we are just a little bit richer"""", it can´t apply to Serbia, because it´s way much poorer than in the 80´s. Yugoslav Serbia was way better. There was freedom to travel (to Yugoslav citizens wasn´t even required visas for majority of western countries) and had, limited throu, private property or companies. We had the EURO in 1976, Olympic winter games in 1984, the non-alignement was a very interesting initiative... Younger people (even in Serbia too) doesn´t know much of that. Almost all Serb families had a house on the Adriatic, going skiing was usual, travelling to Austrian or Swiss Alps, to Italy or Spain in summer, was """"normal"""" to many Belgraders. I see you been to South Serbia (Niš and Leskovac), but you should have in mind that Belgrade and the northern part was and is way more richer (double, or even more). About the separatism, it was a huge error (for Serbia) not to allow to Croatia and Slovenia to be independent during the monarchic period. All the rest of the country was suposed to belong to Serbia (call me nationalist, but that is a fact). Even Yugoslavia was created so there wouldn´t be a """"big"""" orthodox Kingdom of Serbia. Neither Vatican, Austria, Germany or Turkey, neither France and UK (with excuse of the possibility of that Serbia becoming a allied of Russia) wanted that, so a """"neutral"""" Yugoslavia was imposed. About the Serbian-Bulgarian problem, it all begin when Serbia was not allowed to have direct access to see, so it had to be compensated with lands, part of current Macedonia, that were suposed to belong to Bulgaria. I know and recognise that. You have the maps on the page (Kingdom of Serbia) where you see that the Serbo-Bulgarian border was moved east, so that Albaian state was created. All current Eastern Macedonia was given to Serbia as compensation for taking Albania from Serbia. We could talk centuries about it, wright?   """,0

"de Moivre's formula is currently grossly incorrect 

My corrections were perfectly valid whereas the previous (and now current) version of the page are wrong in their majority. For proof that de Moivre's theorem is true for all ℚ at the very least (though no actual proof is given) please see pg 36 of book with ISBN number: 978-0-435519-21-6. Un-fortuitously I am unaware of any books that provide a proof beyond an integer power but I have already provided a proof and if you find that insufficient I can provide you with other internet sources that cite it. I can understand and forgive a non-mathematical page containing errors as non-mathematical phenomena are not clear cut nor are they ever entirely obvious and often it is plausible to find support for all sets of contradicting information. However this is not the case with mathematics which is the only subject that can have all of its information conclusively proved or disproved. As such maths should never be quoted incorrectly in any Wikipedia article as it is extremely black and white, i.e; things are either purely correct or incorrect and as it stands my corrections were correct whereas the current page reversion is not. I am amazed at how this page is able to pertain information of such mass, gross inaccuracy especially given the simplicity of de Moivre's theorem and the prerequisites needed to understand it. It is after all something that all students of complex numbers by extension of studying further mathematics learn at the age of 16 in England, UK. Though I appreciate that even a graduate of a masters in mathematics may be mis-informed on this subject given that they have never studied complex numbers but as such they should not consider themselves versed enough to be able to misinform others by way or publishing erroneous statements in this article.

Just saying that we don't know that 47 kills the canary, particularly since the sound is more like the snapping of fingers then the breaking of a creature's neck. Any comments?",0

I agree to some of your claims and appreciate your suggestions but I would like to point out that you have removed literally all statistics and some of them are clearly appropriate. I've deliberately put life expectancy """"in comparison to other advanced economies"""" to make it clear - the comparisons give a clear indication of the progress S Korea has made and is not a POV. You can find such comparisons in almost all economy section of country articles, such as that one in Portugal. In other words, some comparisons are appropriate and should not be completely removed. As I say, you reverted all of my edits, so I did agree with some of your edits, which I left out or reworded in an appropriate manner. I do agree with the picky statistics, and removed comparisons in industrial outputs. For all comparisons made, I included reason why it is made, so it is made clear that it is not a POV. Some of your claims are vague, such as """"due to its healthy manufacturing base"""", which clearly points to original research. You have also removed the IMF forecasts without a valid reason, which is clearly appropriate to show where S Korea is heading right now and useful in demonstrating the speed at which it is growing. I do agree to the technology section and removed some comparisons. My point is that you can't remove all the statistics just because you/or some Wikipedia readers think it is making comparisons - achievements should be recognized and the best way to do so is through comparison. If you have an issue with my new edit, please feel free to talk to me but be very specific about what you disagree with. Thanks.   """,0

Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view demands both stories side by side

Any material that is challenged and for which no source is provided may be removed by any editor. So we don't need a poll, all we need is to remove a lot of things from the page. It needs to be rewritten having both published versions, the scientific one and the warmongering story.

In October 2004, Rodríguez filed a civil RICO lawsuit directed against George W. Bush, Richard B. Cheney, Donald H.

The government filed a motion to dismiss, or at least transfer, the case on grounds of national security. is worthy of it's own paragraph.

no Osama means no Muslims
[FBI says]: The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 thus the word Muslim may only be quoted at best.

The use of the word terrorist
Similarities between the Reichstag fire and The September 11 Attacks are as striking as those between the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Patriot act there is no need to use the word terrorist to explain the event, I do think a separate paragraph dedicated to the media calling it a Muslim terrorist attack would be appropriate.

Structural failure
In a well-designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure.

Which makes this pseudoscience: September_11_attacks#The_attacks: Three buildings in the World Trade Center Complex collapsed due to structural failure on the day of the attack. Because that is not what the structural failure of well designed systems works like in any previous historical event. Here the standards of wikipedia go far beyond those of the mainstream media. The buildings where blown up.

In the section Levellers#Origin_of_name there is the following text:

On the 11th of November 1647 the King Charles R send a message to the Speaker of the House of Lords in which he talks about the Levellers, this is a letter in which he states that he is forced to flee from Hampton Court. The King arrived on the Isle of Wight on the 14th and stays with the Governor Robert Hammond. And as the King was effectively being held a prisoner by Colonel HammondCharles_I_of_England#English_Civil_war long after the 16th. 
Which made me wonder who started selling the book, and whether the book was sold despite or because of the tumult. As this all occurs in between the First English Civil War, which ended May of 1646, and the Second English Civil War. Naturally at the time 'His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration' was published there was no foresight that predicted the Second English Civil War, but it might be considered slightly inflammatory. And although I don't doubt the book is genuine, it is plain that Charles I had little to do with the sale as he was on the Isle of Wight.

Lansing in """"Southern Michigan""""?
I think not. What is the source or justification for this apparently arbitrary decision? I say """"apparently arbitrary"""" because I can find no evidence that the regions of Michigan are official governmental designations.

 The media (Lansing State Journal, and TV Stations WLNS, WILX, WSYM)
all refer to Lansing as being in Mid-Michigan.

 A Google search for the terms Lansing and """"Mid Michigan"""" turns up many hits that would lead one to believe that Lansing is a part of """"Mid-Michigan.

 Conversely, a Google search for Lansing and """"Southern Michigan"""" turns up mostly references where Lansing happens to be mentioned in the same work as a reference to something outside of the Lansing area (in Southern Michigan).

 There are a number of businesses and organizations based in Lansing with """"Mid-Michigan"""" in their title. In the Lansing phone book, I find at least 50 businesses listed whose name begins with """"Mid-Michigan"""" (or """"Mid Michigan""""). I find one whose name begins with """"Southern Michigan"""".

I would argue that the boundary between """"Mid"""" (or Central) and """"Southern"""" Michigan lies somewhere south of Lansing and somewhere just north of Jackson. Perhaps [Leslie, Michigan|Leslie]] is nearer the border. I believe that once could safely draw the border to include all of Ingham County.

On these grounds, I suggest that in the name of factual accuracy, Lansing be moved (at least in Wikipedia) from """"Southern Michigan"""" to """"Central Michigan"""" (for which """"Mid-Michigan"""" is said to be a synonym).   """,0

""":Moncrief, do you even know what a shepherd is? I used to work on a cattle ranch, so I know a bit about this stuff. To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, """"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others."""" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.

I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a """"rodeo cowboy"""" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd.

First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...

 Sich riflemen/Urainian Sich Riflemen/Ukranian socutss 

Hi Chris

I am responding to ensure clarification in this matter

""""Ukrainian Sich riflemen"""" (1914-1920)refers to a unit of the Hungarian army
""""Sich riflemen"""" (1917-1919)refers to events when some of the the unit went to Kyiv and started a different group by absorbing local fighters and the youth organisation

As you can see these are military units, or at least para military, and so are not really related to the scouting movement, more related to the military term scout - someone who knows a lot about the local area and is used for forwards observation. These scout units established in Europe during the first part of the 20th century were not really akin to the modern day scout units. They were paramilitary units designed for living off the land and defending the homeland during times of war or invasion.
It may be that you are wishing to start a """"Ukranian Scouts page"""" to support the modern day scouting movement since the fall of the USSR, there is not one so if that was your wish I am sure that would be OK

OIT does not say that """"PIE=Vedic"""", this is what the bulk of naive Hindu patriots (and I do not include Nobleeagle in their number) do not get. Elst's """"semi-reasonable"""" OIT """"emerging model"""" (""""emerging"""" being a way of saying that nobody believes in it """"yet"""") would mean that the Mature IVC was the home of Proto-Indo-Iranian, which isn't """"Vedic"""". The Vedic period begins with the RV, which would date to later than 1900 BC in both OIT and AIM models. 
Nobleeagle: yes, I said I would be willing to present OIT as a reasonable alternative on similar footing as the Anatolian hypothesis, which is itself  rather fringy and mainly advocated by a single scholar.

I agree all your points are valid ones, and probably addressing all of them is an impossibility, but all of that might be considered overly critical. An article like this, I think the only way it could meet the standards you've just set forth (which, theoretically, are all standards wikipedia is supposed to set forth) would be to completely neuter the article the way the List of Internet phenomena was recently. 
The MAIN problem is the one you raised about subjectivity. I don't believe there's any single standard that could truly be used to qualify what is an """"unusual death"""", certainly not across the board for all types of death, and certainly not one which would be sourcable. I think, even above Original Research, it can be understood that the circumstances surrounding the demise of someone like, say, Michael Malloy, it can be understood that the vast majority of people would have no problem qualifying it as """"unusual"""". But, reasonable expectation for popular agreement is not a consistent standard. So I simply do not know how to solve this particular problem.
If I were being completely objective, I would say all of your points raised are totally valid, and satisfactorily answering all of them is an impossibility, which would mean the article should be considered for deletion. But, subjectively, I like the article and feel it does serve a purpose, and if there is a way of answering any of your points, I'd like to try. """,0

 Request opinion of Muslim editor 

Hello. Could you please stop by Talk:Christianity and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word 'monotheism' should be included in the intro to the Christianity article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is The dogma or belief that there is one God. Now, all Christians believe there is one God and all Christian creeds (such as the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Creed) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the Holy Trinity. Christians believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit all make up one [[Ousia|essense] of God, i.e. are three parts of one God (known as hypostasis). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of Tawhidand they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but [[tritheistic]we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the Islam article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on belief, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, they are by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say """"Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers."""" Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it's basically like saying """"Christianity believes it believes that there is one God,"""" which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition is the belief! None-the-less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as tritheistic? 2) If so, does this view affect that fact that Christians think their God is one God (even though they may not be right), and if not, aren't Christians by definition monotheistic? Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot of debate I had to summarize. Thanks, — """,0

That wasn't an appeal, of course. But I'm dissappointed Cailil. This reply was the sort of lazy, hackneyed tripe I would expect from the average joe that that hangs out at ANI, or from the sort of petty pointless admin who runs around dolling out the stock phrases like this and blocking socks without even bothering to look at the edits they make, the sort of admin where you can be sure that for 90% of their daily activites, thinking about whether they're even benefitting Wikipedia or not doesn't even enter their thought process. You just thanked Black Kite for the """"heads up"""", which you would never have even got if it wasn't for me, the evil rule breaker. What's up with that? Can you deal with that Cailil? Can you deal with the idea that someone like me can in your eyes be 'breaking a rule' on Wikipedia (which, I might add, you still haven't even proven), while also apparently benefitting it by shining a light on the continuing bad behaviour of HighKing. You can't in all seriousness expect to come here and expect me to listen to this sort of crap, when you've discredited it with your own actions elsewhere. I saw Jimbo talking recently about how he vehemently disagreed with someone's claim that Wikipedia was very bad at dealing with whistleblowers. What say you? Or is it all just rhetoric to you? You could unblock me yourself if you really wanted, nobody forced you to make this block. Not even Black Kite thought it was necessary, which is saying something, as he hands out blocks like confetti. I don't have any issue with promising you that the next time I want to make a complaint about HighKing, I'll use this account, if it satisfies your need to be able to track my history, if it satisfied your need to enfore a rule, even though doing so is entirely pointless in this case. But it's almost like you want people like me to sock, it's almost like you want me to break the rules, it's almost like you think it helps to have HighKing running around blaming all his woes on socks, when you know it's just one of many ways he tries to deflect attention from his own edits. What is the official story now, btw? He seems to have caught on to the fact that there is more than one person who is critical of him, yet you seem to be taking the retrograde step of going back to his old theory that we're all the same person. Can you really not see how your approach only exacerbates the issue? That it only makes eventual resolution less likely, or at least add another couple of years onto the final reckoning of just how well Wikipedia was able to deal with the sort of behaviour HighKing is by now the textbook example of. Or have you just been working around Sandstein for far too long, and you've completely lost your higher brain functions and can now only operate literally to the rule book as he does, the freak that he is. Maybe if you were truly honest about the fact that who we are doesn't make a blind bit of difference to whether or not you are doing what you should be with regard to HighKing, you wouldn't find yourself having to make these sort of replies, which must surely make you feel just that little bit shameful. You cannot really be happy that you feel have to say things like this to people like me, things that are so obviously intelectually dishonest that if it wasn't already the case, you just know we're not going to take a blind bit of notice of them? Because like it or lump it, whether you treat me as the enemy or as a whistle blower, I'm not going away, not until the HighKing situation is resolved one way or the other. And neither is anyone else by the looks of it. I don't even care if the resolution is that he becomes a good editor. That's how foolish it is for you to continue on this track. I'm not harassing HighKing in any way, shape or form, and you have still yet to establish whether I am an illegitimate sock or not.

Dear Mr. Chapman:

I write to you to request information regarding the blocking/banning of User:Mr Spunky Toffee, sockpuppet of User:Brian G. Crawford.

I was intrigued (but not altogether surprised) to discover a few days ago that he had been blocked as a sock-puppet, but I do know that he had a long history of personal attacks on other users.

What I would like to know is, what was it that got Brian G. Crawford banned from Wikipedia in the first place?  He is not listed on Wikipedia:List of banned users, nor is he included in the Category:Banned Wikipedia users.

I will understand if this information is confidential or otherwise unavailable; if this is the case please let me know on my talk page.

I had never thought that this double perplexing situation will be resolved so easily and successfully. I am very happy that all the Hindu leaders showed a great understanding and took a totally thoughtful and cooperative stance in the moment of this terrible and responsible situation so that we could arrive at a satisfactory solution to come out of this very complex situation. This could be possible only due to the struggle and vehement efforts made by Mahatma Gandhi for it. I was very surprised when Mahatma Gandhi accepted and gave assent to all my demands and even congratulated me. If he had adopted the same stand in the Second Round Table Conference, this difficult situation wouldn't have arisen. I am very happy to give acceptance and assent to this successful pact. If my Upper Caste brothers wholeheartedly accept and try to implement this pact, then I and my untouchable brothers would be very happy. On this occasion I do not hesitate to give credit to Sir Tejbahadur Sapru and C. Rajgopalachari besides Mahatma Gandhi for the success of this Pact.""""

Licinius, the more you explain your position, the more I think you're reading something into the current wording that just plain isn't there. Saying Aussie Rules is an Australian variety of football does not say that it is more Australian than """"gridiron"""" (NFL is the competition, not the game!) is American. It doesn't say that Australians haven't had great influence on rugby league. The descriptions of the sections don't need to be, and in fact shouldn't be in the same format, since the different groups are not exactly the same sort of groups. The different codes are grouped into sections based on their history and similarities between the codes. There are two very obvious big groups, both easily characterised by their """"ancestry"""" - the kicking games descended from association rules and the carrying games descended from the rugby rules. The rest of the codes, all relatively minor in global terms, cannot be characterised by a single ancestry, and so shouldn't be. They are a group of games, some influenced by both soccer-type games and rugby school rules, with various influences within the group as well, that are most easily characterised by the fact that they are all Australian or Irish in origin. Saying some of them are Australian varieties of football is not saying the rugby codes are  """"unAustralian"""" any more than calling Gaelic football an Irish variety implies that Irish soccer players are not Irish/Gaelic!

"Glaring evidentiary deficiency not reported herein wrt George Zimmerman's account of events 

Recent photos of Zimmerman shortly after the shooting made by the police show no blood spatter on his front including his shirt.  His account claims that Martin was directly over him when he shot him.  Yet a 9mm hollow point wound in Martin's front chest would be expected to shower blood all over Zimmerman.  This evidence clearly contradicts Zimmerman's account.  Another report indicates that the shot was fired from more than 18 inches away.  This contrary evidence and contradiction in Zimmerman's story should be noted in this wiki article.  Speculation is that Zimmerman achieved standing (off the ground from a lying down position) status after Martin's struggled with him and then shot him with his 9mm as payback for the beating upon himself which he had apparently initiated.

Æµ§œš1, you state or pose as an interrogative; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing """"Ebonics"""" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply sentence, I say, I am saying what I have said and I reiterate it here; """"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective”.   I have said and I reiterate it here; “... As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora. The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics”.   In other words Æµ§œš1, there are ‘proponents of Ebonics’ and are ‘anti-proponents of Ebonics’.  The proponents of Ebonics are those who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   The 'anti-propronents of Ebonics' are those who do not use view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.  The parents of the children of African ancestry in the OUSD for which the OUSD Board passed the resolution in 1996 were parents who are ‘proponents of Ebonics’.  That is, they are parents who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   I have said and and I reiterate here;  “the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) """"Ebonics"""", (2) """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" and/or (3) """"African Language Systems"""".  I say, Wikipedia article that posits the OUSD resolution was about African American Vernacular English is a outright lie.  

You state or pose as an interrogative Æµ§œš1; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing """"Ebonics"""" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply, I say what I have said and I reiterate it here;  the view that Baugh posits as Afrocentric view number (iii) is not Afrocentric at all.  I have said and I reiterate here, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric”.  I have said and I reiterate here, the other three views that Baugh posits as being the view of Afrocentric proponents of Ebonics, i.e., views  (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric.  Given that I did in fact include view number (iv) as an Afrocentric view I am at a loss to understand why you have excluded view number (iv) from what I have said concerning the OUSD resolution.   You should know that I'm suspicious of your having ommited view number (iv).  For view number (iv), i.e., the view that Ebonics “is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English"""" (and thus a rejection of the notion of """"African American Vernacular English"""" but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE, viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect)"""" is what was expressly being supported in the OUSD resolution.    

Now, with regards to your interroagative concerning whether the first paragraph of the OUSD Policy Statement  “could be interpreted as meaning that parents don't have to endorse the controversial classification to accept the services offered”.  My reply is; the OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD who are uncomfortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do not or did not indentify their child’s or childern’s home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that the resolution does not pertain to them.

 Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city 

Dear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2  and Chesdovi) are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag, that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND  at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

You're also being weasely when you suggest that all you want to be able to do is to say that """"x is x,"""" when what you really want to be able to say is that """"y is x.""""  Comprende?  The fact that something is debatable and can be qualified (or rather buried in the part of the article few will ever read) further down does not justify an editorial decision to report that """"y is x,"""" because some other dilettante said so.

Creationism is the explanation  that the universe and all life were created by the deliberate act of God.

In looking through the historical record at the competition between creation and evolution in Darwin's day, I was impressed by Thomas Huxley's 1887 account of how Origin of Species provided the first explanation that in Huxley's view was a better explanation than creation.  Huxley describes the sense in which he rejected creation as an explanation.

If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the explanation explained. 

Huxley describes his similar rejection of the explanations of the evolutionists prior to Darwin.

And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. . . . [A] thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852. . . . Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable. 

Furthermore, any self-respecting religion-neutral anthropologist, such as Robert L. Carneiro, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, would classify creation and evolution as mere successive stages of incomplete but improving explanations in a universe where there is no God to assist the women and men who attempt to discover the truth of their origins. 

From all of the above, I suggest that it is more accurate to define creationism as an explanation rather than a belief.  After all, the survival of the belief derives from the usefulness of the belief, and a primary use of creationism is explaining how we all got here.  According to Thomas Huxley, until Origin of Species, creationism was as good an explanation as evolutionism.  And for the majority of American voters who cannot understand the evolutionists' explanations, creationism is a better explanation than evolutionism even yet today.  - 16:08, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

 Considering that """"Belief in the psychological sense is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude and in the religious sense, belief refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation, generally called faith, and that creationism is part and parcel of the christian faith, I think the use of the term """"belief"""" was completely justified. Creationism is indeed an explanation, but it is an explanation founded on belief, hence it is a belief. It is not founded on knowledge or evidence; to imply otherwise, which is what you're doing, is to create a false impression that Creationism shares some sort of parity with other explanations which do not require belief in the supernatural. It does not. You seem to be substituting your own personal bias for this imputed """"evolutionist bias"""" you claim is on the Creationism page.  16:48, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

 Legal Action 
Wikipedia has a policy. WP:NLT and I agree with it completely. However, they do add the following: 

If you must take legal action, we cannot prevent you from doing so. However, it is required that you do not edit Wikipedia until the legal matter has been resolved to ensure that all legal processes happen via proper legal channels. You should instead contact the person or people involved directly, by email or through any other contact methods the user provides.

That makes a lot of sense. So, please provide me with some contact so that I can contact you directly in order to iron this out. For me, you can contact me at john@johnclarkprose.com. I'll be glad to hear from you, SchroCat. Also Cassianto, MisterShiney, Dr. Blowfeld, Bencherlite and Delicious carbunkle.

The new 'undo' button next to each edit in the 'history' tab of an article, can be used to try and undo that specific edit, it's success is dependent on there not being any conflicting intermediate edits between that particular edit and the current version of the article.

I will neither resort to insults nor put any words in the opponent's mouth like you just did. Instead, I will stick to the point. The matter of fact is, you cited regulations only partially, leaving out the regulation that warns about bias. It says (interpreted) that all authors and all sources are by definition biased, until filtered through neutrality checks and balances. So stop raising references alone to the pedestal of allmightiness. They alone are insufficient to establish that there is no bias (in them and otherwise). They must have an outside check. In historical science the check is called primary historical document and it supersedes all references ever written on history. In this case it is the Ottoman military records, used to create List_of_Ottoman_sieges_and_landings#Growth_.281453.E2.80.931683.29 and Eyalet#Eyalets_in_1609.

Results:
 9 Users opposed the renaming
 17 Users supported the renaming

Discussion:
 Still, this topic is controversial and therefore before changing anything this should be discussed here.
 Please feel free to come up with ideas for a new lemma inculding war  

Including Hezbollah in the name
I would include the name of Hezbollah in the title for four reasons:
1) They instigated the conflict
2) They are one of the primary military force currently engaged
3) This is not a war between two soverign countries as the title suggests
4) While they are part of the Lebanon government, thier military arm has seperate command and control

user:mnw2000 
I agree. It should be Israel-Hizbollah_conflict, Lebanon has little to do with it.  
 I agree, Lebanon army is not a participant, though casualties are mostly Libanese. 'Libanon' in the name is false.  
 Hezbollah is acting independantly of Lebanon, so Hezbollah should be in the name instead of Lebanon.  

I agree as well. Technically, it is not the Israel-Lebanon conflict but the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. Lebanon's troops are not involved. Israel is not targeting Lebonan but Hezbollah. Unfortunately, Hezbollah has established itself in the middle of Lebanon.

No. Use the example of the existing name in 1982 Lebanon War 

How about this compromise The Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon (2006) any thoughts. 

Agree with TheFEARgod. Conflict or TheFEARgod's use of War is Neutral. The examples used to cite use of the term """"war"""" are of concern.  Should Hezbollah sources which refer to fighting as """"Sixth-Arab-Israeli war"""" make it sensible to use that?  Each side aims for certain propaganda/morale advantages when using term """"war"""".  Why are editors so eager to have this article renamed to a war?  I can understand the reasoning behind the arguments but what is the rush?  

I think the rush is legitimate, because readers may think calling it a """"conflict"""" is trying to downplay the event.  It would be like someone writing an article about the """"September Conflict in New York"""" referring to 9/11.  In Lebanon, to the people dying, I'm sure they'd rather it be called a """"massacre"""", so """"conflict"""" would certainly be an understatement.
I don't think the precendent of the 1982 Lebanon War means anything.  It was a different event in a different century and the Lebanese government was much more involved in the war, even agreeing to sign a peace treaty with Israel at one point (see the article).  Besides, I feel the article should reflect the time period in which it's written and it's clear from all the discussion on this page that the """"Israel-Lebanon War"""" would be hotly contested by the community.  20:37, 2 August 2006 (EST)

Hezbollah is bombing Israel, so the conflict isn't only taking place in Lebanon, you'd need to include both places or use a broader term like """"The Middle East""""  

Check the title again: """"Israel-Lebanon conflict."""" It does contain Israel.

Also, this morning, NPR referred to this as """"the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict."""" I'm not sure how other media outlets are referring to it, but if they're also using """"Hezbollah,"""" then that's what we should do. -[[User:",0
"If you're interested in the Administration position with respect to this, here's the excerpt from the DOJ white paper
Even if there were ambiguity about whether FISA, read together with the AUMF, permits the President to authorize the NSA activities, the canon of constitutional avoidance requires reading these statutes in harmony to overcome any restrictions in FISA and Title III, at least as they might otherwise apply to the congressionally authorized armed conflict with al Qaeda. Indeed, were FISA and Title III interpreted to impede the President’s ability to use the traditional tool of electronic surveillance to detect and prevent future attacks by a declared enemy that has already struck at the homeland and is engaged in ongoing operations against the United States, the constitutionality of FISA, as applied to that situation, would be called into very serious doubt. In fact, if this difficult constitutional question had to be addressed, FISA would be unconstitutional as applied to this narrow context. Importantly, the FISA Court of Review itself recognized just three years ago that the President retains constitutional authority to conduct foreign surveillance apart from the FISA framework, and the President is certainly entitled, at a minimum, to rely on that judicial interpretation of the Constitution and FISA.",0

 defaultsort is your friend! 

Hello! I noticed your edit to Mikael Odenberg, so I thought I should drop by and tell you about the wonders of {{DEFAULTSORT}}.

A sortkey is an alternative term the article should be sorted by when listed in a category. For example to add an article called Albert Einstein to the category """"people"""" and have the article sorted by """"Einstein, Albert"""". You would type """"[[Category:People|Einstein, Albert]]"""". This kind of sortkey you successfully added to Mikael Odenberg in your edit.

But, I reverted most of your edit! Why? Because there is a feature called """"Default sort key"""", which changes the default sort key used by categories from the name of the article to the one specified with the magic word {{DEFAULTSORT}}. Instead of adding |Odenberg, Mikael you simply add  {{DEFAULTSORT:Odenberg, Mikael}} above the categories, which I had already done in this case.

 Chemsitry Comments 
I have noticed that you seem to spend a lot of time commenting on chemistry articles, claiming that they need to be either put in context or wikified. I was wondering if you could put in context your own level of knowledge in chemistry, so that the articles can be reeditted to be applicable to your own level of knowledge. With the chemical reaction stubs, I have been assuming that people will generally be looking at them  if they have a basic level of chemical knowledge (i.e. one of about an A-Level student in England) and will not need a full explanation of why the reaction proceeds as it does. If this does not fulfil your ideals what else will I need to add, complete mechanisms with comments of facial and stereo selectivities and such. If so this is simply not possible as there will be a large amount of repeated information on Wikipedia. Please get back to me on this topic. - 

Hello! Eh. Lately I've indeed been editing chemistry articles; BUT only to remove improper categories (such as those you added to, well, a damn lot of articles). Using AutoWikiBrowser. On some, tags such as {{wikify}} have been posted, but not many. I may have edited one or two chemical reaction stubs, but I don't know which ones. Point out more specifically which articles you refer to and I'll see what I can do. Do note, however, that my knowledge of chemistry is extremely basic, and my contributions to chemistry articles have only been clean-up/maintenance work.  (Talk ° contribs) 

Its okay. I'm a qualified chemist, but you seem to be suggesting for example on the Bechamp Reaction that more detail is needed. To me it seems clear.

Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin's response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations. 

Admittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland's herculean efforts to include material about Israel on the Caterpillar.Inc issue. Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under """"Ed O'Loughlin"""" but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself. 

This is perhaps strange considering, and I quote:  Editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument. Wikipedia must include all notable points of view which appear in verifiable published sources. Reporting that activists have said something does not imply that the activists are correct. Removing those reports because you think the activists aren't correct contradicts Wikipedia's core policies. Eleland

"ING Mexico's operations today is largely composed by its acquisition of Seguros Comercial America which was Mexico's largest insurance company, they are now loosing their number one position to currently number five (huge market loss), as the public deoes not trust them with their insurance needs,this Company was also dominant in the property and casualty markets, until a series of irregularities surfaced and became publicly known, now they are still currently loosing their vast portfolio because of ineptly and negligently handling all of their various insurance claims amongst them the huge the Fertinal claim, which was caused by an insured hurricane loss in 2001, this was a total loss as the Insureds Mine in Baja California was totally destroyed and inundated under water by Hurricane Juliette, the initial estimated loss was in the region of US Dollars 84 million, now it is around the region of 184 million, this for Direct Damage only, additionally they have to add Loss of Profits and now Loss of Market which is valued in the billions of US Dollars!

As of the 14th of July 2005 they have been ordered by a mexivcan judge in a court ruling to pay in excess of USD 300 million plus compound interest accrued as of November 2001 to Fertinal (a local prestigiuos mining conglomerate) this because of the repeated refusal to pay a large proceeding claim, which as of May 29th, 2006 has not been paid, of course ING is resorting to all kinds of legal maneuvers in order to avoid paying said incurred claim,additionally the Dutch Management inexcussably and ineptly (and again in a wrong tactical move, wrong as they insult the local Mexican Judiciary by calling them corrupt adding insult to injury) blame it on the supposedly corrupt Mexican Judges instead of blaming it really on their own inept and corrupt local staff once headed by Alfonso Romo (who is currently under criminal investigation by his own shareholders, amongst them and led by his father in law, for alleged money mismanagement in the Savia affair) and his useless and reckless staff! It was about time they honor their due! The quicker they pay their claims the quicker they restitue their social standing and the less the damage will be inflicted upon ING Comercial America in terms of their local image and additionaly in the trust placed upon them by their own Reinsurers who now do doubt their inept handling of both underwriting and claims!!!

Unfortunatelly 6,000 mexicans lost their jobs at Fertinal due to ING Comercial Americas refusal to fully pay the incurred loss! These people out of desperation might enter the US illegally, thus adding more strain to the US job markets! For further information please read: http://www.estaeslaverdad.com/inicio.html

If you seek your insurance claims in Mexico not to be paid in time of need, then this is definitelly the company for you!.",0

Yes it was sourced to a blog, but I think it was reliable.  It has been published on the blog for a year and it is sourced to a court transcript. The pro se litigant was a Yale grad. The blog owner is a 3rd year law student and I don't think he would misquote a federal judge.  Isn't there a way to use that source, with whatever notations?

My statements of views are merely responding to yours.  You write """"I did write that the CA rule creates a double standard, because it does. It says one set of rules governs how the court must act when all parties are represented by counsel, and another set applies to pro se litigants."""".  I don't think that is true. What rule are your referring to?  To the best of my knowledge all the written rules are exactly the same in all courts for both pro ses and attorney except for 1.) ECF, which pro ses are frequently not allowed to use, 2.) pro se forms, which  pro ses aren't required to use.  An attorney could probably use the pro se forms if they wanted. 3.) appellate appendixes  in pro se cases the entire case file is sent over and there is no provision for joint appendixes, a disadvantage for pro ses.  There are also other procedures for pro ses, which are not in the rulessee the appellate procedures which I quoted from the case manuals. As I read the California manual, it seemed merely to instruct the judges to provide more explanation.  I don't remember reading anything that seemed to indicate that a pro se paper would be processed but the same paper from an attorney would be dismissed.

Criminal legislation is supposed to be clear.  A crime is supposed to be a crime no matter who does it unless they are mentally ill or a child.

If someone is jailed for disrupting a court, the Federal Rules require that the court say what the disruption consists of, so there should not be a question of what it was.

Please give me an example of a court order that you think a person can be jailed for not obeying, other than not paying alimony or child support, or not testifying when subpoened about a crime or not responding to a subpoena by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   """,0

 Goodbye everybody 

And what on earth is wrong about this article, specially if settet back where it originally belongs?
I do not accuse people to be socket puppet, I do not insult them with harsh and very illustrativ words, I do not call their articles for garbage or for saying nothing usefull, or for being idiots, nor ignorant, nor do I pretend that they do not contribute with anything on the talk page and never did, nor do I revert other users contributions, as YBM and rjb specially and mainly, as well as some other new users on the page like Maru that night and previous days did, and som other users belonging to the same side of the story.
If I had to be banished for that so had ybm and rjb and maru too and for a much longer period of time and their text to be removed, in fact all of them that night, as they didn't say much else but cynical and fruitless comments on other people works and destructiv critiscism who wasn't justify.
I tried more than 4 times to make them come v´back to ttheir mind and to sopt healding oil to the fire, but it didn't helped. They just had too much fun harrassing users all around the talk page, unpunished.
An objectiv analyse of the page will not only take much time but will most certainly show how true what I state here is.
There is a text that I do not found, an article with the copy/paste of the writting exchange between me and mister Jean Pierre Voyer, where he clearly stated his doing in this affair and his cooperation with YBM in the making of falsification of evidencies, and his arrogancy and proudness in doing so, added some discrepencies in his words and a major amount of respectlessness, and you have the picture of the person behind this all story.
I also received private mails from a mister Rupley, who is (which is) the name of one of YBMs' web site with plenty of litteracy of the kind of Voyer, and with links to Luven, also an ybms' website of the kind. It does not concern the Bogdanovs affair, but concentrate on the theories who corroborate the making of such a fake story and its justifications in doing so.
It's a hobby of some sort, like some like Shakespeare or a special branch of philosophy or politic or a sub for us mostly unknown special branch of a political - philosofical - opinionated - with social ramification kind of organisation, touching a very small group of individuals inclosed in their believes. 
There is plenty of the like all over the world, their reason for adding to those ideas are those people life and choices, which I do respect, but in that case, those idiosyncrasies (thats my own choice of denomination and not theirs)are being punched ininto the reality of a lot of people and involved real ideas.
I think of course about the balancing act of inplanting those high flying ideas to the reality of the thousands of internet users by imposing their vues inthis Bogdanov affair. By vues I do not mean the apparent version of the fact given by YBM about the validity of the actual thesis. No. It isn't what it is about. It is more complex than that. It is about playing with people reactions in a situation of confrontations and playing with lies. Creating stories, ideas, like gossips who have no bund in the rality but who will nonetheless create a reaction in the people who are witnessing it at the time, and build on further from those reactions, and add more and more stuff to keep the tension and the artificial affair going on.
It might not be as complicated as it sounds to bring those ideas to live, as it very quickly get a dynamic of its own who keep repeating itself, if some element are implemented along the way.
It has roll this way for 2 years now, and the scenario are pretty much the same from a Forum to another.
One can see the same scenarios coming up, the same elements who keep coming back, the same strange behaviours at odd time, and the same surprising reactions when prooven wrong: a war take place, fill with denials, wild accusations, insults, personnal attacks, anything goes type of scenarios, with a lot of drama and tension in it, and many people getting injured, and leaving too. 
mostly those who came with the unbeatable arguments as I saw it so many times on fr. physic, from june to november 2004.
Looking at it after without having a part of it, give the priviledged view of the whole thing in a very short period of time , in one view, and here all those flaws are very obvious and it seems estonishing that nobody noticed it at the time. The game is very clear that way, and it was clear for me that there was something wrong going on, something who wasn't right, a mismatch. 
And i seek after what it could be.
It was evident that the main person involved didn't have clean floor in his bag, and that he was hidding something but also that he was clearly lying and very """"good"""" at it, very good",0

 suggestions for corrections 

Hi,
I'm not a native english speaker, so I hesitate to edit some mistakes myself:

Whether the sarcophagus was ever intended to house a body is unknown. It is too short to accommodate a medium height individual without the bending of the knees, a technique not practiced in Egyptian burial, and no lid was ever found.

I never heard about the sarcophagus being too short, this is certainly not generally accepted knowledge.
Also, there are many other presumed items missing, such as the portcullis blocks (alleged remnants are left), some kind of slide connecting gallery and ascending passage, entrance blocks and the entire floor of the queens chamber. Keep in mind that the pyramid was open for centuries with no guards whatsoever-only immovable or almost immovable structures remained until the first attempts to a professional description of the interior more than 3000 years after construction.

Egyptologists suggest the chamber was intended to be the original burial chamber, but that King Khufu later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid.

The 'change in plans'-theory has been suggested by some, but AFAIK is rejected by contemporary egyptologists such as Lehner and Stadelmann. Instead, they suggest an intended unfinishedness for religious purposes.

The Greeks believed that slave labour was used but modern Egyptologists accept that it was built by many tens of thousands of skilled workers.

Not """"the Greeks"""", but Herodot writes about slaves, a myth which seem to be ineradicable. He visited the pyramids 2000 years after the construction and beside naming the builders correctly, had not much of a clue about anything else.

The Great Pyramid is the only pyramid known to contain both ascending and descending passages.

I'd say the satellite pyramid of the bent pyramid counts, too. It has a remarkable similarity to the great gallery as well. Minor point, I know.

The National Geographic Society filmed the drilling of a small hole in the southern door, only to find another larger door behind it.

I know Hawass said that during the show, but no other egyptologist believes that. Look at the images yourself. There have been no further attempts made to """"open"""" the alleged door. I'd say, don't call it a second door until proven otherwise. The shafts seem to end in this tiny room-a very similar structure can be found in the southern upper shafts as well, by the way.

Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself """"is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom""""

I wonder where Mr. Tyldesley got that information from. I am not aware of any ancient source regarding the opening of the pyramid. While I believe it has happened, and during the first intermediate period, there is nothing but vague hints in old egyptian sources-I think the term """"known"""" is exaggerated. Herodot and Diodor claim to have been inside-that points to the pyramid being open around 450 bc, but at which point the opening happened remains uncertain. 

Hope this is helpful!

Random Question
Hi.  I am a rather biology noob, hopefully this question doesn't sound strange.  I am curious as to whether it is possible for stem cell creation to one day reach a peak where we can replace animal Slaughterhouse?  Forget about the economic factor for a minute.  Is it theoretically possible to feed a nation with meat that was grown 100% in a lab and not killed from any animal??  I had a thought that animals would benefit greatly from this.   
Um, you could grow either stem cells or non-stem cells in some sort of cell culture system for food, I guess, but it seems like a hideously expensive exercise & you would likely use animal or animal-derived products in their growth. The problem would still be the texture and the flavour''.
Realistically, it would be easier to feed everyone with soya flavoured to taste like meat. I've read that the entire underdeveloped world could be easily fed using the grain the US alone feeds its livestock (not sure if that's true though). Eating meat is costsly, and in vitro meat would be even moreso. The best way to save the animals would be to go vegetarian... but I still like a good steak.  
So you are saying there is never going to be an answer since taste and flavor can never be produced in a lab?  
Not never, just that I suspect that taste and flavour will be greater hurdles than growing cells. I don't see why it has to be stem cells that are grown as """"meat"""" - actually you would be better off growing muscle cells, as it is the muscle (and some fat) that is what is in a typical steak.  

In this line:  """"In the future, medical researchers anticipate being able to use technologies derived from stem cell research to treat a wider variety of diseases including cancer, parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, and muscle damage, amongst a number of other impairments and conditions.""""

 Answer from Falun Gong talk page 

Katsam, Im a Falun Gong practitioner, if youd like to listen to what i have to say, i can answer your questions briefly from our point of view. Many people see Falun Gong in different ways, some criticize it and some other people practice it, youll hear many things from many people but in the end its up to you to make up your mind about it. Falun Gong or Falun Dafa is a cultivation system of mind and body, there are the 5 sets of excercises to practice and there are the books for reading which contain the teachings of Mr. Li. 
The purpose of our practice is to assimilate to the principles of """"Truth Benevolence Forbearance"""" and letting go of attatchments, all this is substantiated by the practice of the excercises which provides you with gong, gradually cleans your body and evolves many things for you. A religion can be a cultivation system but not necessarily a cultivation system has to be a religion, so Falun Gong is in no way a religion of some sort, we dont pray or worship any gods at all and there are no """"churches"""" or enrollment sistems, people practice voluntarily and you can start or stop whenever you want. 

You can practice wherever and whenever you want and as long as you want, There are practice sites where you can go if youd like to share your practice and time with other practitioners too. There are no ranks in falun gong, there is an assistant who teaches the excercises to new people and coordinates the group practice. Mr. Li is often reffered to as the """"master"""" by the students because of respect but he never asked to be called this way.

According to our point of view, to be practitioner is to be a person who wants to be better everyday and who wants to improve himself in all the aspects of his life but as you may have noticed, not everyone is perfect and we can all make mistakes during the process of cultivation, everyone has their own attatchments and personal problems that they have to overcome but with patience i think anything can be achieved, so this is why some people feel compelled to practice it more than other types of Qigong.

About the persecution, our point of view on the matter is that there came to be so many falun gong practitioners in China that the government decided to """"supress"""" them in order to prevent that the Chinese people would start following principles different from the Chinese Comunist ideology. Supression or persecution, however its called, something is happening. Some other people may deny it, the government might say there is nothing going on but we believe its very clear that there is something going on. You can identify the practitioners at the practice sites while they do the excercises or you can just ask, true FG practitioners dont lie, if they dont want to say something, perhaps they wont say it, but whatever they say must be true, thats the way it should be. But i wonder now, how can you supress this practice by just telling people not to do it? we think there is something beyond that, which is torture. If you want to legally forbid something, you have to have a reason for it, so if you dont have it, you come up with it.

Everything i just said is the FG practitioners point of view on the matter and in no way it represents the opinion of everyone present on this talk page, perhaps later on you might listen to the critics point of view, again all i can say is that its up to you to make up your mind about it. If youd like to see some pictures or know more about the practice from the practitioners point of view, you can go to this webpage www.falundafa.com  """,0

 In the edit summary of your second edit of this article, you incorrectly state that """"Clearly there is some dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article. This tag should not be removed until this dispute is resolved."""" What there was was this group of I.P. addresses engaged in vandalism and other disruptive behavior, with one person (69.230.175.35, with possibly this same person using one or more of the other I.P. addresses) ending the """"dispute"""" with an act of vandalism in addition to the message """"You know what fuck off [some Anglo-Saxon name].

 So in fact there had been no authentic """"dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article"""". The """"Omega Point (Tipler)"""" article is accurate in describing the Omega Point Theory, with thorough citations provided. The article follows Wikipedia policy of WP:NPOV, as the article does not claim that the Omega Point Theory is true, but instead is written in the neutral point of view: it describes the Omega Point Theory, but it does not claim that it is correct. The article uses neutral-point-of-view language, such as """"According to Tipler from a 2005 paper in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics, he outlines the following reasons why he maintains ...""""

 In the edit summary of your first edit of this article, you state """"Obvious really, who the hell is repeatedly removing this categorisation?"""", referring to the """"Category:Pseudoscience"""" edit added by said person or persons engaged in vandalism, nonsense edits and disruptive edits. Your edit summary falsely makes it seem as if this edit has long been in the article, and that it has just recently been removed, which is incorrect. Your edit here also violates Wikipedia policy, such as WP:Truth and WP:NPOV. Prof. Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world's leading physics journals, and so under WP:Reliable Sources does not qualify as """"pseudoscience"""". Your phraseology of """"who the hell"""" also violates WP:Civility.

 You claim WP:Undue Weight for the latest factually-incorrect edits, yet almost the entirety of the peer-reviewed paers in science journals are in support of the Omega Point Theory. There has only been one refereed paper in a physics journal that was critical of Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory, but the authors of that paper unwittingly gave an argument that unless the Omega Point comes about then the laws of physics are violated, and so thereby actually gave a powerful argument for the Omega Point Theory's correctness. Tipler cites this article in support of his Omega Point Theory in his 2005 Reports on Progress in Physics article.

 Regarding critical reviews of Tipler's books, none of them have been refereed in science journals. They are book reviews that have not undergone the referee process that is required of actual papers.

 Prof. Tipler and his Omega Point Theory have been in the news recently. This has drawn the attention of ideologically-motivated people who upon hearing of it take an extreme visceral dislike to it. Because of this, this article and its associated talk page have recently been subject to vandalism and other disruptive behavior.

 Therefore, due to the foregoing reasons, you are here requested not to further engage in such factually-incorrect and Wikipedia-policy-violating edits.

 I will start a """"Criticisms"""" section which details the above information, but do not add factually-incorrect and Wikipedia-policy-violating tags to this article.

 Some Issues (which I'm about to attempt to partially fix) 

1. The gold-leaf and quadrant electrometers are in a sense, also repulsion electrometers; they both work by measuring the repulsion of the same charge in one way or another.

2. My 1861 chem textbook uses the name """"quadrant electrometer"""" to describe a considerably simpler device than Kelvin invented. This device has an index which goes between 0 and 90 degrees (hence a quadrant) while Kelvin's device, while I don't fully understand it, had a drum split into quadrants. So I conclude that this is a coincidence. 

The best solution I can think of is to create a section of repulsion electrometers, and then describe the types individually in their own sections underneath, e.g. gold-leaf, Dellmann, Peltier, Bohnenberger. I will rename """"quadrant electrometer"""" to """"Kelvin's quadrant electrometer"""", and then put both his and the simpler one under """"repulsion electrometers"""".

Hopefully we can make this article clearer and neater.

To say that """"Britain headed the Commonwealth"""" is simply wrong and it represents a misunderstand of what the Commonwealth was and is. onec again: Britain and the Dominions (or later Commonwealth realms) were considered to be equals in the Commonwealth (whereas British India, in 1939, and the crown colonies were not). Hence the Dominions declared war independently of Britain in 1939 (and the Irish Free State, which was a Dominion at the time, remained neutral). Britain is not even a """"first among equals"""". That is the difference between the Commonwealth of Nations and the British Empire. In fact, for most of the war, the vast majority of Australian forces served under Douglas MacArthur in the South West Pacific Area, rather than under British commanders anywhere else. 

Similarly it is a misrepresentation to say that the United States """"ran"""" the Kuomintang. In fact, the Americans — whose forces were technically under Chiang Kai Shek when they served in China — found it very hard to get Chiang to fight the Japanese as much as they would have liked, since he was more concerned with stockpiling weapons and materiel to fight the communists.

In short, I think the division into the Big 3 and subordinate allies is historically incorrect.

By the way, many of the so-called """"London exiles"""" actually had their headquarters and major bases in the US or Canada (e.g. The Netherlands). (Talk) 11:48, May 17,""",0

"Amirite Article 

Hi Greg Jack,

I saw what you put in the Amirite Article Debate

Only some of the articles I have quoted are Press releases. This one for example is certainly not a paid release: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/share-opinions-online-amiritenet-amirite/ Makeuseof is a very well known site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MakeUseOf

I don't think the killerstartups article is a paid release since it doesn't mention adversarial on it. Also Amirite's twitter has over 62,000 followers which is significant: https://twitter.com/amiritecom And if you type Amirite.com and Amirite.net into google this brings more than 5 million results. This is significant.

Is there any chance you might re-consider your vote since this is my first article and it would be a shame to have it deleted, especially sinc I really hope it isn't since I'm a big fan of Amirite,

You suggested the information I deleted were 'important'.

 classical optics part 2 

i hate to say this but i think everyone has completely misunderstood what i am tryint to do.

i am just trying to give a clear picture to the reader of the beginings and then move on to the other sections, i have no intention at all of changing the structure of the article. the article begins very clearly with the """"classical optics"""" part that describes how light was considered before the wave model. the problem our current presentation is that the wave model is right in the begining, this is a bit strange.

that is why i arranged the article such that you had the classical optics and its further explanation in geometrical optics, then wave modeln then comparison to quantum optics and finally modern optics. in other words nothing in the article changed except for the position.
copper i feel that in the sources you have shown they are considering classical optics as the entire thing which is both the particle and wave model. however what i am doing is showing the beginning of optics. there are other google hits that take classical optics purely as the earlier concepts before the introduction of wave model but anyway there is no point of going through them and listing them. one google book on fourier optics does not mention the word """"electromagnetism"""" till page 365! different terminology i guess. anyway 

i feel that we cant put the wave model in the beginning, it just would not make any sense. its like we are skipping everything and landing on maxwells equations which happened much later. the current form is ok. 

it follows a good pattern - classical, geometrical, wave model, comparison with quantum optics finally modern optics.""",0

I suspect, that the admin in question has not even bothered to read the page - they certainly didn't notice an admin around or the the page was being monitored as part of informal arbitration, or that LB is my second login!

Perhaps we should work on that section here.  Here's the text, which I've started making an effort to clean up... although it needs a lot more work.
Oh, and the page should probably be all Harvard refs, rather than none:  Wikipedia usually sticks with the style chosen by the first author.    

Instrumental rudeness and pragmatic competence
Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviors to achieve a goal.  Early works in linguistic pragmatism interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.  

Prior to the mid-1990s, most linguistics research ignored the instrumental or 'useful' nature of rudeness in speech (Brown & Levinson, 1987; Grice, 1975; Lakoff, 1973).  Before then, rudeness was seen as a sign of communication failure:  Lakoff gave """"two rules"""" of pragmatic competence (1973): be clear, and be polite. Grice (1975) believed that rudeness violated universal norms of conversation of truthfulness, politeness and relevancy.  Likewise,  Brown and Levinson's politeness framework (1987  pp. 60-61) is also based on the idea that politeness is normative and rudeness is eschewed even when engaging in 'face-threatening acts' (FTAs) such as making a complaints or refusing a request.  """"The semantics and pragmatics of utterances must be taken into account in assessing degree of face redress; if the overt content of an utterance is rude, for example, politeness strategies won’t necessarily redeem it."""" (Brown & Levinson, 1987, p. 22)

Robin Lakoff (1989) addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  

Gabriele Kasper (1990) gives us the earliest definition of rudeness in an academic paper.   In her discussion of Lakoff's (1989) research on strategic rudeness, Kasper (1990) defines rudeness as speech that is """"constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium"""" (Kasper, 1990, p. 208).  This definition is important, in that it marks rudeness as speech which is confrontational at its core.  Although Kasper (1990) further defines rudeness as 'motivated' and 'unmotivated,' her definitions do not make use of natural data.  

It is not until Leslie Beebe's research comes along in the early to mid-1990s that data on naturally occurring instances of rudeness in everyday conversation is collected.  Drawing from Lakoff's (1989) idea of strategic rudeness, Beebe (1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1995) similarly proposes the concept of instrumental rudeness; rudeness that is meant to achieve a goal.  Like Lakoff (1989) and Kasper (1990), Beebe (1995) believes that rudeness is confrontational behaviour, and indeed in her research, she found that """"hostility seemed to pervade the data"""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 156).   In her study of naturally occurring rudeness in New York City, Beebe (1995) provides her own definition of rudeness:

""""In this study, rudeness is defined as a face threatening act (FTA)- or feature of an FTA such as intonation- which violates a socially sanctioned norm of interaction for the social context in which it occurs.  It is only rudeness if it receives insufficient redressive action to mitigate its force or, of course, if it does not occur in a context, such as intimacy or emergency, that would negate the need for redressive action.  Consequently, it causes antagonism, discomfort, or conflict and results in some disruption to the social harmony.   The idea that socially sanctioned norms of interaction are violated is central to the perception of rudeness."""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 159)

In this definition, Beebe (1995) asserts that rudeness is an FTA, or a feature of an FTA, that has not been mitigated by redressive action and does not occur between intimates or in emergency situations.  Essentially, rudeness is a bald, on-record face attack, and not a failed attempt at politeness.  This definition would also most likely preclude culturally-specific ritual insults, verbal games, or manners of speech that are used among members of certain social groups.   Labov (1972) argues that ritual insults, or 'sounding,' follow certain linguistic, organizational, and interactional rules.   If such speech among members of a cultural in-group could be seen as following 'socially sanctioned norms of interaction' (as Labov, 1972, argues) where there is a low risk of face-loss, it would most likely not be considered 'rude speech,' according to Beebe's (1995) definition of rudeness.

Whenever anyone states a clearly obvious uncontested fact in Wiki, which is what about 50% of Wiki is, unless someone can show the logical fallacy of the statement being presented as fact, it is usually not removed due to lack of documentation.  For example, if I write that the Dravidian culture of India is centered towards the Southern end of India, I generally won't document it, as it is already a well known fact amongst those who know about India.  Now if I were wrong about this in an article, then perhaps someone would first point out specifically that they have heard that the Dravidian culture is centered in the North of India, and could I please document my claim that it is centered in the South.  But simply to remove without even saying why, that doesn't seem to me to comply with general Wiki practice.

We've already discussed the Big Chin to death.  It was one of many allegations of photo manipulation dismissed by the HSCA. You want to mention it as if 1) it was never debunked 2) it's the most important thing ever 3) it is proof of conspiracy.    

Gamaliel, none of the three things you just wrote make any logical sense. 1)Some believe the chin is not a fabrication. So what? This doesn't mean these true believers have """"debunked"""" something. Its their opinion. The policy of this web site is to provide all opinions, and certainly not to hide the evidence. When are you going to understand this rule? 2) How important is it? It is relevant to Oswald's contention that some one was framing him. Whether that is the """"most important thing ever' is up to the reader. 3) Whether it is proof of a conspiracy is also up to the reader. 

Gamaliel, your frantic attempts to delete and hide any information that you disagree with is directly contrary to the web site rules. Why do you continue to do it?
 

Don't forget, there were two Oswald's. Lee Oswald and Harvey Oswald. One worked for the CIA and was the real triggerman, I forget which... But wait a minute, the fatal shot really came from the grassy knoll, from an anti-Castro Cuban, who wanted payback, for no air-support for Brigade 2506, during the Bay of Pigs disaster... No wait a minute Oswald was a paid hitman for the mafia...... oh well It's 3:37 in the AM, all this conspiracy stuff is making me loopy. Goodnight.
 

Gamaliel, is this person above who calls himself """"Mytwocents"""" your alter ego, and put in for comic relief?

This article is not neutral

Surely it's not the job of Wikipedia contributors to decide whether or not Oswald worked alone, was part of a conspiracy or had anything to do with the assassination at all.  It seems to me that the only way of rendering a neutral article is to state that Oswald was arrested and held on suspicion of Kennedy's murder, but was killed before he could be tried.  It can then be provably stated that the Warren Commission, in its Report, concluded that Oswald was guilty and had worked alone, but that there have since been many efforts and arguments that attempt to disprove this conclusion.

"""

 The """"Ethiopian birr model"""" 

You suggested to use this model in some cases. In my opinion, it is okay to include a territory in the current part succession box that has some autonomous rights (especially the right to have its own currency, like pre-2006 Montenegro or present-day Kosovo). Therefore, in the case of Ethiopian birr, it makes sense to speak about currency of Eritrea between 1952-1960 and between 1993-1997. between 1960-1993, only Ethiopian administration existed, Eritrea had neither sovereignty nor any sort of autonomous rights. (Saying in 1978 that the currency of Eritrea is the birr is like saying in 2006 that the currency of East Germany is the euro.) The same case of Austria between 1938-1945. Even Ukraine and Belarus represents the same situation during their Soviet Union """"membership"""", however, both countries had more or less autonomy and were members of the UN since 1945. 

I have the fear that the innumerable border modifications in Europe during the XXth century will make huge and complicated succession boxes. For example, after WWII, Slovakia got back not only its Southern territories (Which the 1st Vienna Award awarded to Hungary in 1938), but three villages near to Pozsony / Bratislava (Horvátjárfalu / Jarovce, Oroszvár / Rusovce, Dunacsúny / Cunovo) were awarded to Slovakia (Treaty of Paris) due to strategic considerations. One could say that who cares with three villages, but this territory was part of Hungary between the two world wars - and it is not much smaller than Muraköz (Medimurje)...

So I don't think each territorial change must be mentioned in the succession box. Only mention if the currency of a new country / state / autonomous province etc. (so a state-like subject that has the right to circulate its own currency) appears without precedessor (like Eritrean nakfa after split from Ethiopia in 1993, but unlike Ethiopian birr after split of Eritrea) or disappears without successor (like East German mark after the reunificaton of Germany in 1990, but unlike West-German mark after the reunification).

For example, German mark or deutschmark was the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany between 1948-2001. It would express that East Germany was simply integrated into West-Germany (contrary to the widely used """"reunification"""" term), at least from the point of view of the circulating currency. It would also express that Germany is not the successor state of West Germany but the same country with an enlarged territory. 

In the case of the pengő, I would simply say that it was the currency of Hungary between 1 Jan 1927 and 31 Jul 1946. Northern Transylvania, Southern Slovakia and Bácska was totally incorporated into the Hungarian administration. Subcarpathia enjoyed some autonomy, but it was very little and cannot be compared to the rights of then-Yugoslav federal states, present day US states or German federal states.

Naturally, this is only my opinion, I would like to know your thoughts.  """,0

Jareth: (see above) Ms. Barber has repeatedly and continuously made personal attacks about other registries and should be banned by you for doing so.  She should be subject to the same rules/restrictions to which the other contributors to this discussion have been held.

And, despite being the """"first"""" registry, what independent, unbiased documentation has the ISSR provided to show that they are any """"different"""" or more """"recognized"""" than any other Shiloh registry, when it comes to accreditation by any outside organization. The fact of the matter is, the ISSR is no more """"recognized"""" independently than any of the other Shiloh registries currently in operation.

Also, like the 'self' proclaimed registries Ms. Barber references, the ISSR also issues its own """"pieces of paper"""" based on Ms. Barber's own determination and her registry charge for these """"pieces of paper"""".  What Ms. Barber is claiming about other registries (""""Just because someone says something [and it's not illegal] that does not *make* it so!!""""), is true of her own, as she has repeatedly throughout this discussion failed to provide unbiased, independent (as you stipulated as a rule for the inclusion of information or contribution) corroboration that her organization is any different.

These links are not unbiased, factual, neutral information.  Readers wishing to pursue more information re: her club/registry have the link at the bottom of the article (along with the other registry/club links) they can access if they want to hear more from her.

At this stage, I think it is obvious that Ms. Barber has no intention of negotiating and compromising, in good faith and mutual respect, a """"neutral"""", factual, independent, unbiased article.

Hey Jim, I again want to thank you for your important help. I believe that together we will place the article Raz Nadav on Wikipedia. This writer and his readers deserves it.

1.I was rewriting the article Raz Nadav. Please take a look at it.

2.Stanford University Library and the Ohio University library, bought the two books of Raz Nadav. These major universities buy only valuable books for their libraries, therefore Raz Nadav is a valuable writer.

3.In the new links I Attached you can see the name of the books in Hebrew (but in English letters). the first book name: """"ha-Lev ha-ro`eh"""" (Translated: """"Seeing heart"""" or """"The seeing heart""""). The second book name: """"ha-Blondiniyot  ha `atsuvot shel hayai"""" (Translated: """"The sad blonds of my life"""").

4.In this link of Stanford University library you can see the name of the book In English on the right at the bottom of the page.

7. A new version of the article Raz Nadav:
Raz Nadav (born January 7, 1976) is an Israeli Writer.

Raz Nadav was born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel. Inspired by the peace activist Abie Nathan, he started writing short stories in his boyhood and also joined and supported Nathan's activities as a member of the humanitarian organization Abie's Angels.
In his early 20's Nadav moved to the USA. He first lived in New York and then in Seattle. Few years later Nadav returned to Israel and started writing his books.
Between 2003 and 2006   Nadav has published two Hebrew books: The first titled """"ha-Lev Ha –ro`eh"""" (The seeing heart). It is a collection of short stories, some of which written in the magic realism genre touching on science fiction in its content.
The second book is """"ha-blondiniyot  ha `atsuvot shel hayai"""" (The sad blondes of my life). The novel follows a wild and reckless radio DJ involved in delusional and destructive relationships with three depressed blondes.

In Turkey, according to a survey in early October 2009, 53 percent of the population would object to having a Jewish neighbor. He has been accused of exploiting such prejudice for political gains: On October 8, 2009, he stated in a speech at the Yildiz Technical University of Istanbul that he has been watching """"the Jewish model of success"""", pointing to """"their [the Jews'] buisness instinct"""", and claiming that """"Jews are able to make their money multilply while seated.""""En Turquie, le premier ministre, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, exploite un sentiment d'hostilité vis-à-vis d'Israël (Le Monde, October 19, 2009)

I'm struggling to see what the current dispute is about after my enforced spell in the slammer.  Karbinski argues for """"Philosophy is the science that studies the fundamental aspects of the nature of existence in order to provide man with a comprehensive view of life.

I prefer a return to the main four branches.  Deleting the 'reasoned argument' part is not supported by the sources, of which there are plenty.  Philosophy would be a science in the original meaning of 'science' (scientia) but the modern meaning, while not entirely different, has connotations that it would be best to avoid.  On whether the philosophy of language belongs in the main branches, that is debateable.  My view, given the dominance of the 'Old Logic' (the Categories and On Interpretation) and of the importance of those two to the Metaphysics, I would say it does belong.    """,0

 List of New Jersey Devils players 

I have created a List of New Jersey Devils players to compliment the one in categories. When making player additions to the New Jersey Devils article, could you also add the player to the list of Devils players? Thanks! Masterhatch 5 August 2005
Is this a complete list that will be updated periodically? Do we have a master database for this information anywhere?  (T | C) 

Devils Captain soon?
Say RGTraynor and/or Masterhatch, do you know if the Devils plan to name Patrik Elias captain, when he returns to the lineup? Or is the captaincy to remain vacant for the 2005-06 season?

 No knowledge, although possibly the Devils' website has an archived press release to that effect.  In any event it's speculative, and there's no need to post anything until and unless the Devils make any formal announcement of a new captain.   

 I've added Scott Niedermayer to the Devils """"Captain list"""", as he's on the captains list, in the Offical New Jersey Devils website.  
Because we really need more reminders of how we got shafted this season?? ;)  (T | C) 

Wow, the is team most of the most amount of American players in the NHL!  

Scouts and Rockies
Why are you expanding content knowing that such content has articles to themselves???  
Because I plan on expanding the Scouts & Rockies articles beyond what they say, and the history of the organizations should be mentioned in the article on the current version of the franchise.  I'm thinking ahead to when this is further expanded, since I plan on improving this article to Featured article status. Besides, they're still only paragraphs compared to the main article as a whole.   Hit me up... 

Maybe others disagree, but I think this article should only explain the circumstances of the Rockies relocation to NJ. Its also borderline plagiarism of the source you cited. It is obvious you took thier copy and merely editted it to your liking.  

 Current practice on the NHL Team Pages is to write up the history of previous incarnations of the same franchises on their particular pages, and have a very brief summary at best on the current page.  Expanding the KC/Colorado pages makes perfect sense; duplicating the same text on the NJ page is redundant and liable to be reverted.   

Relevant to this discussion:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/History of the New Jersey Devils

Why?  It is fairly unimportant information.  It is quite common for relatives to be in the same sport.  See Notable families in the NHL for a number of examples of relatives that have actually made it to the NHL.  I will remove the information.    
Agreed.  Until Steve does something notable, he doesn't belong in the article.  

Team Logo
Can we come to a consensus on whether or not the logo should be used in the season-by-season record table? I don't know if it is legitimate fair use as I'm not a lawyer. I would rather see the logos removed from that table because they are pointless and repetitive. In an article called """"New Jersey Devils"""", can't we assume that someone looking at that table would know its referring to the New Jersey Devils? Is the fact that the logo once had green in it somehow relevant to their record on the ice?  (talk)

 Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city 

Dear Salvio and other administrators:

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2  and Chesdovi) are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag, that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND  at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

Hi.

When you update the stats in football players' infoboxes please remember that you should also update the timestamps as of when the stats are correct.

 That sounds almost like the Tibetan government-in-exile's claim that """"violence to a Tibetan is killing someone; if you don't kill them, and only beat them up, and they run away, it's not violence"""" (I'm paraphrasing, but the exact quote is in 2008 Tibetan unrest.)  but you'd probably resent that comparison.

Let's start over...

This is not going anywhere, except towards mediation. Though I agree more or less completely with Justin's edits, you both need to calm down. The spelling/language issue is pointless, as are the insults, as are the reverts, and the misleading and/or rude edit summaries. Who cares which version is online for two or three hours, if it's going to be reverted anyway once this debate is completed? So let's focus on the debate, and leave the page at some point where we are all familiar with the content, and then do changes step-by-step. To improve the mood here, I think Daryou should accept that there may be some spelling errors in his texts, while Koavf really needs to respect that Daryou's not a native speaker, and not harass him over this. (And I need to stop sounding like my mom.)
 Mincom, the Moroccan government's own site, is of course propaganda, by every definition of the word, but that doesn't mean it can't be used as a source - for what Morocco's government thinks and says. On the other hand, pasting hole chunks of text from it as fact, is obviously not how this should be done.
 Inserting that Western Sahara was """"peacefully ... liberated"""" by Morocco is also betraying an agenda that is far more biased than your edits have been so far, Daryou. I think you've been trying to make that point all along, consistently in all of your edits, but you used to be better at hiding it.
 Questions remain above to be answered, with arguments, not reverts or insults.
 That's my input for today, and, yes, I think mediation could be a good thing. I was hoping we could settle this one through discussion (it has worked before!), but I've lost hope by now.

"Lion vs Tiger: Consenses Request 

Hello Keith, I was wondering if you could help fix the lion vs tiger topic, it seems the topic has a certain someone with abusuing wikipedias ethics and using it to pump out some type of bias supremacy, cherry picking and being subjective, even contradicting his own guidelines he uses, makes false accusations and is hypocritical to his own suggestions.

I'd like to start it off with suggesting to review the revision of its current and compare it to a previous one:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tiger_versus_lion&diff;=prev&oldid;=591817160

Changes were made simply because some of the data was unreliable as stated in the talk:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tiger_versus_lion

I have learned that I must only make comments on the edits, and not the editors, so I will try and keep it as so to better adress it. My main delima is, this topic has been unchecked for years, and has no true consensus that is confirmed reliable and un-bias, so I would like to request if you could share the info with a few others to develop a basic un-bias assesment, I'd like to start it off with pointing out a guide line:

Under its:

History

The qualifications: Should be of historical signifcance, so only people with back grounds of Ph.d and Masters degrees should be accepted for reliability and credability via Historians.

Physical comparison

The qualifications: Should be adressed on a species scale, the historical significance is graded on its history, so it must refraim from cherry picking sub-speices via bengal and siberian, but then leave out the malay, sumatran, bali ect and include all of them to reach an average.

Accidental fights in captivity

The qualifications: All historical/modern accounts should be fully brought to the awareness of the world/public, the details should be mentioned for both sides regardless if its a un-fair fight of gender, age, and quanity/odds, all documentation should be accepted according to reliablility, as of now there is only pro-tiger data that is in effect as pure insinuation, via cherry picked while other reliable sources that supports the lion is being constantly erased with no viable reasons other than false accusations and making things up.

Expert opinions

The qualifications: Should be upon people with observation upon seeing them fight, an opinion from someone with experince working with these animals is not enough and holds no merits since the topic is specifically on fighting, if they haven't seen them fight (has no cites mentioning a observed fight) it shoulden't be used, only people who have been eye witnesses to conflicts between the two should be used for credability.

I am suggesting a more fair assesment since what is in place now is subjective, bias and pro-data, both sides of the coin should be mentioned, all the substance should be mentioned both ways, and a fair assesment on what is avaliable to add in should be implimented both ways of its reliability and credability.

Thank you for your time",0

As you are ignorant of even the most rudimentary conventions of honorable duelling it is my duty to inform you that it is the challenger, not the challenged who determines distance, as stated in rule #16 of the Codo Duello. You must also elaborate on the pistols to be used, otherwise I will assume any caliber semi-automatic is permissable. As you have chosen the grounds, you are also responsible for providing the boat on which the pistol duel will take place. If you are unable to find a boat with a large enough deck to accomodate an honorable duel (at least twenty paces of unobstructed space in a corridor ten feet wide) another option is that two smaller boats may be used, in calm seas. Inflatable rafts and non-motorized dingheys are not acceptable. I must commend you on selecting a cowardly weapon which greatly complicates the relatively straightforward process of an at-seas duel, you perfidious poltroon. Should you miraculously acquire vertabrae between now and the chosen date, I will gladly agree to a change in weapons, especially to epees. The time is acceptable to me. Please note that duels cannot take place within the jurisdiction of Canada, and therefore must take place at least 200 nautical miles (not standard miles) from the continental margin, to avoid breaking laws which expressly forbid dueling. 

I await the duel eagerly. Please offer my advance condolences to your family members.

"The fact that the students in Waldorf schools in California have personal exemptions from immunizations at a higher rate than the state average is fact, verified by the State of California statistics which I ref'd.

Moving to the rest of the state provides similar numbers.

"Could you please explain... 

Could you please explain why you redirected Military Commission to Military Justice?

Were you unaware that one of the huge controversies over the USA's use of military commissions to try the Guantanamo captives was that they were a new distinct system, separate from its traditional military justice system?  The Military Commission system had no established rules of evidence, no established precedents.  This is why rather than being the speedy system that was promised, these cases have dragged on for almost a decade.  

Legal critics predicted these problems back when Bush tried to create the new Military Commission system.  They pointed out that the USA already had two perfectly adequate justice systems, its civilian justice system and its military justice system.  The military commission system, they pointed out, was a brand new, third justice system.

One of David Hicks's lawyers described, with disgust, why he wasn't available to give Hicks his advice, when Hicks's was presented with a plea bargain deal on the eve of his commission.  Hicks's lawyer who had flown all the way to Guantanamo, from Australia, described being told he could not participate any further in Hicks's defense, unless he signed a draconian document that would have imposed heavy punishment upon him, if he broke any of the commission's rules and procedures.  Fine, he says, please let me read those rules.  He then described his shock and outrage when he was told that he couldn't be given a copy of the commission's rules and procedures because they hadn't been written yet.

Frankly I think this redirection was a bad idea, very misleading.",0

Yeah, it's pretty fascinating. I disagree that New Englanders moved into New York City and changed the accent to non-rhotic. Lots of people moved into New York City...Jews, Italians, and Irish being the biggest. I think New Englanders might be around # 178 on the list of groups moving to NYC, and the New Engand -ar is so different from the NYC -ar that we can forget the whole theory. Also the Northern Cities accent shift is food for a nice academic paper (that's what scholars do, right?) but incorrectly implies that northern cities like Syracuse or Albany did something or other to change the accent from the rural acreas, when the truth is that the rural accent around Syracuse is the same as that in the city. People move back and forth all the time. You have to have a big city like NYC or Boston to have enough isolation to create a new accent. There is no variation in accent anywhere from eastern NY to Syracuse, city, rural, or whatever, because people move around too much and there is no isolation. The first change going west happens in Rochester, where o changes to a. So, """"doctor"""" becomes """"dactor,"""" """"contact"""" lenses becomes """"cantact"""" lenses. I'm an optometrist, a dactor who fits cantacts whenever I'm in Rachester. Ha ha. I tell patients to turn their hat around and they turn their head around. e becomes a, so """"head"""" sounds like """"hat."""" I ask them, how do you say """"head"""" and they say """"heead."""" Buffalo gets worse, it has a Midwest accent, by everybody's opinion, and many Buffalo people think it's part of the Midwest. I think you are from Ohio, that's probably just like Buffalo. Believe it!

"""Along with the evident commitment of Wikipedians, I also found Wikipedia's numerous policies, guidelines and normative behaviors intimidating to me as a newcomer. Kraut and Resnick noted that techniques for encouraging voluntary compliance, such as explicitly stating and prominently displaying guidelines, tend to be more effective with """"insiders who care about the community’s health and their own standings within the community."""" They identified four factors which increase voluntary compliance: “commitment to the community, legitimacy of norms, the ability to save face, and expectations about rewards for compliance or sanctions for noncompliance.""""  With an underdeveloped sense of commitment to the community, a lack of comprehension regarding the strong community norms, and an expectation of sanctions for noncompliance, I was less likely to be bold, or participate, in the community unless directed to do so. The most paralyzing of these factors was the """"high probability that norm violations [would] be detected"""" ensured by Wikipedia's """"anyone can edit"""" community design.

 Bad news; looking into the article history, this isn't stable (failing GA criterion#5) given how there have been massive changes recently and content disputes. That alone is an automatic fail I'm afraid. Here's some other comments from a glance:

Having a really large number of pictures simply clutters the article
There are way too many lengthy quotes within the article; please paraphrase
Phrases like """"her glamorous lifestyle, beauty"""" and """"a savvy business woman"""" are not neutral
How her parents met (as well as the Howard Young bit) belongs in their own articles, not here
""""didn't allow her"""" should be """"did not allow her"""" per WP:CONTRACTIONS
The """"social circle"""" and """"gifted Taylor a pony when she was five years old"""" are superfluous
Time (magazine) shouldn't be fully capitalized
Please make sure every paragraph ends with at least one in-text citation
Her marriages should be in prose form rather than a numbered list
Friendship with Michael Jackson is trivial
Not sure if """"In 1971, Taylor became a grandmother at the age of 39"""" is necessary
The big quotes on her conversion to Judaism are simply overkill
For accolades, keep the focus on what she won; mere nominations that she lost aren't particularly noteworthy compared to actual wins
Having a """"filmography"""" section consisting solely of a link to Elizabeth Taylor filmography is ridiculously short and doesn't by itself inform readers of anything meaningful. Either list all of her films in this section or just include the link somewhere within the """"acting career"""" section.
The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography link is malformatted and contains a HARVref error.
Some dead links need to be fixed

Sorry, but I'm not going to put this on hold due to stability issues and too much unnecessary detail. Please resolve all disputes, reduce the number of quotes, remove all bias, and perhaps take to the Guild of Copy Editors before renominating. Better luck next time.  (talk / edits) """,0

 Moving Ahead 
I just found that I am unblocked now. This block reminded me of Hkelkar,Bakasuperman combination who used to get me blocked very often in very similar fashion. The longest block so far. Perhaps, longer ones are in the way! People have already threatened it on my talk page. Well, If I get challenged I feel more determination. One shocking fact I recently learnt is WP:ANI is up again. We had got it deleted earlier. It was WP:AN/I if I remember correctly. I had proposed, it has the potential of becoming another Fundywatchlist, which many others accepted and it got deleted. For those who are unaware of what Fundywatchlist was, I would like to elaborate, it was a page on wikipedia itself to discuss the ways to harass some users and POVise the pages in the name of cleaning and improvement. Members included were some Indian Admins, and a bunch of like minded users, who used to discuss whom to target and how to achieve their ends. It got deleted, and slowly the admins involved were shown the way out. However, these people started getting smarter, and found user:Yellowmonkey alias blnguyen, an American Vietnamese, as their mask. This guy was very popular among Indian circle and was acknowledged as good troubleshooter, though I always smelled something different. Hkelkar was in his good books, and once in a rv war on Kancha Ilaiah, article, where hkelkar was hell bent on writing a libellous term in lead, he went to the extent of not only protecting the page rv in his favor, but also shamelessly declared, """"I have protected the page for you"""". After that Ben W Bells Dispute Resolution started, who neglected my request to remove the term first, saying he cannot unprotect the page protected by a different admin. Majority ruling made Hkelkar, the winner. No, actually He didn't win, I left the page forever, because everybody was against me there. Blnguyen wrote a note there, just below my unprotect request, """"I didn't know it has stuck"""" However, what happened afterwards, is more interesting. I requested, checkuser on Hkelkar and tagged him as sockpuppeteer. Blnguyen, ritualistically, blocked me for bogus tagging - you can check my block log. and, lo, both checkuser and arbcom decision was in my favor. Since then blnguyen has never been shameless enough to look into my eyes. I could have raised finger on him during arbcom, though I dropped this idea later on, because one thing was evident Blnguyen was not a bad person, he was into bad company. Going through the talks above, I get the same feeling about many non-indian users here. 

While going thru the article, I could find few anomalies. 1) Ahirs claim descent from Abhira of central Asia - I have never read such a sentence anywhere else. If you are quoting jafferlot, he didn't use the word claim. If you are quoting Hiralal & Rusell, they are very much clear that Ahir is just a corruption of word abhira. From where this idea come s I would like to be educated. I find it rather funny, because you are saying they are claiming what they actually are and that too from central asia!!! I couldn't get the head and tail of it. Some indian languages still call them abhira. Translate this into one of them and sentence becomes Abhira claim descent from Abhira. What a nonesense!
2) Usage of word Yadavas, in one of the quotes, for present day Yadavs. Here, I have always said, both words are same and means the same thing. You are yourself using it interchangeably in the article.  But why you are confusing the readers, by artificially creating two titles. You cannot adopt a convention which is not in sync with real life usage. Sanskrit word Krishna can also be written as Krsna with few dots above and below different alphabets, however, they are still same. If you want to differentiate, present day Yadvas from ancient ones, better tag it as scriptural or mythical. 
3) Saying present day yadvas came into existence only after sanskritisation movement. Now tell me didn't British census record them as Ahir and gwal in different parts. Were they not Yaduvanshi before that??  Isn't it true that ancient sanskrit text, Amarkosa, calls Gopa, gwal and ballabha are Abhira synonym, and you still say they are a bunch of unrelated people. In fact we have many evidences for equating ahir with yadav and M.S.A. Rao summarizes them into two categories:1) Historical, and 2) semi-historical. I would like to learn why you keep on removing them. I didn't wrote, MSA Rao says this, because he is not the only one, so it was unnecessary. If you want you may dig deeper into earlier version of the article, it contains the link to snippet view of his statement too. 
4) Too much emphasis on Jafferlot and completely ignoring, Nesfield & H.A. Rose.FYI, the later carries more weight than Jafferlot. Jafferlot is rather infamous for his (mis)understanding of Ahir-Yadav. His recent comment on Babulal Gaur's statement exposes him, where he says, """"B",0

"""== It's not emo. ==

I had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo, only for someone to delete it. Stating that """"it is completely off topic, unproductive, unrelated to this article, and that belongs in a discussion forum"""" Hello, this is a discussion forum for the emo page, if we have an issue with something on it, it's suppose to be displayed here and talked over. Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn't fit to YOUR standards, it's for people to talk on.

With that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.

First off, I'd like to take the time to say. Read this, and don't reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don't want to hear it.

So here we begin...

Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck """"junk in a trunk"""" is? No, you'd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.

Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself. 
Within The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)

""""The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven's Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio's siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven's Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.""""

All of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you'd not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it's a story. Get over it and stop with all of this """"scene"""" stuff. 

It's all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about """"I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny""""

Understand what I am pointing out?

Emo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly. 
So, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic. This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldn't be in this """"Emo label"""" scene.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Doesn't matter if they are or aren't emo.  They're listed here as a band that has been called emo.  In fact, that's the point of the paragraph - to demonstrate how nebulous the term is.

If you want the related Wikipedia guidelines - all we have to do is supply a reliable source (per WP:RS) that confirms that C&C; have been called emo.  Source.  That's it.  That's all we need.  Any amount of rambling about how they are or aren't emo is irrelevant.  

And you trust MTV? The people that don't even play music anymore, pathetic. Well, I counter your source with mine.  Source.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Did you really read what I wrote?  It doesn't matter if they're emo or not.  We're not using C&C; as an example of an emo band, we're using C&C; as an example of a band that's been called emo.  They've been called emo, so they're mentioned.  Period.

(BTW - click on the """"tag"""" page of your """"source"""".)  

Honestly, I read it. But I don't give a damn what you wrote. Apparently you are one of those """"I must be right, or heaven shall fall"""" type of people. But, yet again. So you're making your own rules for Wikipedia now? You know, the public place? ....Cute.

But, as always there is that one prick in the crowd. You know what though, KoRn sings about sad matters, about how they are lonely and scared little boys and no one gets them. Maybe they should be on that list of """"exmaples"""", I've heard them be called emo before. (This is a retort, personally I like KoRn) With that.

Errr...Joanot, who told you that you have binding authority to establish votings which by-pass wikipedia policies and, not happy with that, fixing deadlines etc? Did you see yourself like a neutral editor or an administrator taking care of this page? Because you are not either, are you?

You can organize as many polls as you want, establish very strict deadlines, limiting the answers to YES or NO, etc. All very impressive. But you just can't by-pass the wikipedia policies nor the consensus we had reached here over the months just because you would like to rewrite the article in each and every contentious points (about the rest, you never cared in the slightest). All like if many different editors wouldnt have worked on that (including you) and like if all the work and agreements were, all of a sudden, worthless just because you think so. It doesnt work like that, Mr.

There are two very clear policy guidelines below in the last """"Once Again"""" thread which you havent bothered to reply, didnt you notice them? or maybe is it so much more fun to organize a poll and email everybody and their grandmother from ca:wiki which you think will support your point of view rather than stickign to boring policy rules?. Or maybe you noticed these two policies but, since you are a smart guy, you looked the other way and made like if they werent there because they are definite and crystal clear, even if you dont like them (at least I agree with you in that polls are definitely much more entertaining than wikipedia policies, but life is life and there are some rules to abide, even if you dont like them)

In any case, whether you like them or not, policies are binding, and, fortunately they are clear enough in this case.

As for polls, do you know this other policy? WP:DEMOCRACY? let me quote it for you just in case, because it seems made for you:

Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy or any other political system. Its primary method of determining consensus is through editing and discussion, not voting. Although editors occasionally use straw polls in an attempt to test for consensus, polls or surveys may actually impede rather than assist discussion. They should be used with caution, if at all, and will not be treated as binding.

So now we have three policies against your wishes to rewrite this article the way you would like it. Three policies against nothing but a lot noise and a massive attack to the existing consensus which generally works well for everybody, except for you.

It's because of the pan-Canadianist pretense that because BC is a province of Canada, it should have a bilingual name (why this is done for the Latin """"Nova Scotia"""" into French, when we don't say """"New Scotland"""" in English, is another matter); I agree with you and I think once-upon-a-time removed the French, but I guess it's back.

And this article doesn't even really talk about what makes emo emo, and I know someone like you couldn't do that either. Instead of talking about what kind of music or vocals are used, time is wasted on lyrical content. Those are words. Lyrics do not define music genres. Anyone can write a song about any topic they want. The point of the genre is to describe the actual music involved and how it's played. Where's the fact that bands very rarely used clean, melodic singing vocals early on? It was either a yelling/screaming type vocal from hardcore, or they would actually just talk in the songs like how bands like Indian Summer and Moonraker did. Genre is how you play, not what you say.

"Request for comment 

 an incident has occurred within the church involving some type of sexual scandal. There is a discussion between the churches ip and members of Wikipedia if this  Between 1984 and 1989 John Langworthy was a youth minister at Prestonwood Baptist Church. On January 22nd, 2013, Langworthy pled guilty to five of eight felony counts of gratification of lust against young boys, receiving a suspended sentence of 50 years. He was also required to register as a sex offender. The offences occurred at Morrison Heights Baptist Church in Clinton, MS.[11] It was reported that Langworthy also admitted, in a pulpit confession, to prior sex offenses at Prestonwood Baptist Church. Some of the alleged victims made complaints to Prestonwood Church at the time, which were dealt with internally by church officials.[12] There are now allegations that Prestonwood Baptist Church covered up Langworthy's offenses by failing to report them to the proper authorities.

""":::::: Dear Chris, It took me a while to uderstand what happened. Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your """"seen in the above insulting comments"""" which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say """"where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". Why do you think that """"Einstein, Landau and Feynman"""" are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned """"world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture.

 If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier. 

 If I'm wrong (you don't believe that there is a God) then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis (actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we can't discuss it anymore). So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one. Advice to BB folks: state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you won't need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you. Otherwise you'll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein, Landau and Feynman since they don't understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have.

 The VERY Naive Perspective 

This was stated:

'There was no implication that ALL VNR's are propaganda.  If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda, which I infer is undisputed, then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral.'

Separated into two concepts: 
a) that """"There was no implication that ALL VNRs are propaganda."""" 
-and-
b) """"If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda ... then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral."""" 

In regards to the first:-
A Video """"News"""" Release by the government, which is ( as they, a priori, are ) intended to create the appearance of congruity for an idea which aids the government through causing an apparent or actual concordance between the beliefs of those in control and those being controlled is, by definition, propaganda.
In regards to the second:-
Is the statement that the labeling of VNR's is an ideologically neutral act?  It would not be, as, through labeling it, one is categorizing it ideologically. 

Please do not misunderstand, IMHO VNR's are an advanced form of embedded propaganda which elegantly use the psycholinguistic concept contained in the idea """"The Fish do not see the Water"""". In Communication Studies, Propaganda Studies, even Neuro-Linguistic Programming NLP( which, while it is a controversial system, is based on common-sense """"slight of mind"""" techniques.) the Sandwich Formula of:
/true statement -> statement intended to be perceived as true -> true statement/
is being used here. Example: 6 o'clock news, tired Americans sit down to eat and watch the news. In the middle of verifiable and true information segments a VNR is placed, so the end effect of 'Rain tomorrow //-> VNR Information //-> Gas is up by 1 cent' is to believe 3 new facts, not 2 and one to question.

My 2 cents,

Writing new guidelines that general folks understand
18-July-2009: These recent events have just re-confirmed what I've been telling people for years: Wikipedia runs on mobocracy, despite other people claiming (for years), """"No, no, WP decisions are made per logical reasoning, in accordance with written policies"""". Well, actually, that's not how decisions have been made, for several years, as of July 2009. I'm not quite sure what the problem is with the wiki-masses, in this attitude, that """"truth"""" is a popularity contest. There can't be a massive, multi-year wiki-cabal, so I suspect these mob-judgments are simply what happens when ordinary folk are challenged to think.Many school teachers have concluded that thinking must be taught to most people. In America, people are not allowed, typically, to become official judges without some type of formal judicial education, where they must pass standards of clear thinking. Not just anyone can sit on the bench, and start making decisions that affect thousands of other people.We have to write reality-based guidelines, with totally obvious examples, so that anyone could understand them. The wiki-masses don't follow concepts such as """"significant coverage"""" in reliable sources: I must conclude the current WP policies are like wiki-calculus for the masses. They cannot calculate wiki-integrals of the policies to reach a logical conclusion. Hence, the current policies are a failure for coordinating general editors.So, these bogus AfD discussions are such a waste of time, re-hashing misunderstandings as confirmed by popularity votes. We have to write policy essays to explain actual examples to be followed: I don't think there's any other hope. Most people just don't understand the current policy points, no matter how carefully that text is quoted in discussions. They see """"NOTINHERITED"""" and that's the extend of their reading: 2 words is a policy to them. Perhaps they started to read the policy text (yawn) and re-zoned to the 2 words, period.

PNRS, human. PNRS, human. PNRS>human. The only problem is that your analogy at this point no longer correlates to the real-world thing it was supposed to analogize. It isn't that we have detected PNRS's twice and found they were generated by humans, therefore the third PNRS we detect is probably human. Rather, the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on Earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several PNRS's, and they all turned out to be generated by natural phenomenon. Somewhere in the ID article, it says that ID is not meant to replace (insert laundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces), and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process. Those are PNRS's that were proven to be generated by an odd arrangement of pulsars, not alien lifeforms. The flagella on bacteria is just another PNRS in this analogy. And while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet, we have several other complex PNRS's that we know were created naturally, so rather than leap to the conclusion that """"a designer created flagella"""", science says """"no further information known"""". There's a concept that feels like you aren't grasping here: science is patient in the face of an unknown. science deals with the unknown all the time. But just because something is unknown doesn't mean science finds it neccessary to leap to a conclusion or redefine itself. natural science has defined itself as empirical, observable, repeatable knowledge. And that's worked pretty good for the last couple of centuries, even though when the first natural scientists came about, they knew practically nothing, and everything was unknown from a rigorous, scientific point of view. If one were to look at ID from a purely scientific point of view and ignore all the political intent, ID is so impatient """"to know"""" that it discards centuries of scientific practices to find some answer based on subjective measures like """"legitimate possibility"""" or """"probable explanation"""".

>Hello Beaumont,I noticed that you have recently joined the Dzierzon discussion and especially Dzierzon's self-identification. You may want to read his own biography and look at his family photos at [56].
What exactly the autobiography is supposed to prove? That he wrote German. And where he identifies himself as German? And what the photos suppose to proof?
>He himself states that his mother Maria and father Simon had a small farm in the same place in Silesia. In other words they were longtime burghers of Silesia, as well as him.
Yes there was. “Name of his great-grandfather Jerzy (1717-1800) appears in the oldest Polish chronicles of Lowkowitz “(W. Kocowicz 1987).
>You look at the church records with birth, marriage, death from Lowkowitz and surrounding area and all his Dzierzon family members, who all wound up after 1945 in Western Germany and you find no traces at all of either him or his parents having moved from Poland to Silesia, Germany.
It only proof that the official language was German and Germanization was on the way look V. Raczek, Erinnerungeu all den Altmelster der Bienenzuclit Dr. Dzierzon
>His grave stone also identifies him as Johann Dzierzon.
The grave stone is repeatedly mentioned by many as proof. The stone was funded by Austrian Beekeepers’ Association and have nothing to do with Dzierzon’s family will. I already mentioned about it in earlier part of the discussion. Lokk up.
>The only Polish people, who came to the Silesian town, I find reference to, is by the way on the current Polish Kluczbork.. (?) site, which tells us that Protestant Polish people took refuge there in the 1600's. We all know, that the Counter-Reformation and the Jesuits 'convinced' the Silesians and others to re-catholizise. Perhaps that is, where Johann Dzierzon had gotten his surname from.
You like to forgot that orginal population of Silesia was Polish people. Look for “Recoveret Teritories” article. The orginal Polish language survived for hundred od years. (It is not exceptional facts you can found such event on Lithuania and others countries where the native language was not changed in vilages) As you can imagine because the schools were fewer.
>I have not seen any self-description of him by himself as a Pole.
I am not surprised of it. German do not publicized such thinks. You need read Polish. You have editions by Polish authors in English. You can find them in “Literature” sections. Also you disbelieve recent Polish authors but you believe on NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer (his editions are 50-70 years old). I ask many times for recent German beekeeping historians who says Jan Dzierzon was German.
>The wikipedia Polish group, lead by A Serafin, who is also Nr. 131.. are the only ones with a note from a 1961 book, which is added to the incorrectly named Jan Dzierzon wikipedia article.
The correct name of Jan Dzierzon is Dzierżon the z is with dot above. “Dzierżyć” means to keep in Polish language. What do you mean a note from 1961. All Polish beekeeping historians says Dzierzon was Polish. You just disregard parts which are inconvenient.
>This not only claims, that he said that, but insisting on, that he actually did say that. Where is the actual proof? 
In Kluczbork museum. There is many more interesting thinks about the Polish Dzierzon family and their testimonies. I will encourage you to find proof of yours statement JD was German. Nobody yet give me one except the NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer scribbles. Autobiography do not say anything of such, we already know it, is not? 
>That quote, supposedly from him,'identifying himself as a Polish person', actually just says, that his surname is a Polish-based surname.
The citation say: “Regarding my nationality, I AM obviously, just as my name says, Polish of birth, since on Silesia people speak Polish…” in Polish version is: """"Samo moje nazwisko mówi, żem Polak z urodzenia"""" which is “just my name says I AM Pole of birth” Further the sentence says: “because from 10 birthday I found myself in Breslau and I studied there I become German educated, but the education does not accept borders or nationality.” I did not include the other part before as I avoided irritating Germans chauvinists. Now you have it.
Original Polish text: „Co do mojej narodowości, jestem oczywiście, jak już samo nazwisko moje mówi, Polakiem
z urodzenia, gdyż na Śląsku mówi się po polsku, a że od 10 roku życia znalazłem się we Wrocławiu i tam studiowałem, stałem się Niemcem z wykształcenia. Ale nauka nie uznaje granic ani narodowości.”
Original in Museum of. J. Dzierżona in Kluczborku, sygn. 35, 14, 11 Folge, Zur Charakteristik Dr. J. Dzierzon.
Are you really assume that Prussia was an asylum of tolerance and love? If so you would be surprise. Dzierzon did not have a reason to love Prussia.

The J.D. is not a doctoral level degree. That someone chooses to call it that means nothing.

The D.C. was often lumped in there, but they're made an effort to get more people to have completed a B.S. first to raise their standing, as pharmacy is trying to do. As mentioned, in many fields the terminal degree is a master's, for example in many artistic fields (M.F.A.). I clearly recall arguments, reported in The Chronicle of Higher Ed., over whether a J.D. holder should be a university's president given the lack of a terminal/doctoral degree.

In my experience, J.D. holders occasionally use """"Doctor"""" in very formal settings in academiaif speaking at a graduation ceremonybut for the most part, no.

Track connections between subway lines
As far as I know, there are no connections, direct OR indirect between the lines. The Red Line MAY have a connection to the Commuter Rail at the Cabot Yard or at a track near Neponset (just north of the Neponset River), but I doubt it. The Blue Line has no connections to any other rail lines. I think the Orange Line has a connection at Wellington, and the Green Line has only Riverside. So there MAY very indirect connections between the Red, Orange and Green, but they are never used except in emergencies (like when the Green Line flooded and Commuter Rail trains served Riverside).   

Just checked a few sources. A June 2000 track map shows no connection at Wellington or anywhere else on the Orange Line. Same for the Red Line. Of course it also shows no Green Line connection at Riverside, and I know that exists (but is usually fenced off). The track I remember at Neponset is a dead end (Java). At Cabot Yard (Red Line) and South Bay Yard (Commuter Rail) the two systems are totally separated, lookign at aerials on that same site. So the only one remaining to check is Wellington.   

Now the Orange Line USED to connect via Everett Shops, as did the Green Line (via surface tracks under the El). And the Blue and Red connected over the Longfellow Bridge, and there may have been a connection at Eliot Street Yard in Harvard connecting the Red Line to the streetcar line to Watertown and thus the Green Line, but I'm not sure about that. But at one point the Longfellow Bridge track did connect to other streetcar tracks. And I think I found a connection north of Wellington on aerials at http://www.globexplorer.com/ , but I'm not sure - shouldn't be too hard to spot from the Commuter Rail (harder from the Orange Line because of the unused east track) if it exists. But even if there is an Orange-Green connection via Commuter Rail (and fairly direct at that, using the Grand Junction Line), I would very much doubt it gets any use.   

So how do you figure all those nice new Red Line cars were delivered from Barre, Vermont?

 

Ah, here we go. Blue has none. Red has one at JFK/UMass, Orange has one at Wellington (last used ca. 1981), and Green has one at Riverside. None appear to be used at the present time. It would be rather misleading to suggest that there are in fact connections. How's this?

"User Kannambadi, please do not try to frighten and justify blocks on me.  Did the person who blocked me on two occasions (first of all I do know, it was you and your other friends who cannot tolerate a counter opinion, who prompted the irresponsible blocking on the previous occasions.... you are again giving a seemingly sage advice for first discussing before carrying out edits.... do you remember what you told the user (I forget his name, but he was from Maharashtra)?  You wrote: I borrow from Kamath, you go and get it from a good library. I have a good library near my home and town, where the book is available. Thus, you left it all on the person countering YOUR opinion to prove otherwise.... Why not do the same thing this time around?  

I have indeed borrowed from two books called Ancient India, one by K.A.N.Sastri and R.C.Roychowdhuri. These are two books of the same name by the above named two authors with Roychowdhuri borrowing extensively from Sastri.  I also think that the book by K.A.N.Sastri is dated 1959 while the one of Roychowdhury is either 1951 or 1961, probably it is 1961 edition.  Roychowdhuri's book is quite different from the edition of the same book available on the internet at books.google.com/.

Please also try preaching the same to the irresponsible user who blocked me in that he should also have practiced what you are preaching me.... that is first indulge in a discussion before taking action to block contributors like me. Did he do that? He simply barged into my page like a bull in the china shop and blindly commented that I have made personal commentary on the Chola page and hence he was blocking me.  This after I had painstakingly borrowed from noted epigraphist Huntzsh's summary of the rule of the Chola empire where he had sought to dispel the notions that they were devout Saivites by saying that during the rule of the second Chola king i.e. Aditya I itself, two temples i.e. the Siva Temple of Chidambaram and the one at Srirangam being a Vishnu temple and regarded the most important Siva and Vishnu temples, were both declared as Kuladhanam (family heritage sites) for the Chola kings (ordaining in a way that the kings of this dynasty one after another will look personally after the upkeep of traditions at both the temples and their well being). Indeed, I made the mistake of not quoting Prof. Huntzsh (again courtesy the site you love to deride calling it a POV website despite using it to support points on Chalukyas and Hoysalas) but on my very next visit on the same day, I found that the 'department of dirty tricks' had prompted Blinguen to block me for the second time. Does Blinguen have any knowledge at all of Indian history, most of all of the history of the Cholas, Hoysalas or Pandiyans and most of all of your beloved Chalukya Cholas?  Certainly I would have loved to engage him on a one to one debate on Indian history especially that of South India.  I also wrote to Taprobanus wanting to prosecute Blinguen and requested for his address.  

It is a shame that cowards contacted him it seems on the email or on phone to complain about me, but no one ever wrote about it in the open, no one contacted me and most of all no one ever wanted to discuss the matter. Rather, people who scarcely contributed to the Chola page like user Earth etc. started advocating this and that.  Mind you, user Earth himself was adviced by another admin when he complained about me that the contributions made by me were in good faith only, but it seems ultimately the dirty gang on wikipedia bent upon converting it into some sort of monkeypedia finally had their say.

What you basically always do is you want to write and not just that, you want whatever you write to be retained at all costs, but in the process, you forget counter opinions by other historians as well.  K.A.N.Sastri has written in his book (as opposed to what you wrote quoting Kamath that Satyasraya defeated crown prince Rajendra), that Rajendra Chola defeated Satyasraya (he wrote something like: next was the turn of Satyasraya who fled the battlefield near the fields of Hottur-??) and hid in the jungles of Kogali and Kadambalige.  I would say 'exactly' for you find among the limited number of inscriptions available of Satyasraya (courtesy: the site you always try to trash inscriptions.whatsindia.com/) which are indeed found at Kogali and Kadambalige and in fact in a couple of these inscriptions Satyasraya even is called as 'ruling from Kadambalige'. Kindly access this information in the same manner as I have done and exactly in the same manner as you expect others to do, i.e. access appropriate information from appropriate sources.   Even in this, I do not want to claim whatever I say is correct, indeed if Satyasraya is attributed by Kamath with victory over Rajendra then kindly also quote other sources where Rajendra claims victory over the Chalukyas including the most important Wo",0

I recently established a page for Sadie Benning's video """"Girl Power"""". I've been notified that the page was challenged for its presumed insignificance (not enough """"notability"""").

This video has been discussed amongst scholars and academics who focus on everything from art history to gender studies and from new media studies to sociology.

 About the topic ban of Wilhelmina Will from DYK 

I've been trying to figure out what happened with the AN/I report that led to a topic ban for WW. Normally, when the community makes a decision that requires admin tools to implement or enforce, there is a closing administrator. I've reviewed the report and have summarized it at User:Abd/Will ANI incident (at this point, this is a long summary, not a short one, I will prepare a short version if it's later needed.) And I just realized that there never was a close to that report, which explains why WW wasn't informed, that would normally be a task undertaken by a closing admin. Now, you later described the report as a consensus to topic ban, and you did inform WW, but you reported it passively, as if it had not been your decision, you were just the messenger.

I easily understand how it happened, and assume nothing but good faith on your part, but there was a fundamental error here. The community does not make decisions by vote. Rather, it uses agents, public servants, who make decisions after review of community comment, but the servants are responsible for reviewing the arguments, and vote count isn't the issue except as a very rough guide, and I've seen many decisions, made by highly competent administrators, which ran directly contrary to a large majority of votes, based on a review of the arguments.

So I'm asking you if you did this. Did you review the arguments and decide that they were cogent and that a topic ban was in the best interests of the project. If you did not, would you do so now and """"close,"""" i.e., take personal responsibility for the decision? In which case you could then inform us as to the length of the ban, or any other conditions imposed. And there would then be, if another administrator wishes to lift the ban, a responsible admin to contact?

I will tell you that my now much more detailed review of the facts leads me to the conclusion that a ban wasn't justified at all, there was no disruption at DYK from Wilhelmina Will, and there was very minor misbehavior elsewhere which only gets connected with DYK because of her presumed motive. A general conclusion from those who understand DYK seems to be that there is nothing wrong with the motive, and that what WW did was simply some minor foolishness, of a kind that would normally pass almost unnoticed, and which she has not continued. So, in spite of her seeming disregard of warnings, she clearly hasn't disregarded them, she just quietly complied. Yes, she should learn to respond, it would help. But I have never seen a response to a warning as being a condition for not blocking. The procedure is Warn. Wait for repeated offense. Block if repeated. Not Warn. Wait for promise to comply. Block if no promise.

There were several issues raised:
Mesodermchelys misbehavior: short term, over one or two days, 2 improper reverts to preserve word count. 3 edit summaries that express her personal reaction to Blechnic  which, after reviewing what he had done, I fully understand and sympathize with. She was foolish to make those edit summaries, but it wasn't disruptive, and it wasn't personal attack within the meaning given at WP:NPA, whereas she was under repeated PA within that meaning: an attempt to damage her reputation.
Copyright violations. Evidence was requested at ANI, but none was provided, links were given by Blechnic that showed nothing of the kind. He is now attempting to build a case on his Talk page  he now refers to all of her edits as crap, later amended to vandalism  and what he cited was a sentence in a seven-month-old article which, it turns out, she had noticed in the Sandbox and asked an admin if she could use it, and she failed to check for copyvio. The sentence was a direct copy. Maybe. Or was it that a web site later took the sentence from Wikipedia? I certainly don't know. Easy to fix. No pattern shown.
Incivility. But the example given, as far as I recall, was always back to the Mesodermochelys incident. And then reference was made to her lying about it, claiming that her leetspeak comment was really a note to herself about something else. This was a clumsy excuse that simply shows that she is naive. And which was harmless, except to her own reputation.
Accuracy of her articles. She has made mistakes. However, what I've seen with WW articles on scientific subjects is that, particularly if they are DYK nominated, whatever errors are in them are rapidly fixed. The articles aren't an obstacle to the creation of accurate content, rather they facilitate it, particularly by being DYK nominated. In other words, if there is, in fact, a problem here, DYK is part of the solution, not part of the problem. But, in fact, her articles are much better than the average new article on Wikipedia.

I wanna discuss this with someone, but it does say this page is not opened to discussion!

One thing though!

Rome belongs to Greece! and that is the new world order we need to follow! It was the greek empire not roman empire who had occupy israel. As evidince we have the term """"centaurion"""" who appars in the gospel, which derives from the greek mythology. A centaurion came forth to Jesus and asked if he could heal his servant. The 'centaurion' in the gospel would supposingly be a leader of the military, a horseman. Now the centaurion asked Jesus if he could heal his servant, he said that he also had people under him. And he added, """"if i say to my people """"come"""" he comes, and if i say to my people """"go"""" he goes"""". And jesus answered: """"Truly truly i say to you, in israel i haven't found so much faith in anyone"""".

Ah, yes.  You two know that it probably isn't prudent for me to say much about him now.

Instead, let's take a different tack, okay?  
A challenge to those at WP:AN
A number of people have been discussing various moves by me.  In an attempt to help clarify the issues, I respectfully issue the following challenge:
Go to Wikipedia:Requested moves and make a request for Eduardo Perez to be moved to Eduardo Pérez, providing the proper discussion space on the talk page in accordance with the instructions at WP:RM, etc.
Then give everyone who has commented about my moving articles should be given a chance to weigh in on that requested move.  Put together all that collective brainpower, and more importantly, all that spirit of cooperative editing, to work to try to resolve the question of which of those two names should occupy the unique spot available for the article's name, in accordance with our Wikipedia:Naming conventions.
Consider what you could support based on the article as it stands today, with nothing specifically identified as a reference, but with two entries under """"External links"""" to statistics pages.  Based on what I could see, in other words.
Look for and discuss additional sources of information, to support either the """"Eduardo Pérez"""" spelling or the """"Eduardo Perez"""" spelling.
Add appropriate references to the article, if they are """"reliable sources"""".
If anyone who has commented about me in this regard hasn't jumped in of his or her own accord within a couple of days, seek them out and specifically invite their input to achieve the best cooperative result.
This will provide a wonderful opportunity to """"teach by example"""".
Then, no matter where it ends up, we will probably accomplish one thing.  Those who want to talk about naming conventions issues will at least have some little bit of experience with and understanding for the potential issues involved.

History:  This article was started with the name Eduardo Perez more than two years ago, and remained that way until moved to Eduardo Pérez without discussion and no edit summary here 10 Oct 2007 by User:Kolins.  Later, I moved back the undiscussed, unreferenced move of the longstanding name. There have been no edits since, and Talk:Eduardo Perez is a blank slate, unused but for the ubiquitous WikiProjects and BLP boxes filling up a couple of screens.

Or, perhaps it would be even more instructive to add one additional step first.  Let Husond first show you how an old pro, one well versed in the workings of Wikipedia, would handle this.  Let him first move it back to Eduardo Pérez, then request page protection on the page.  Then, once that page protection is in place, you can request the move in the opposite direction, from Eduardo Pérez to Eduardo Perez.

Same encouragement of participation by anyone involved in that WP:AN discussion, of course, no matter which direction the move is requested.  All that changes is the burden of proof (something Husond is well aware of, but might not have been considered by everyone else). It might have some effect on the ensuing discussion or not, I can't predict what will happen in this case. Leave the discussion open for the normal five days or more, with of course anyone who is following the article just because they are baseball fanatics or whatever free to jump into the discussion as well.

That discussion, of course, ought to be able to proceed quite smoothly and amicable, since you won't have to worry about a disruptive character like me jumping in there. ;-)

Does that sound do-able?  Either direction, I don't care.  You choose.   19:13""",0

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada maintained that Mohammad and Jesus, were empowered representatives of God, saktiavesa avataras.[184] In a variety of other points of view, some translated the phrase """"the last prophet"""", suggesting that Vedic deity Agni is none other but Muhammad.[185] In 1926 Siddiq Hussain's two-volume Kannada book, Ja at Guru Sarwar-i 'Alam, argued that the Muhammad was actually Kalki avatar whose arrival had been predicted in the Hindu scriptures, however this view is not a widely accepted doctrine.[186] On the other hand Mirza Ghulani Ahmad argued that Rama and Krishna were prophets of God who had foretold the arrival of Muhammad as God's last law-bearing prophet.[187] Mohammad is sometimes linked to the passage of the Rig Veda declaring that Narashams rishi will arrive as the """"last divine messenger"""" (antim deva duta), who shall """"dispel all darkness"""" and """"conquer death"""".[188]""",0

And the use of """"Britain and the US never existed"""" was too much in my view. They could simple have remained neutral while the Axis fought against the Soviets.

""""Regarding the Japanese decision not to attack the USSR (in Dec 1941 and Dec 1942), they did plan to do so in the case of major Soviet defeats under Moscow or Stalingrad. However, that hadn't happen, and the role of the Western allies was minimal in that. In addition, as some scholars believe, the Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) lesson was duly learnt by the IJA staff.""""

Minimal? Stalin loved the oil embargo that Roosevelt put in Japan. It could have been this very factor that saved his neck. The Japanese were a military government, and both the Army and Navy did put pressure for their attacks. The attack in the in the Pacific was purely desesperation. If Roosevelt didn't mather with the Soviets, it was just question to give the Japanese their oil and good will to put them against Stalin. However at this time the US was already allied with the Soviet cause. And I don't remember were I read now, but the US embassador even treath the Japanese embassador in a conversation if they launched an attack against the USSR.

About Nomonhan, the IJA staff learned some serious lessons on how to FIGHT the Soviets with it. The Army never give up of the idea of attack the USSR. Even the Navy had some simpaty for the cause if it's advance in the Pacific would not be halted. War between the two countries was probably inevitable. Get rid of the Communist treat was one of the largest security problems for Japan. Matsuoka's secretary comments this in the World at War Banzai episodie. He said: """"But when an integration against the north parted [oil] the Army naturally joined up with the Navy"""". Obviosly, only for maintein the war in China and could fight the Soviets in the future because the critical resources needed.

Battle of the Bulge:

Why the Soviets can loose like they did in Barbarossa and this be extremely analized by hypocrital """"intelectuals"""" like you and the causes of one supossed less than expected performance the Western Allies not be?

Battles are won by several factors. Anacronism is not nice here. The Western Allies win in the Bulge. The Soviet sucess in Bagration for instance, was not garanteed when it was launched. It could had end up much worse than in the Bulge. With even defeat.

Re::: Lend Lease:

Yes, the Soviets could produce everything they needed. Look the link I posted above. The importance of the Lend Lease is well illustrated. Also, no Lend Lease, less material produced, more casualities for the Soviet side. They would resist this and the combined offensive of all the Axis powers? Pehaps, isn't? I'm just trying to point all this is something of impossible complexity, and therefore should be let in the field of personal opinions. 

""""That means about 40,000 German tanks were not built'' And what crew was supposed to drive these tanks? Germany had a desperate situation with personnel, due to the Eastern front""""

Perhaps they wouldn't have if they could master their forces there from the start. 

Also the money and the time spent with the subs could be used to solve many other problems, produced even more refined weapons, and this includes weapons of mass destruction. 

I'm here to """"fight"""" with you as long as I can. But one thing you already admit: you don't belive the USSR could hold all the Axis countries together.

""":: Hmm, Thinking about it, getting involved in a more elaborate argument around the question the question of rigor or lack-there-of is fairly useless. To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book """"The Real Split In The International"""" could just as well be called the """"fundamental split"""" if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both. 
Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff. Indeed, in the clearly partisan Bob Black essay the introductory paragraphs still winds-up with a somewhat more balanced view of the group than the current entry here (though clearly there's still a """"revive the honor of forgotten Second Situationist Internation"""" thing going on). 
In anycase, I reviewed the history of text and it seem that the first or two paragraphs are essentially tacked-on afterwards. This explains the disjointed quality of the text as a whole - it clearly needs rewriting. 
As far as links go, certainly inclusive links are another option - it is simply that the entry would have to be vastly MORE inclusive than the present entry if you wanted to include all links to comments and critiques on the Situationists.

 Re. Please advise. 

Hello Mareklug. Well, I believe that your request at WP:RFPP might have been declined due to the fact that the edit war was just starting and there was thus insufficient information of a full scale edit war that would have surely resulted in full protection to the article (by the way, that's how we call it: we don't """"block"""" articles, we """"protect"""" them). If the edit war continues, then do relist your request at WP:RFPP. It will likely to be accepted. I also have to agree that you might have failed to control yourself sometimes, when in the face of your opponent Tocino. Edit warring is never a good choice, as it only worsens a dispute and can indeed grant blocks to both of you (although I think that a topic ban would be quite an unlikely/draconian measure, you're not causing that much trouble as far as I see). My suggestion is, when Tocino (or any other user) makes an edit that you strongly disagree with, refrain from reverting right away and instead, summon the other party to the talk page. Then two things may happen: either he joins the discussion so you can both argue your points of view, or he doesn't join the discussion and provides you with a good reason for requesting an administrator's intervention against his unilateral actions.

  Not done: please be more specific about what needs to be changed.   

 Use in Belgium and The Netherlands.. way off. 

Not only does the paragraph not explain the """"Hogeschool"""" (literal translation) system that provides Associate and Bachelor degrees, the information it provides about secondary education is wrong in some key points. Since I can't directly edit, I thought I might sum it up here.

Children are required to attend school from 6 to 18 in Belgium and 5 to 18 in The Netherlands or until they attain a specific level of education (BE: any secondary education, NL: HAVO, VWO or a level 2 MBO). See Dutch government website on 'leerplicht' and Flemish regional government's page on the same subject. Not relevant for Hogeschool, but faulty info in the article nontheless.

Dutch MBO is not considered school for the first two years, it is always considered school (unlike a """"Hogeschool"""", that functions as a University in terms of application, funding etc).

Now I don't know exactly how the Flemish equivalent of Hogeschool/High-school is used, but i'll sum up how it works in the Netherlands from the lowest level up until Hogeschool (usually translated as """"University of Applied Sciences""""). I'll skip internal stuff on VMBO and MBO, basically VMBO level determines MBO starting leve and you can always go up a MBO level(1-4) if you want to spend the time.

MBO level 4 provides access to almost all(1) Hogeschool Associate (120 ECTS) and Bachelor (240 ECTS) programs. Associate degrees are more of a technicality, unknown to employers and unused in most programs, but they exist.
Completing the first year (also known as Propedeuse) of a Hogeschool program grants access to almost all(1) University Bachelor programs.

1)Additional requirements may be set, usually involving math or language courses attended.

Hogescholen (and Universities) must offer access to their Associate and Bachelor programs to potential students aged 21 and up via 'Colloquium Doctum'. Here's some more info from a Dutch University in English on that subject, including a reference to the article of Dutch law about 'Colloquium Doctum'. The same system is often used when potential students lack certain courses from previous studies.

Regarding the article as a whole, it seems to lack sources overall, I feel it should be open for editing or otherwise overhauled to apply only to the term """"high school"""" and it's literal translations, redirecting to articles about secondary/higher education if needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.171.32.96   

 Is high school in comics a valid category? About half of super hero's are teenagers.

 Tones 

I heard that Cantonese music differs from Mandarin in that Mandarin respects the language tones in the melody, but Cantonese doesn't. Is it true?
 

 Good Cantopops do respect the language tones in the melody, as all Chinese dialects are tone-sensitive. What you heard is a recent disaster in HK music, beautiful face is more important than singing skills and so songs become less important.  But there are still many real musicians care about the tones and the melody. 

Cantonese is more tonal than Mandarin.  Mandarin only has 4 tones for each pronunciation, but Cantonese has at least 6 tones according to most dictionaries.  Some author even claims there are 9 tones in Cantonese.  Even though written Chinese can be pronunced in Cantonese or Mandarin, but the sound differs so much that you cannot sing a Cantonese song in Mardarin nor vice versa.  Many popular tunes get both Cantonese and Mandarin lyrics which are totally rewritten and sometimes with unrelated subjects.   20:31, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Yes but Mandarin has a more pleasant rhythm when spoken with natural darkness and light and this translates into songs pleasnter on the ear.I've heard people talk about Cantonese as sounding like a machine gun on the ear. 

And, how do Cantopop artists deal with music piracy? 
 

 Cantopop artists deal with piracy using the same technique as European or American artists, i.e. virtually nothing they can do!!! 

 But I was under the impression that in HK and Canton, media piracy was much much higher than in Europe or America. But there still are Cantopop artists. Are the economic models different? Do they resort to corporate patronage? ...  

 Curious: How did you hear that """"height"""" in Cantonese areas?  00:40 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 I meant South China in general, but it should affect Cantopop. My source is Slashdot . Ehem. I think I read something in Wired of Bruce Sterling finding dirt-cheap pirated media there, but I don't find it. I though tit was common knowledge.  

You have some of the most popular cantopop stars e.g. Joey Yung and Twins going on TV and saying how poor they are and asking their fans not to steal their livlihoods.And yes they do resort to corporate patronage of a sort.In the Joey Yung interview I was referring to, she claimed that she was making no money on her albums, but that she still had to produce albums to keep herself in the public eye and maintain her fanbase.

Those edits you've noted were, in fact, fighting a particular ANTISEMITIC person. His edits were such that he claimed Lazar Kaganovich was responsible for the Ukrainian Holodomor BECAUSE he was Jewish (and he tried to use Jewwatch as a source), tried to remove Israel from a list of countries selling pringles based on the incorrect assumption that Israel is not a country, and then went around inserting """"is a person of Jewish descent"""" into articles about Jews he did not like. I was not denying Jews peoplehood, I was corecting the fallacy that Judaism is only a genetic ethnicity, which is a lie perpetrated by people like Hitler. Sposer explained it to you exactly as I would have. There are many many Jews who are not decendents of the original Hebrews. There are people who converted, people who were the product of mixed marriages in Europe, etc. They are Jews too. Concentrating on the religion aspect does not deny peoplehood, rather it eliminates the fallacy that Jews are a """"race"""" only.

I and I alone provided for mankind the most powerful machine since the dawn of time. I was foolish to think I'd get a meeting with the president or the Nobel peace prize. I guess I had my little finger cocked the wrong political way when I did it. Since this was known the forces that be have turned their evil cannons of jealousy toward me and ignored every rule in the book, played every unfair card in the book known and made as many unfair ones they could get their hands on to destroy me and steal it and gain credit for themselves on it. You have to decide if you are on the side of truth and life that I intended for this technology to bring or allow those lord high felons to destroy me with unfair and unequally applied rules. Are you going to be a part of that? Why do I say this? Because if I don't stand no honest person will forever thereafter. Have Wikipedia editors blocked William R. Buckley for the admitted first attack here and thereafter continual attacks, one short one and he's back at it,... or blocked SteveBaker for vandalism at all as he continues to do now and do as much damage to me he can? No. Or punished those dealing out blocks to me when they knew I did nothing for political bias? Did Wikipedia give me credit for my work and ban the copyright infringer and ultimate dark and threatening talker Freitas and Merkle  from this place NO! 

Wikipedia's rules clearly allow the publishing of lies from longer standing people of note, no mater how nefariously they slam the up and coming and tell lies far and wide and Wikipedia knowingly lets them. This is a media rag, period. Like any other. There are no real rules when they apply differently to one than another. Further, again, if you are being destroyed by unfair rules you have a Boston Tea party. Get it? It's called """"self defense"""" something you clearly do not understand. The only rule is a fair one and I don't see you or any other here trying to keep them fair in any way form of fashion you are just blowing political smoke. If you did we would not be here. I have not once been treated fairly and I don't see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here. You speak of rules, then block those that wrongly attacked me first before I even had a chance to play fair. Before I stuck my head out of the womb as a newbie around here. Don't walk away when I am being punished wrongly and you know it and above all don't drag my good name through the mud like a pig would do Mr. media guy. If you treat me fairly, you would be the first, from Larry King to Don and Mike to the Chief of police in Prince William County Virginia who had me arrested five times knowing I was innocent saying I was crazy for just talking about a self-replicator, even with my patent in my hand, gold seal and all (and you won't write of that here, not fairly). You want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now (but you wont). But most of all punish those who start the transgressions, not those fighting to defend themselves from the initial onslaught. And do not tell me you do not have special preferences around here.

I have contacted every lawyer on the list at the patent office and they will not sue a university professor (to answer you that question). Do me a fair article and you will never hear from me again because I am only here to fight a bad bio attack on me, that is all. I don't like Wikipedia because the rules are unfair here,woirse than any other media operation I've known.

If I'm going to be indef blocked then User:Smsarmad (SMS), the guy who filed SPI without notifying me, should also be indef blocked. He has been abusing Indian and Afghan editors, creating and using multiple accounts since at least 2008, illegally uploading many images, using proxies, vandalizing Pashtun related, Afghan related and Indian related pages.  
This SPI investigation report from 2007 clearly establishes that he is a disruptive vandal  and lives in Islamabad, Pakistan , has used socks and open proxy located in Greece. 
 began calling me dark-skinned Indian followed by cursing everyone, and was edit-warring with everyone, and when BBBAAACCC got blocked, an IP (212.174.135.194) from Turkey (a country next to Greece) began revert-warring in order to keep BBBAAACCC's version of pages.
As noted by User:UzEE in the above 2007 report, (SMS) connects himself with Pakistan military. I've noticed that many banned socks have been behaving exactly like SMS and uploading copyrighted images (without permission) relating Pakistan's military, see . According to this recent revert by SMS, he exposed himself that he belongs to a special community within the Hindkowan group, they generally don't associate Pashtuns, and I notice this in SMS's actions. 
He often uses Islamabad IPs to edit, see , , and  and makes other edits by his other socks (User:TopGun  User:MHDH ) so nobody notices but I do because I get paid for doing this )
BBBAAACCC + SMS + TopGun + Ironboy11 + proxies + Islamabad IPs all relate to banned editor , this light-skinned Pakistani guy, the 'Grand Sockmaster' and mass copyright infringer. Clear Proof: 1 2, 3. He often appeared at Siddiqui article since December 2005, used to edit from USA but now from Islamabad.

"Some Small Fixes
I have tried to give the article some balance. Bacque was actually an accomplished writer in Canada before Other Losses, but it is important to point out Other Losses was his first foray into history.
I think it's important to point out Bacque is talking about losses among German POWs held by the Western Allies. Certainly hundreds of thousands, and perhaps more that a million, German POWs died in Allied custody if the Soviet Union is included among the Allies. As well, tens of thousands of German civilians died in Soviet forced-labour crews.
Bacque does make a contribution, albeit flawed, to the historiography, one that has been built upon recently by Anthony Beevor and others, who have looked at the immediate post-war period, the state of Europe before the Marshall Plan, the European reconstruction period, the founding of the ECSC and the beginning of the Cold War.
I am not familiar enough with Bacque's books, especially the second one, to accurately describe them. I think someone who has read them carefully should, at least, give a bare outline of his argument before rejecting them out of hand.
I don't know why Holocaust deniers would embrace Bacque's work, since any neglect of Germans held as POWs by the Western allies does not negate the genocide against the Jews and other Nazi victims.

""""Self-hating Jew"""" is with very rare exception used as an epithet only. It is very rarely used to legitimately describe an actual condition.

Hopefully I can find an admin who appreciates the very simple basic expectations that the community puts upon them. If you find long posts hard to read and evidently not worth putting any great thought into, certainly not enough to actually answer any of the points at all (and if anything you only seem moved to respond because I simply noted how long it took you to review) then perhaps you should reconsider whether you've chosen the best area to spend your time volunteering here. I see from your first failed Rfa, and even from your second successful one, that I'm not the only person to wonder if your attitude towards others is fitting for the responsibility for adminship. I also appear to have erred in assuming ErrantX was a long-serving admin, he was only given the bit in February, and people were clearly concerned at his apparent interest in being an admin for being an admins sake. If you both act like this as a norm in your admin activities, then you guys should be very grateful that recall is one of the most broken aspects of Wikipedia. Still, that's definitely a subject for arbcom, and arbcom alone.

"The Kurdish peoples article has the same problem with this one. Just because a few historians in the past suggest does not mean they are making assertions. Hence trying to get away with naming the rare historians and saying belive. Dozens of scholarly texts I've ever read and perhaps hundreds assert that the medes have no direct cultural/lineage to any modern day people. It may only be surmised (since no large migrations of peoples took place) that the mede genetic make up is mixed with the peoples of the core population in the Zagroas mountains(though still only a weak amalgamation) and then diffuses out to the peoples in the surrounding area, this includes the kurds but is not limited too them. The medes are very obscure historically and they only had conquered a small area of modern day Kurdistan (the people of that area then were considered foreign to the medes no doubt) for a short period before Elam change all that. Not even Iran can claim the Medes as their own. I believe the mede-kurd supposition is an exaggerated chauvinist connection with no genuine historical, archeological, or paleoanthropological support.

At the very least, there are many sources that study the reflectance spectra of Munsell chips. One that is in the public domain is at . The server was awfully slow when I tried to access the links with the ASCII data files; I had better luck with ; click the squares for reflectance data. This website is cited in, for instance,

One of the classic sources—also cited in the paper above—seems to be

Kenneth L. Kelly, Kasson S. Gibson, and Dorothy Nickerson, """"Tristimulus specifications of the Munsell book of color from spectrophotometric measurements,"""" J. Opt. Soc. Am. 33, 355-376 (1943) (abstract: ).

Incidentally, I now realize that these sources may give enough information to settle the very question I posed. But to really settle it, I would first need the answer to the following: was I wrong in the identification of the Munsell's color in my initial posting? That is,

What is the identity—in the Munsell system—of the Munsell color to which the Wikipedia article is referring? Is it in fact 5RP 5/12?

Having realized my probable mistake above, now I don't understand something else. Look at this statement in the article:
…professional artists, following Munsell color system… regard purple as being synonymous with the red-violet color shown at right, in order to clearly distinguish purple from violet…
In what sense are artists supposed to be """"following Munsell"""" here? Obviously not in nomenclature. Is it the case that the artists do use Munsell's colors in their work, but change the names (e.g. Munsell's purple → artist's violet, and Munsell's red-purple → artist's purple)?

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

Justin Vaisse's opinion
This relative absence of French-American political and social unity helps to explain anti-French sentiment in the United States. French historian Justin Vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward France in the United States is the small number of Americans of direct French descent1. http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=12&id;=228&content;=synopsis. While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, """"A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon? The Washington Post's Coverage of France"""", French Politics, Culture & Society, vol. 21, no. 2, summer 2003.
 Just to answer, I've read before that the proportion of french descendant in the US is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the New World at the same time as the Brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly, they were mixed into the mainstream america. However it's true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they don't represent or try to represent.  """,0

 From Loomis 

I guess I just missed your question. I rarely if ever ignore the challenge of an intelligent question. In fact, I'm sure you've noticed in my posts that I tend to repeat my philosophy over and over (perhaps too much!). I strongly believe in what's called the Socratic Method. By that I mean that I believe that the best way at arriving at (something at least close to) the truth is by asking questions, rather than stating opinions. 

Unless a question is completely insulting or moronic, I consider it a challenge to answer it. If I can't answer it properly, I force myself to rethink the matter.

Your question was a good one, and it may take a bit of research on my part because, while I do believe I have a good deal of knowledge on the subject, you've touched on a couple of details I wasn't completely familiar with. Maybe I was just being lazy by overlooking your question. Or maybe it was because I just felt the rest of you guys have had enough of my opinionated and controversial posts, that I thought I should just leave it alone, and give you guys a break.

In any case, I'll definitely give it some good thought and I promise to get back to you, ok! (Don't worry, don't feel like you're giving me """"extra work"""". I'm actually flattered that you'd be interested in my response! I'll be more than glad to develop an answer, especially knowing that someone is actually interested in it!)

I just have a few questions for you. I'm just curious about a few things. For one, I'm very curious about the name """"Evilbu"""". Does it mean something in Flemish? (Is the """"Flemish language"""" really any different from Dutch? I speak French and when I visited Belgium, their French was completely comprehensible, with the exception of a few odd words like """"septant"""" rather than """"soixant-dix"""" for """"seventy"""", etc). Also, you said something about you """"being too young"""". You don't have to answer any of these questions, I respect privacy. But if you don't mind, how old are you? Finally, you say you're """"not a Zionist"""". That can mean one of two different things. One is that you're simply not a Zionist the same way as I'm simply not a Belgian. I've got nothing against Belgians, I'm just not Belgian. Similarly, you could have just been saying that you're simply not a Zionist. You've got nothing against Zionism, you just simply aren't one. Of course it could also mean something very different. It could mean that you're against Zionism.

But that's ok too. I'm sure you know this, but the Jewish religion is a non-proselytizing religion. What that means is that we don't go around knocking on people's doors trying to convince them to become Jewish. In fact, we don't even find it necessary to explain or rationalize our faith to others. What we believe is what we believe, and what you believe is what you believe. No need to """"sell"""" our religion to anyone else.

The reason why I'm bringing this up is because unlike Judaism, Zionism, to a certain extent, has to be explained, clarified and rationalized to others. So what I'm saying is that while I won't even bother explaining Judaism (unless of course you're curious, and even then, it would be in a totally """"interfaith"""" manner, respecting whatever you are and not trying to change it,) I believe it's my duty as a Zionist and as a Jew to help you to understand why we, as Jews, believe so dearly, that it is so incredibly important that we have a homeland, a safe haven.

Boy, this is the most understated thing I've read here on Wikipedia.  While the current details about ZCMI are pretty good, and the list of stores when the chain wwas closed down is pretty accurate, it is hardly an exaustive list of stores that have been in existance.  Virtually every Mormon community had a version of ZCMI at one time or another, and some decidedly non-Mormon communities as well.  The most remarkable being a ZCMI set up in Rapid City, South Dakota.

In addition, a huge part of the history of ZCMI is tied directly with the history of Utah, including the petition for Utah statehood and the fight between the """"Mormons"""" and the """"Gentiles"""" during the territorial days of Utah.  Part of this history should include how members of the LDS Church would face excommunication if they shopped anywhere except at ZCMI.  I am not kidding here.  Several LDS Church members were removed from the church rolls because of this seemingly irrational justification (based on modern sentiments).  Keep in mind that there was a coordinated economic plan to try and push the non-Mormons out of Mormon influenced areas, and this is really in keeping with other business traditions of 19th Century America as well, including Standard Oil and others that would be illegal with current fair trade laws.

Saying that the LDS Church was a significant influences is hardly doing justice here.  The LDS Church owned the store lock, stock, and barrel.  And the decision to sell ZCMI to May department stores was mainly a way for the LDS Church to get out of that sort of business.  What is surprising is that is was a subsiderary of the LDS Church for so long, making it into the 21st Century.  The LDS Church has divested itself from other businesses it started back elsewhen like a Sugar Company and a chain of Hospitals, and in that context ZCMI is just one of several aspects of life in Utah.

An event horizon is any surface from beyond which no information can ever reach the observer.  Of course, that includes objects of all kinds - in fact, anything moving at or below the speed of light - so in a sense you're right.  An important thing to note though is that the event horizon - in the strictest sense - belongs to the observer, rather than the thing (not) being observed.  In the case of a black hole, the event horizon is the same for all outside observers, which I guess is what you mean by a 'physical boundary'.  The Event horizon article is biased towards this, the most commonly encountered form of event horizon.  The cosmological event horizon is different: since every point in the Universe is receding from every other point with a speed proportional to distance, the event horizon is always a sphere centred on a particular observer, so there is no single 'event horizon of the Universe' (although of course we tend to give a special place to our own event horizon).

So neither article is wrong, although the introduction to Event horizon gives a misleadingly narrow interpretation of the term, which I'll try to fix.  The cosmological use is however mentioned in Event horizon#Event horizon of the observable universe.  There are more details in Cosmological horizon and Particle horizon.

Well, in general, using examples from other articles will not be helpful, because there is a lack of consistency.  In fact, the article about Kodokan Judo is currently at Kodokan, and Itto-ryu is currently at Ittō-ryū.  Please be aware of the difference, though, between arts where the name of the martial art practiced (such as """"judo"""" or """"kenjutsu"""") is a part of the name of the school, and where it is just describing the school.  If it is part of the school's """"official"""" name, it should be capitalized, and be included in the name of the article.  If it is not part of the school's official name, it should not even be part of the article's title, much less capitalized. Thus, I believe (and I could be mistaken) that Kodokan should actually be moved to Kodokan Judo, while Ittō-ryū should stay where it is.  A good rule of thumb might be, if you were to go to Japan, and look at the sign hanging over the front door, what would it say.  I suppose Itto-ryu might included """"Kenjutsu"""" after it, but certainly any of the comprehensive koryu would have only the name of the school.  Daito-ryu, on the other hand, seems to clearly use """"Aikijujutsu"""" as part of its name.  There's even a great old photo of Morihei Ueshiba from the 1930s, sitting in seiza in front of a sword stand and a hanging banner that reads (in kanji, of course) """"Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu"""".

Regarding the hyphen in """"aiki-jujutsu"""", I may have actually been the one to add that originally.  It's purely a personal preference issue.  There are no rules regarding hyphens in Hepburn romanization, their use is up to the judgment of the writer to include them wherever they help to improve clarity.  I felt that an English-speaking reader with no Japanese experience might have a hard time with """"aikijujutsu"""", because all of the repetitive vowels kind of make the word blur together, and it is a logical place to break the word up, without making it look like two entirely separate words. Or putting it another way, it makes """"aikijujutsu"""" readily identifiable as a compound word, and clearly shows the two root words.  I am not at all attached to doing it this way, though, and would have no problem with them all being changed back to """"aikijujutsu"""", if anyone feels strongly about it.  """,0

"So we shouldn't add important information just because some people don't know what it means?  Wouldn't it be simpler to explain what it means and why it's important to their favorite TV show - since it is the most important factor to whether a show stays on the air or not (demo ratings indicate what portion of adults 18-49, the segment of the population most desired by advertisers, watch a particular episode.  The higher the number, the more a network can charge for advertising, ergo the more successful a show is.  There, that wasn't too tough, was it?)?  
Reporting irrelevant information (like total viewers  many shows with large viewerships get cancelled if their demo ratings are too low, i.e. below a 2) just because it's easy to understand doesn't seem like a valid reason for listing some information and not others.  Ratings are reported by every major news media, even US Today reports the 18-49 rating, so obviously many do know what it means.   Not including the demo 18-49 ratings in an entry about a TV show is like listing baseball games without the score.
As for where to put it, at one point the demo rating shared a box with total viewership in the episode listing  either put it back there or create a new box in the episode listing grid for the demo rating.  Doesn't seem like a big deal to add it.",0

 Khwarizmi being Persian: Original research, which has nothing to do with Wikipedia 

Let's look into the Persians' claims, shall we?

Zmmz lists Merriam-Webster with this quote: """"Function: biographical name circa 780-circa 850 Muhammad ibn MusA al-KhwArizmI Islamic (Persian-born) mathematician & astronomer; one of the greatest scientific minds of Islam; source of much of mathematical knowledge of medieval Europe"""".

 Notice, it says """"Persian-born"""" in parantheses, and gives Islamic as the nationality. Basically, they defined him by religion and stated his place of birth. He was born in Khwarizm, in the Khorasan province. At the time of his birth, it was part of the Arab Islamic Caliphate, now it's part of the Uzbegistan nation-state. Alas, Persians burnt us saying that it's in fact Persian, so let's take it as Persian. Now, according to sources cited by Heja Helwada, Khorasan in general had a huge Arab population. In accordance to that, defining him as Persian simply because he was born in Khorasan, is not only disputed at best, it also constitutes OR(original research) which is against Wiki's policy, see: WP:NOR

A troll showed up lately and claimed that Arabs are fighting a losing battle, I'm not sure we're in a battle-field here, but I got the gist: he thinks we have no sources...poor little guy!

Oh lord, spare us. Your side makes out that it's just a slur aimed at the Israeli government, and then you complain that it's also used for other Zionists! Lots of people call expansionists """"Zionists"""", not just neo-Nazis and """"Islamists"""", although they are well represented as doing so on Google. And few people would use the phrase """"Zionist terrorists"""" who aren't so describing the government and armed forces of Israel (and it's true that the combination is unlikely to be much seen in mainstream work, because it's rare that governments of any kind are described as """"terrorists"""" in mainstream publications).

My advice to Sensei48 is to form a skirmish line, and hold that position. Do not retreat to the timber. Neither should he order a “charge to the rear”: that way disaster lies. 

I include the rousing “Notre Dame Victory March” to help inspire you to defend your remarks of  May 5, 2011:

Rally sons of Notre Dame
Sing her glory, and sound her fame
Raise her Gold and Blue,
And cheer with voices true,
Rah! Rah! For Notre Dame. 
We will fight in every game
Strong of heart and true to her name.
We will ne'er forget her
And we'll cheer her ever,
Loyal to Notre Dame.
Chorus:
Cheer, cheer for Old Notre Dame
Wake up the echoes cheering her name,
Send the volley cheer on high,
Shake down the thunder from the sky,
What though the odds be great or small
Old Notre Dame will win over all,
While her loyal sons are marching
Onward to Victory.

"About so called caste formation in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It is not a separate process, most sociologists and linguist call the shared cultural region as Tamilakam. In Wiki we have to rewrite the article to reflect this reality. If you read the Kerala and Malayalam entries, and www.kerlahistory.com site this new idea is brought out. Hence Kerala and Tamil Nadu are hitched at the hips up-until the 10 century regarding their cultural development. 

Caste itself is not a proper word to describe the social condition of South Asia. What is more accurate is Jati and Varna.  According to linguists like Proff Hart of Berkeley and others, indigenous societies specifically in South India there already were societal cleavage based on certain lineages that were slowly cornering certain economic productive mechanisms such as cultivation, fishing, security, drumming, bards etc. This was in response to a move away from hunter gatherers to slash and burn to settled agriculture and cattle herding. 

The Sangam literature which is a kaleidoscope of the social conditions prevalent in ancient Cera, Chola and Pandya countries describes a situation where there was a lot of flux and violence used to maintain the economic advantages. In this milieu the northern ideas and people were also added their system such as the Varna. But in reality what the Brahmins  did was to become just another Jati to fit the local model already prevailing and added religious sanction on top of the violence that is needed to maintain the Jati system . Thus  Brahminism, Jainism and Buddhism were  very important in pacifying the populace that lead to the development of later great empires. 

The word Pulaiti and Pulayan are used in Sangam literature to describe people serving chiefs. They were attached to the wealthy because apparently they were dispossessed or had nothing to independably live on. The name of the Kannadiga caste is Holeya. Where Hole in archaic Kannada means menstrual blood thus indicating that even before Tamil and Kannada became independent certain lineages may have become debased. As you know that’s a long time ago:)) 

Why is ancient Tamilakam important as opposed to rest of India to understand the unique caste system. Because it was the last frontier to succumb to Indo Aryan population and cultural advance into South Asia. Further it maintained its cultural independence just enough to record (via the Sangam literature) the prevailing conditions before culturally becoming part of rest of India after the Bhakthi period. Today so called separate Keralite and Tamil cultures are just another appendages of a greater Indian culture with minor regional variations.",0

""""Not my business to go and unearth the original source documents.""""  If you read widely enough instead of relying on large overview sources and have more than a superficial interest in the subject, sooner or later you might """"unearth"""" the original documents, which are surprisingly easy to come by.  A large portion of the naval history books I have listed in my library came off the internet for nothing, and if you're lucky you'll find books which quote documents verbatim.  Last weekend I had the great pleasure to take advantage of a incompetent error made by the National Archives and was able to download a few dozen service records for free, instead of the hundreds of pounds of the five hundred pounds/thousand dollars plus I would normally have had to pay.  Already I have seen where certain historians (Gordon in The Rules of the Game is one) have obviously not checked the service record and made false assertions about certain officers, and also where they have cited the service record yet written something entirely different.

Marder is interesting because in his twenties he was possibly the last person to look at a great deal of Admiralty literature.  It's bad enough that in many cases he doesn't cite specifically the details of the correspondence involved, but it really didn't help that the Naval Historical Section literally purged untold numbers of documents, a process which was finally halted in the late fifties.  Therefore quite literally a lot of Marder's scholarship depends on his reputation and not the facts.  (talk |  | ) """,0

 """"JFK:First Day Evidence"""" 

I looked for information on a book called """"First Day Evidence"""" written by Gary Savage.   Several book reviews noted the following

Mr. Savage is the nephew of a retired member of  Dallas police crime lab who  processed much of the evidence gathered the day of the JFK assassination, Nov. 22, 1963.  Savage located a number of documents and photographs, previously not published that were in official Dallas police files or the personal files of retired police officers.  """"JFK:First Day Evidence"""" consists of those documents and photographs with commentary on the investigative activities of the Dallas police on the day of and shortly after the assassination.  

This book appears to contain good evidence during the critical period.

I am looking forward to reading it.

Cadfael said Columbanus did not need the poppy syrup on this trip, and Cadfael thought the events of that day cast doubt on Jerome as the murderer, not Columbanus  until his realization that Jerome did not sleep on purpose.  Now Cadfael cast his doubts on Columbanus.  Cast doubts, not provided alibis.  

The brothers have no private property, so he can search the scrip any time.  Peredur's mother is a minor plot device so he does search; the main point is the discovery and Cadfael's new view of that day. 
Perhaps you could provide the text quotes for your changes, next time.

Quotes from the text of A Morbid Taste for Bones

Jerome lacks an alibi, rather than providing one for Columbanus in Chapter Six
""""Father, you sent me with Brother Jerome, yesterday, to keep vigil in the chapel, and pray earnestly for a good outcome, in amity and peace. Father, we came there in good time, before eleven, as I judge, and having eaten our meal, we went in and took our places, for there are prayer-desks within, and the altar is kept clean and well-tended. Oh, Father, my will to keep vigil was good, but the flesh was weak. I had not been half an hour kneeling in prayer, when I fell asleep on my arms on the desk, to my endless shame. It is no excuse that I have slept badly and thought much since we came here. Prayer should fix and purify the mind. I slept, and our cause was weakened. I must have slept all the afternoon, for the next thing I remember is Brother Jerome shaking me by the shoulder and telling me there was a messenger calling us to go with him.""""

He caught his breath, and a frantic tear rolled down his cheek, circling the bold, rounded Norman bone. """"Oh, do not look askance at Brother Jerome, for he surely never knew I had been sleeping, and there is no blame at all to him for not observing and reporting my sin. I awoke as he touched me, and arose and went with him. He thought me as earnest in prayer as he, and knew no wrong.""""
Nobody, probably, had thought of looking askance at Brother Jerome until then, but Cadfael was probably the quickest and most alert, and the only one who caught the curious expression of apprehension, fading rapidly into complacency, that passed over Brother Jerome's normally controlled countenance. Jerome had not been pursuing the same studies as Cadfael, or he would have been far from complacent. For Brother Columbanus in his self-absorbed innocence had just removed all certainty that Jerome had spent the previous noon and afternoon motionless in Saint Winifred's chapel, praying for a happy solution. His only guarantor had been fast asleep throughout. He could have sauntered out and gone anywhere he chose.

Cadfael speaking to Peredur in Chapter Nine
""""Never mind, you can show me where they lodge. Columbanus brought some of my poppy syrup with him, in case of need, the phial should be there with his scrip, he'd hardly have it on him. And as far as I know, he's had no occasion to use it, his cantrips here in Wales have been of a quieter kind. We can find a use for it now.""""

 Korean article template 

Hi, thanks for your question.  Sorry I'm so late getting back to you.  Life on and off Wikipedia has been full of all sorts of unexpected hecticity...  Anyway, the Korean article template. 

The idea behind the template is pretty simple.  The basic idea is that every article should have the following, unless there is some reason to the contrary:
 a relevant """"See also"""" section, 
 at least one relevant Korea-related category, and
 a name table.  
 Template:Korean on the Talk page.

In more detail...
The """"See also"""" section should include a link to the List of Korea-related topics  (LKRT), and anything else that's obviously relevant but not linked in the article text.  If you prefer, you can just put in the LKRT link and let someone else add the others.  If you want to add more, here's the rule I've been following:  look in each category of which the article is a member.  If that category has a main article (like Korea in Category:Korea), then that main article should be linked  either from the text, or from the See also section.  The same for parent categories, within reason.  Here's an example:  Munmu of Silla is a member of the categories Silla and Korean rulers.  Thus, the articles Silla and Rulers of Korea are linked in the article text.  Those two categories are part of Category:Korean history and Category:Korean people.  Thus, History of Korea is linked in the See also section, and so is List of Koreans (well, it is now).   Both of those are members of Category:Korea, hence the link to the LKRT.  
You can find a complete (?) list of Korea-related categories at List of Korea-related topics#Categories.  Or just start at Category:Korea and work your way down.
Template:Koreanname noimage is fine for the vast majority of articles.  Cut and paste Template talk:Koreanname noimage#Syntax and fill in the blanks.  All Korean name tables require you to specify at least these four variables: hangul, hanja, rr, and mr.  """"Rr"""" stands for Revised Romanization of Korean, and """"mr"""" stands for McCune-Reischauer Romanization.  If you don't know what should go in these fields, just leave them blank  however, at a minimum the hangul should be provided (that allows other editors to verify the article and identify the other name-related information).  You can request help on the Korea-related notice board.  
This one's easy.  Just paste {{Korean}} onto the top of the talk page.  Done!

Most of our existing articles should already conform to this, since we just finished a housekeeping sweep in June.  But there are more new ones coming in every day...

I've also taken to adding a """"Wish list"""" to the talk pages of new/inactive articles, identifying 2 or 3 things that the article is lacking.  Hopefully this will help other contributors see where they can help.   (Of course, if I can contribute the information myself, I do so).

I hope this isn't all too overwhelming.  Your excellent work so far is much appreciated. 

Cheers,

Julien, there always exist contrary points of view. People still take issue with the Earth being round. But while one can have a contrary opinion, that doesn't make said opinion a fact.

Also it would have to be paired with fact that the specimen (almost exclusively associated with Y-DNA R1a1) from South Siberia and Kazakhstan (*) had almost exclusively mtDNA haplogroups of west eurasian/european origin especially during bronze age (as far as 1,800 BC).

Especially since no south Asian haplogroups are linked to the spread of R1a1, up to Europe.

Pretty meaningful, especially since such phenotypes are found where high frequency of R1a1 are found in Asia (like 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, east Afghanistan and north Pakistan) -> examples of such clearly europoid phenotypes in these regions of Asia that matches the description of south Siberian of Bronze age (andronovo culture horizon),

First, you are misreading what your first source is. The document you reference is a UN interum report on Resolution 425. 425 dates back to 1978. That document (the report) does not reflect any agreement between the UN and Israel. 425 calls for many things, but there had been no public pledge from Israel on dismantling the SLA. In fact, Israel in public had been saying the opposite. They were not planning to leave until early July. The report being issued on the 22nd isn't very meaningful. Its coincidence. There was a whole series of meetings between the SLA (see later material) and UN/various countries that was a whole lot more damaging than the interium erport on 425.

Second, I think its better to deal with Charbel Barakat's fuller and more accurate version of what happened in May from his congressional testimony in June 2000:

""""During the month of May 2000 our people remitted a memorandum to the office of the United Nations in Nakura in south Lebanon offering suggestions to avoid bloodshed and exodus. During the same month delegations representing our community met with diplomats of the US, UK, and French embassies in Israel and at the United Nations. And on May 18, our representatives met with the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York ... Instead of taking our demands for protection on our land seriously, the United Nations declined to assist us ... The United States, UK and France dismissed our fears and insisted on guarantees which were allegedly granted by the Beirut regime ... The State of Israel only prepared for our potential exodus, ruling out our determination to remain on our land and defend ourselves.""""

""""Despite the abandonment by the international community and against all odds, our people decided to remain and fight for their land and rights while calling endlessly on the UN to deploy its units around our villages. 
On May 22, 2000, and as Israeli units were implementing their own withdrawal and the commander of the SLA was absent in France, the mostly Shiite sector of the security zone collapsed. It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave before the borders closed. Even after the invasion of Hizbollah of this area, the mostly Christian-Druse eastern enclave and the Christian western enclave, decided to defend themselves and protect their citizens after Israel’s withdrawal.
On May 23, 2000, at 8 PM, SLA officers in the western sector received orders from the Israelis to leave their posts as Hizbollah was advancing towards their villages. Thus the SLA was imploded from the inside and was dismantled without any battle. The main reason why the SLA did not remain and fight was the fact that the border was closed behind its back. Without access to medical and logistical supplies, our people was condemned either to surrender to its enemy or flee across the border."""" (from [www.10452lccc.com/special%20studies/barakatjune2000.htm])

The SLA did collapse. What Charbel Barakat is talking about in the MEF comments is that the remainder of the SLA (Christian) in the west did not collapse and was dismanted by Israel. But it was only dismanted after most of the SLA had collapsed. Charbel Barakat and other dead-enders may have wanted (in theory anyway) to fight on in the west, but Israel wasn't going to make any commitment to keep a miniture version of the SLA going in a tiny pocket on the west end of the border. The caution I would give about Barakat and a couple others from the SLA is that sometimes they think of their Christian portion of the SLA as if it were the entire SLA. And from that point of view, the SLA did not collapse and was dismantled by Israel.

The biggest claim made by Barakat is in weasel-words: """"It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave"""". 'It appeared that"""" means he is guessing. Nobody on either side of the border has outright claimed that the Shites were told to leave and that is why they collapsed on the 22nd. Even Barakat is unwilling to make that claim.

Now lots of other things may have happened that the public doesn't know about with regard to the SLA collapse. But the only people who would know the truth are a handful of people at the top of the Israeli government and army. Nobody in the SLA knows much of anything because if Israel was going to collapse them, they would hardly tell them their plan. People (including me) can make lots of hunches and theories about what might have happened, but there are no facts to back any of those theories up.  """,0

Saedon,

As you know, or at least should know, peer-review has become a very politicized process, not just for I.D., but for all non-mainstream scientific views. Casey Luskin has an excellent articleoutstanding article, heavily burrowed from a paper by physicist Frank Tipler, which details this, including direct quotes from multiple Nobel Prize winners on the deep flaws of the peer-review process. Even if the journal's referees, themselves, would be willing to publish pro-I.D. research, the fear of backlash  even boycotts  directed towards both themselves and their journals, surely prevents them from doing so.

You must understand, when dealing with intelligent design, we're dealing with something that causes nothing less than embarrassing, childish, outrageous, emotional outbursts from its detractors, including many scientists (the Bloggingheads incident comes to mind, where many scientists attempted to boycott Bloggingheads simply because they allowed Michael Behe on to discuss his views). These detractors, of course, include many Wikipedia contributors. I strongly suspect that includes you, which is I why you make such a suspect editor regarding this subject, and why none of my words, as reasonable as they may be, will have any effect on dogmatic thinking.

With all of this said, the Discovery Institute keeps a page archiving the many pro-I.D. articles which have been able to penetrate the politicized wall of orthodoxy that has sullied the peer-review process. The number is currently over 50, and continually growing.

Of course, once the objection that I.D. has no peer-reviewed publications in support of it has been met, the goalposts will be moved to the claim that, (a) they're not good enough, (b) there's not enough, or (c) a combination of a and b. Casey Luskin, again, has fantastic article, entitled """"Answering Objections about Discovery Institute's Peer-Review Page,"""" that addresses some of these goalpost shifts (this is the part where you ignore the arguments and attack Casey Luskin the person).

Let me also add that every paper which further unveils a level of sophistication in the cell, more design principles, function for something once thought to be junk, etc., weighs support to the notion that life was designed, and that the Darwinian view is based on ignorance. A couple of articles which come to mind are James A. Shapiro's Natural Genetic Engineering, which shows that evolution is the programmed result of the brilliantly designed technology located inside the cell, and Michael Sherman's Universal Genome theory, a view which demonstrates that evolution was a front-loaded event (read: evolution was programmed).""",0

Wow!  I just saw tonight's news article on Wikipedia that played on FOX News.  (Earlier, I'd posted here the AP article on Wikipedia from Dec 12, 2005.)

In what has become a huge coincidence, the very day the media begins reporting on the dangers of Wikipedia, happens to be the day immediately after the very week I discovered misinformation and falsehoods being posted on this page about nitrites, and then tried to edit them by attempting to add more accurate information, but then was attacked and harassed by another person who disagrees with my edits  and was ultimately blocked and threatened by a purported Wikipedia administrator.

As was reported in the news today, people can go to http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/ to learn more about how Wikipedia functions, and where the dangers exist.

The folks at wikipediawatch report that, what's happening in Wikipedia, is that any collection of citations that may APPEAR balanced is all that anybody expects. If the title or snippet in a link itself contributes to this impression, then the full text is not researched by anyone.

This is exactly what has been going on in this nitrite page.  As a result, it truly is, as wikipediawatch reminds us, """"garbage in, garbage out, garbage back in...""""  and after a few cycles of this, it all turns into """" a big, stinking heap"""".

Truly, as the news media warned today: """"Don't believe eveyrthing you read on the Web, especially on Wikipedia!""""

The following two posts, found in a wikipediareview blog, sum up my experiences this past week, after having been harassed, threatened and finally blocked, after I attempted to add to the body of knowledge about nitrites/poppers.  They demonstrate how dangerous Wikipedia  based on its current model  really is:

""""Wikipedia's procedural faults, complete anarchy as regards contributions, and sometimes-bizzare social rules do not teach people to become good researchers or writers... it teaches them how to be good Wikipedians, or to get the hell out."""" - Jason Scott
"""". . . when it comes to history and politics, Wikipedia can claim whatever it wants by shutting out those who actually know something about a certain topic. In that way, Wikipedia can rewrite history as it sees fit - which may have nothing to do with reality or the actual facts."""" - SummerFR

Finally, this post on a board, discussing wikipedia, really sets it out well:

""""Any moron can pretty well say anything they want on any topic, which is fine for a News Group or a Forum but not an Encyclopedia.

In my opinion a reference source should be authoritative enough to end arguments not start them.

I believe that Wikipedia could better serve the internet community if they checked their facts first before publishing the article.

Instead, we have a situation where the cart is placed before the horse and we end up with what is left by the horse.""""

The only vandal here is you. Let me clefify some things 4 you,

In the 19th century Ilija Garasanin and the rest of the Serb goverment of that time formed a program called """"Nacertanije"""", it was a plan of how to realize the plan of a Great Serbia  on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. This new state would be rulled by Serbs, others would be subjected while Muslims(of any ethnicity) would be distroyed(by genocide sense it´s the only way). They called there Army chetnik, them selfs chetniks and there by this ideology(which is fashist) is chetnik. And any1 who follows it is a chetnik.

The plan failed untill 1918 when the Serbs managed to create a """"Slavic Kingdom"""" which was actually ment to become a Serb Kingdom which was with time shown, during WWII the chetniks allied with the Nazis and commited GENOCIDE. After the death of Tito the chetniks ressurected and tried everyting all over again but ones again failed thank God.

Now, the chetnik PROPAGANDA is used to make Serbs think that it is right to do all that and to foole everybothy else, this propaganda includes showing Bosnia as a """"Serb state"""", Bosniaks as  """"Serbs"""", spreding Islamophobia and Anti-Bosniak settlment or presenting the Serbs as the victoms and so on. THAT site does all that and it is enough to open it and you will see. Now you ain´t nobody so I don´t have to proove anything if you don´t see it then you are either stupid or a chetnik your self.

"Bakan 

Why is Abbie Bakan even mentioned in this article?  Based on the worthless rag of hers which is cited as a source in this article, she's nothing but a shill for Lenin and the rest of the commie gang.  In that rag, she not only shows egregious pro-Communist bias, but doesn't even bother to check the facts, much less look at the causes of the Kronstadt rebellion or even cite reliable historical sources on that subject.  She also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a White conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by anti-semitic racism among the sailors.  Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified.  Last but not least, the mere fact that the aforementioned rag was first published by a self-admitted socialist party by definition means that this source DOES NOT meet EITHER WP:NPOV OR WP:RS.

What has been on the news this last month has been that sectors of the commuter network (the suburban train network) are being closed to convert them to the high speed network which will connect to guadalajara, im actually a bit confused and frustrated about this myself. And about the Priesmangoode design, what happened is Siemens original tender in the competition was the Velero, however it was given little interest due to lobbying by the Japanese with the E5 which at that point seemed like it would for sure become the winner. And Priestmangoode is only a designer so the need an actual manufacturing firm if they want their concept to come to life. They tried to interest other firms in Britain with the design but that didnt go anywhere. The Mexican transportaion secretary had already stated in the very beginging that a double decker system was preferable and since Siemens Velaro was pretty much already out of the compettition Siemens took back it's tender. Siemens then jointly (with priesmangoode) presented the concept to the Mexican transportation secretary that it could jointly manufacture the double decked Mercury design. But what really is the main aspect of why Siemens bid will probably win is because they are wiling to have the rolling stock fully manufactured in Mexico. This was in the July 2008 issue of Ferrocarril. In the end no real progress was really made in the final selection because then the Japanese and the French gave the same offer of manufacuring the trains in Mexico after Siemens came up with the concept so we still have to wait till 2011 to find out who wins / 69.235.193.67",0

The """"British monarchy"""" is """"first among equals"""" in political terms as the abolition of the monarchy in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc would have no impact on the monarchy in Britain whereas the abolition of the monarchy in the UK would almost certainly lead to its extinction in the rest of the Commonwealth Realms.

The fact is that the system in the """"Commonwealth Realms"""" (outside of the UK) was designed with the assumption that the monarch would be resident in London. Do you deny that?TAB

The fact is that the monarch is present most of the time in Britain. She has spent 2% of her reign in Canada and, I suspect, around that percentage or less in the other Commonwealth Realms.TAB

The fact is that this means there is quite a different relationship between the monarch and a) her British subjects and the British political system and b) her subjects and the political systems in the other Commonwealth realms.

The most obvious constitutional difference is that the duties and constitutional role played by the Governor General in the Commonwealth Realms is played by the Queen herself in Britain. i.e. The Queen, with increasingly rare exceptions, does not give royal assent to bills passed in Commonwealth legislatures or even give the Throne Speech (what in Britain is called the Queen's Speech because the Queen herself gives it). She does not name the Prime Ministers in Commonwealth Realms, does not resolve constitutional or parliamentary crises that may result in Commonwealth Realms and does not have weekly meetings with her Commonwealth PMs.TAB

Now monarchists like to believe that the Queen is fully informed and intimately involved in, let's say, Canadian affairs. The reality is that in the Commonwealth Realms the role of the monarchy has developed so that it is really more of an abstract and theoretical entity, much more so than in Britain.TAB

Let me give you a hard example. We now know that the Queen was not at all consulted on the dismissal of Gough Whitlam in Australia in 1975. This was done by Governor General Kerr in her name but she was not consulted or even informed until after it had happened.TAB

Let me give you another example. We now know thanks to the 30 year disclosure rule that the Prince Philip and the Prince of Wales quite regularly write letters and make phone calls to Cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats in Britain complaining of this or that government policy (this is actually quite shocking considering all the propaganda we are fed about the monarchy being """"above politics""""). We also know from biographies and autobiographies that UK Prime Ministers do give some consideration to what the Queen thinks about this or that thing or even this or that minister. It may not be a decisive consideration but its in the picture. That is simply not the case for Commonwealth Realm PMs. There is no evidence of royals writing Canadian or Austrlain ministers complaining about this or that policy or of Canadian or Australian PMs being particularly concerned about what the Queen might think, at least not to the extent as is the case in the UK. TAB

Now you might say but the Governor General acts on HMs behalf so there's really no difference. But there is, the Queen's role in the UK is unmediated, in the realms it is mediated by a GG and she is almost a complete absentee from the process.TAB

Therefore, it's quite clear that her role is much more important in the UK than elsewhere. 

Also, the fact that the systems in the Commonwealth Realms are designed with an absentee monarch in mind and have a GG in place Britain becoming a republic would have an impact on the realms where Commonwealth realms becoming republics has had no impact on the Queen's role in the UK. 

The fact is if Britain became a republic the Commonwealth Realms would have to figure out which one of them would become the new home for the Windsors, or if some sort of shared custody arrangement should be worked out where, say, she spends one month in each realm.TAB

The fact is they would also have to deal with the royal family's wishes, including the possibility that they would not want to move to Canada or Australia but would prefer to either remain in a British republic as ordinary citizens or live in exile in Europe (or even the US). That would raise the possibility of abdication and having to find a new mon",0

"""My decision to pursue graduate study in the United States is underscored by my desire to be a part of the graduate program at your institution. Purdue University offers the flexibility needed for such a vast and rapidly changing field. The research facilities and the faculty at the university are par excellent. 

Communications is an industry that has changed our lives. In a very short period it has changed the way we have looked at things since centuries. It is one industry that is going to shape our future for centuries to come. Hence my desire to do masters in electrical engineering with communications as my major. 

My interest in electronics blossomed during my high school years. It was the time when technology had begun to make an impact on the lives of people in India. Hence engineering with electronics as my major was the first choice for my undergraduate studies. Right since the beginning of my undergraduate study electronics is a subject that has fascinated me with its power of applications. The subjects that I have studied include Linear Electronics, Digital Electronics. These laid the foundation for my courses in Electronic Communication & Communication Systems at a later stage. My undergraduate studies already focus on the communications aspect of electronics. A masters degree in electrical engineering with communications as major field is the next logical step. 

For the past four months I have been working as a project trainee at the Indian Institute for Advanced Electronics. I am working on the design and development of a """"PC Controlled Digital Serial Data Generator"""". This short stint has given me invaluable practical experience. It has given me the confidence to pursue a masters degree and also kindled a desire to do research. 

During the course of my work at IIAE, I have come across several scientists. Most of them work in different areas of communications. Interactions with them have made me realize the vastness and the scope of communications. My discussions with them convinced me that specializing in communications will suit me very well. 

The subject of research which interests me very much is spread spectrum communication systems. Coding theory and combinations is another research subject which arouses my curiosity. The subject Communication Theory which I am studying at present introduces these topics in theory. I am eager to find out more about the applications of coding theory to spread spectrum communication systems. 

In addition I have been a student member of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.) for the past three years. Through its workshops/seminars and publications like the 'The Spectrum' it has exposed me to a lot of emerging technologies in the field of communications. 

It is a strong belief in my family that the American education system has the best to offer in the whole world. This belief arises out of the experience that my parents had when they did their Masters of Science in the University of Pennsylvania during the years 1967-69. If I can get an opportunity to be a part of that intellectually stimulating environment, I am sure my talents will be put to optimal use. 

India is a developing country with an enormous potential in the information technology business. To serve the needs of this developing industry and more important its vast population, communications is going to become of utmost importance. Thus conditions here are very conducive to supplement my aspirations when I return after completing my graduate studies.""",0

               Dr.I.K.Gill
       He has devoted his life for the needy
Not long ago Dr.I.K.Gill an expert in psychology and physical education came over to Pakistan from Germany. He held workshops in special education and physical education. Under the leadership of Dr.Gill workshops were held in Karachi as well as in Lahore. In Karachi workshops, teachers from special education institutes attended under his able leadership. Teachers from Punjab and North Frontier Province attended the similar courses in Lahore.
Dr.I.K.Gill taught mental health and physical education for handicapped children. During these workshops he instructed the teachers how to teach children in physical movements so that they are able to lead their lives as normal human beings and they do not remain dependant on others.
Dr.I.K.Gill originally comes from Pakistan. He was born 1924 in a village in Sialkot District. He was born in a poor home therefore he had to labour hard in the fields. However, he was keenly interested in acquiring education. He did his primary schooling in his own village and did his high school graduation at C.T.I. High School, Sialkot. After high school he joined the army and served his country in British India Government.  After release from the army he worked in Government College of Physical Education, Walton. Lahore as a superintendent and teacher.
In 1956 he got a chance to go for higher studies in Germany in a college of physical education along with the university of  Cologne, Germany. After graduation from Germany, he went to the University of Graz, Austria for Ph.D. Having completed his PhD he went back to Germany and worked as a teacher of physical education. During his service he happened to see a photo in a church magazine, which alerted his life profoundly for ever. They were the images of people suffering from leprosy. The moment he saw a fellow countryman, he was shaken through and through. At that moment he decided to go to Pakistan. Within a short time by the Grace of God through the German Leprosy Relief Association he landed in Pakistan with his newly wedded wife.
He started his work in Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre in Karachi (e.g.the Leprosy Colony in a hut behind McLeod Road, later a building was bought in Frere Road in Saddar Bazaar)
From 1962 to 1970 Dr, Gill worked for the welfare of Leprosy patients in Pakistan. 
Dr. Gill said about his mission “I always wanted to know those unfortunate people who are dependant in one way or the other upon others. My ambition was to teach such people to be able to do their own work and lead an independent happy life. Such unfortunate people are victim of unhappiness and misery, therefore my yearning was to help and work for the welfare of such weaker sections of community. So I thought I must involve myself in a difficult mission. For such vital mission I chose to come to my own beloved country Pakistan”. Dr. Gill concentrated his special attention  on backward and handicapped children in Pakistan because  in his opinion today’s child is a responsible citizen, a child is tomorrow`s father being the builder and protector of the next generation. Therefore to educate him or her today is very important. Dr. Gill said that besides food and refuge is necessary for these children but undoubted education most important.  Dr. Gill revealed that he is very surprised to discover that parents of these unfortunate children have no ambition to educate these disadvantaged children. Today children are expected to contribute in the family income and expenditure. Let’s say that handicapped children cannot do so, but if they educated to look after their needs themselves and their person, they do not remain dependant upon others for the whole of their lives. Special education can make life easier and productive.
TABIn view of his services from 1962 -70 Government of Pakistan invited Dr.I.K.Gill to Pakistan. He came back to train teachers of physical and special education, so that these teachers could provide special education to needy children in their respective areas. 
Dr. Gill provided this facility in Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi. He stayed and carried on his services for about eight weeks to complete series of lectures.
He also came back this year again to carry on series of special education training which took place in Lahore and Karachi. He appreciated greatly that three universities accepted the challenge and established the departments of special education. Dr. Gill trained forty teachers both in Lahore and Karachi who would further train teachers in special education. Therefore the number of teachers will be increased. 
Dr. Gill used modern techniques i.e. videos used in Germany, movies, wheelchairs, small sandbags, balloons and many more others. It was shown how",0

P.S. In response to 'canvassing': I think such accusations are, once again, biased. We see users such as Kittybrewster admit to it, but nothing happens, because she is supporting the status quo. Canvassing for the status quo=acceptable. Canvassing for a minority position=unacceptable. This, despite the fact that Wikipedia calls for a pluralistic approach that takes multiple viewpoints into account, unless those views represent an extreme margin. And in this case, Wikipedia may have erred. From BBC to ABC, Cambridge University to UCLA, my work has been accepted by the very highest echelons in academia and the mainstream media. Yet I'm being voted off the island by persons such as MLA, who doesn't know anything about the field and whose main contributions to Wikipedia have bee the creation of MMA articles. And this speaks to the larger ills of society itself, not just Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a tool that reflects society. We still, in the majority, value violence and sports over academic pursuits. Football, soccer, basketball players all make much more than college professors, even the best and brightest in the field. Thus the problem is not just with Wikipedia, but society itself.

Finally again, FYO I am more than two, but slightly less than three, standard deviations above the 'average' IQ, and therefore I see fit to say that I, like Michael C Price, and more than two orders of magnitude above the average member of society. Even if the average Wikipedian is slightly above societal average, we can still see the groundwork of 'one' order of magnitude higher. Of course, an established Wikipedian may be well above the average Wikipedia user, so again those comments were not about you personally but about the system, which I see as having quite many flaws. I do hope that these types of 'essays' will lead to 'constructive' improvements in the future.

Say what?

I decide to check out the AfD articles, not something I normally get involved in. I come to an article for deletion, A Course in Miracles (book). I look over it  I see it's been documented and footnoted almost to the very last comma. I observe a tremendous argument ensuing over one word, """"cult"""", that's being interpreted multiple ways. Multiple editors are squabbling over whether User:Ste4k is being """"POV"""" for using it. I change the wording to eliminate the troublesome word while meeting what I see as the intent of the original author of the quote, Garrett. I think I do an adequate if not very eloquent job. I go to a lot of effort to explain what and why I made the change, citing the dictionary, etc. I do screw up and forget to sign some of my work, which you helpfully catch and fix.

I then vote in the AfD to delete the article but to keep its content and merge it into the main article. I explain my reasoning, but without going into detail as to my views of both articles as they presently stand. If I had, I would have said something along the lines that the main article flows well and is comprehensive; I think it's generally well written. At the same time, it screams out for about 200 {{fact}} tags. It's not clear to me how reliable it is. The book article, by contrast, is not as pretty and, as the principal author herself more or less says, reads like a U.S. District Court decision. There's a reason judges' decisions are not high literature and that's because they're shooting for reliability and precision, not memorable prose. There's considerable overlap between both articles with much discussion as to whether there should be a book article and a movement article or just one combined article; there's even discussion as to whether the word """"movement"""" should be used. It seems to me as it all this talk of different articles is putting the cart before the horse (reliability), so I vote """"merge and delete"""" so that the overall Wikipedia coverage can get fixed and streamlined with some sort of consensus built.

Now I wake up and I find that you've spent hours during the night sarcastically mutilating your own article. It appears that one word, """"cult"""", and my good faith editing of its usage may have been your tipping point to go into a frenzy. That or my one vote in the AfD process. If you don't like my cult edit, just reverse it and explain how I got it wrong.

Then there's this message on my talk page:
""""I'm not originally from the U.S. I was born in Kharkov. In our country, we beat liars, and if one wants to eat, they work. The only POV in that article I wrote was that I wanted to find out the truth, did research, marked it with citations for verifiability, refused to consider any source that came from some primary provider, and all I found out for my trouble was that this encyclopedia isn't even worth quoting. You should be ashamed to have your familiy member's name on this medium.  """"

What do I make of this? Are you saying that I'm a liar and should (or would) be beaten? That I should be working harder to eat? And what's this about my family?

And as for Wikipedia, being flawed, it certainly is that. It is profoundly flawed in terms of the reliability of some of its material. In fact, if so many millions of people didn't use it, I'd say forget about it. But the fact is, Wikipedia is very important and growing in importance everyday. Every day, more people abandon traditional sources of reliable information such as Britannica and turn to Wikipedia. Every month, Wikipedia's Google rankings move up higher and are often in the top 5 for a given search. The fact that so many other sites such as answers.com mirror the content makes what's written in Wikipedia seem all the more """"reliable"""" since to the undiscerning, it looks like other sites are agreeing with Wikipedia.

So like it or not, Wikipedia is here to stay and further grow in importance. You can fume and I can fret, but our children and grandchildren will use it more and more as their first source of knowledge, reliable or not. That almost pessimistic view of Wikipedia's growing role is what motivates me  not some idealistic, Woodstockian notion that """"information longs to be free"""" or so much of the other idealistic stuff that motivates thousands of mostly earnest, smart but very young editors on this project.

I've extended your block to a week, because I think 24 hours is too lenient here. You've clearly been using at least three accounts to stack votes at ITN (if not elsewhere) and so obciously that it's almost as if you wanted to get blocked. Your actions have shown contempt for consensus and the community in a manner that I've almost never seen before. That you did this at ITN, where things are so much more laid back than in many parts of the project, makes this abuse even more shocking, which is the reason I've extended your block. I will say the following once, and once only: if you ever particiapte in the same discussion on Wikipedia under two identities, logged in or not, in an attempt to stack votes, I will block you indeifnitely and make a motion for a community ban.

Please provide a reference with verifable resources to prove your claim that
"""" a test """" is currently being done by WORKING Nomads or shepherds.

I have provided a New York times  link proving that in Russia and major cities of Central Asia it is NO longer a test but a blood sport.

For arguement sake lets say a test is done today .
Please discuss with me how a test can be done if the dogs that FAIL are not removed from breeding?

Why does this """"test"""" involve gambling? 

Please also tell me how dogs temperament and or working qualities are NOT inherited from the mothers side? Since only males are fougth.

In addition why does one have to test a dog to a dog if the dogs themselves are not working with livestock or will ever see a predator?

Please do not repeat here the information you can not prove but is your opinion on the main page.. 

Im quite sure ENGLISH links are available some where to prove this is a real working test vs the blood sport it has become.

 links 

Dharmabum420 and others seem to enjoy removing links from the article. I am not a webmaster or even know one. I found the site outside the wall on my space, and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites. I think it deserves a link here with the others. I must admit, I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin, but since then have fixed that. Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion, well I simply just copied the title of the page, it is not self promotion. Since then I have written what features the site holds, but it continues to be removed. Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info, and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia, so stop treating it as one. Thank you, please keep the link 
I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here.
I'll assume that it's not self-promotion despite the earlier """"greatest site ever!"""" type description, but regardless, I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site, for a variety of reasons:
Wikipedia is not a link repository, and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article, and we already have far more than that.
No Google hit within the first 100 links in a """"pink floyd"""" search and no Alexa rating; while not a set policy on Wikipedia, such rankings are often used to determine a site's notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well-stocked with other, high-rated sites.
The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people's tattoos. While mildly interesting, it's hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos.
Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account.
The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that's what I've got to try).
That's my 2¢ on this particular site. - a 

I'll double 's 2¢ and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel. It's a very sub-par site and doesn't contribute anything to this article.  

I will disagree with both of you. while you claim only one fan site is appropriate, it clearly states """"Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)"""" this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details. For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself. This site deserves a link and I disagree with both of you

 Also now that I think about it, show me another site that streams Davids mermaid gig, or has each of his promo videos for tracks of the new album? Not even DG.com has those avaialable anymore. Also how about the interview on the Roger waters tour page? Link the other fansite that has this. None do. This site was also the first that had Rogers complete touring band lineu",0

 Legal Action Against Wikipedia 

I've heard that rumors that legal action is being started against wikipedia as a result of this article for the following reasons:

1- the SCIMD sheild being used on this article is a copyrighted image that they refuse to remove even at the request of the holder of the copyright hence they are in violation of copyright laws.

2- Wikipedia and the users involved in editing this page, are being added to one (if not more) of the lawsuits due to the constant slander of the students and SCIMD in attempts to hurt the current and future student body?

> any comments from the posters on the above and the fact that letters from the lawyers for the school, copyright holder, and one of the lawsuits have been ignored repeatedly?

just curious 

 

To be honest, why would or should anyone care about rumors or random unsubstantiated threats from anyone on the internet? The apparent copyright status of the image is documented on the image page; anyone is welcome to comment about it there, but nobody has done so, or use any of the other mechanisms to resolve copyright concerns about media files. You should read WP:THREAT before continuing down this line of discussion.  

it is by no means a theat against anyone.  I was just curious as i had heard about the legal action being taken, and curious as to why no one else had commented about it or why nothing was done.  People are quick to post the negative and not question.  I also understand and see that if anyone trys to defend this school or post anything positive their accounts are removed and the conversation erased claiming vandalism or something else obscure, so i'm pretty sure this will be erased and my account and IP will be banned in typical fashion to surpress anything that doesn't conform.  

Sorry for jumping at you...I think I've been reading on-line ranters too long, and completely misread your intent.  

 Has anyone heard any rumors that SCIMD sued several editors, had its claims dismissed immediately, and was forced to pay damages as a result of bringing a facially unmeritorious lawsuit?  If anyone has heard any such rumors, do they have any comment?   

More seriously, Azrealist, I don't believe """"rumors"""" of a lawsuit  have you heard anything involving (1) what court the suit was filed in, (2) who was sued, and (3) what the case number was?  If not, I would assume that whoever told you the rumor was probably just some disgruntled person with a connection to SCIMD, trying to discourage editors from posting here.  (I'm not questioning your good faith, but I'm betting whoever told you the rumor is an SCIMD apologist . . .)   

From what i heard the suit or charges were being started/processed in NJ and Florida concomitantly with the other suits in progress. Sorry but i don't have anymore info than that.  If i knew all the facts i wouldn't have asked about it. 

I once heard some rumors that a poster on this talkpage did not understand anything about fair use and thought copyright meant that no one could use an image. Care to comment on that Azrealist? -[[User_talk:AKMask|ask]]

Unsourced Awards

First of all, thank you  and  for being fair and reasonable in regards to my edits to the Filmography section for this page.  I'm glad this page is finally starting to look like the others of its type found on Wikipedia.  

In regards to """"unsourced and ridiculous awards"""", I have sources for them, as you will see below, and they're not ridiculous.  For example, Meryl Streep's page has her NOMINATED for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress for The Iron Lady.  This means she ranked in one of the top 5-10 slots for said award, though she didn't win the award itself.  If you peruse her awards section, you will find many critics circle awards she did not win, but was """"nominated"""" for and the same applies to these awards.  This is common not just on Ms. Streep's page, but on other actors/actresses pages as well.  Nonetheless, I've made a compromise by removing Ms. Lange's actual rankings and replacing them """"Nominated"""" as per Ms. Streep's and others' pages.

Nice work
Greetings Athaenara, I see you maintaining WP:BLP/N and just wanted to say that it is good to see someone like yourself taking care of business there. Thanks for that. Also, I caught sight of your sig gallery and I must say that with the formatting and layout it is a pleasure to look at. Take it easy.  
Hey, thank you for the encouragement (BLP/N)!   If you don't mind, I'll put your comments about the gallery in the Gallery Guest Book section there, unless you would like to add your comments yourself—let me know.   
Autograph books are a bit contentious right now... I suppose I wouldn't mind if you transfer my comments there though. Cheers.  
Ah one other thing, many Wikipedia editor find large signatures annoying could you perhaps alter your to be like this: ? Large signatures tend to give sig users a bad name. -)  
It is not an autograph book (cf. my comments on the gallery talk page about that very thing) but a curated collection.  Thank you for your kind permission to add your comments to the guestbook.   

Inspired by your art
Hi, I feel inspired by your signature and a number of those in your gallery to render my own in an artistic fashion. I know how to do the art but is there a way to make it appear like that everytime I use the four tides or do I need to copy and paste all the time? -

I won't insist much here, because Wikipolicy is weak. It just says: Secondary sources are second-hand accounts, at least one step removed from an event. They rely for their material on primary sources, often making analytic or evaluative claims about them. For example, a review article that analyzes research papers in a field is a secondary source for the research. This publication is from 1635 (in fact you should have seen that it's in a print, and Guttenberg hadn't invented the press in the 15th century yet), and is talking about a person who had lived two centuries before: Skanderbeg died in 1468 and his father, (who had supposedly been in Kastoria) died in the 1430s, so Bardhi, the author, a catholic bishop, wrote more than two full centuries after.

 My concern about your username 
Hello, EELVIS AARON PPRESLY, and welcome to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy.

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians.  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User names.

"Wasn't Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion put together by dear Mr. Henry Ford, and then large quantities of it shipped to Nazi-Germany? That does tell you something about where these 'anti-semitic conspiracy theories' originated not - not from Hitler, that's for sure.

Charles Davenport even received a letter from a Jewish member of some editorial board concerning a racial hygiene board - previously this Jewish doctor had been considered for an editorial role on some German racial hygiene theory - but guess what - the Nazis didn't tell him he was soon about to become 'racially unfit' too. Talk about having some of your own medicine. Anyway, he wrote a letter to Charles Davenport pleading for him to denounce the Nazis' action. Guess what - not only did he NOT REPLY, but he also had leading positions on that same German magazine's editorial board a year later.

 Wikiproject proposal 

I've proposed a Panic! at the Disco Wikiproject here, to see how many people would be interested before starting one.

If you think that you'd be reguarly editing these pages, please put your name down at this page so we can see who would be interested in the project. Thanks in advance- '  talk |  

many people believe that the band members may be homosexuals but as they said in one of there interviews on absoluterock they said they confirmed """"none of the band members are gay not that theres anything wrong with it""""-ryan ross

Wouldn't things just be alot easier if people could all just agree on Panic! being emo? """"Emo"""" is basically this generation's """"grunge"""". Sure, the bands may not sound very similar to each other at all, but did Nirvana sound similar to Pearl Jam? No, not really. So just because Panic! and say, My Chemical Romance might not sound exactly similar that doesn't mean they can't be the same genre. And guess what- just because """"emo"""" bands hate being called that doesn't mean anything. """"Grunge"""" bands hated being called grunge too. 

And there definetly IS an emo sound. There's definetly a particular vocal style, lyrical style, and attitude that emo bands have.

Agreed, Panic! is an emo band, but many fans here seem to have a problem with that. 

A lot of people get really sensitive about things they like being labelled emo, I think it's just because the stereotypical emo isn't really something that a lot of people want to be associated with. I agree that the vocal style especially is emo, and the way they look is also associated with emo- not all songs, but some songs of theirs have 'emo-ish' lyrics, too. I'm fine with the genre being changed, it's just a matter of fans researching them here and becoming offended- instead of discussing it here, it's going to be changed back a lot. However, on the page it's set as emo and alternative rock, which is perfect. '  talk |

 Wapipedia 

Anyone here use it (http://wapipedia.org)? I'm kind of new to it, and there doesn't seem to be a talk/editing facility. So I'm going to post this here, hope that's okay. Their article on the Prophet Mohammed includes the following text:

By his own standards, the continuing traditions of social justice in the Islamic World, of methods and knowledge of science, history and medicine as they evolved in the modern world (thanks to his profound influence driving Muslims to literacy and inquiry), and the prayers of over one billion Muslims, many of whom pray for him five times a day (or attach """" peace be upon him"""" after each mention of his name), render Muhammad arguably the most influential man in all history, an honour often reserved for Jesus in the West. Even those historians who have deplored his influence and considered it to have retarded the growth of its chief rival faith, Christianity, express grudging admiration for the man.

and this:

To the traitors inside Medina it must have come as a surprise when the 10,000-strong force of Abu Sufyan failed to cross a trench dug around Medina by order of Muhammad, as the Persian scribe Salman e-Farsi had suggested to him. After the retreat of Abu Sufyan and his forces, the Muslims directed their attention towards the groups that had committed treason to the Charter of Medina. The munafiqun quickly crumbled, and their leader Abd Allah ibn Ubayy pledged allegiance to Muhammad. The Muslims then besieged the Banu Qurayza, who had intrigued against them. They had the opportunity of choosing Muhammad as an arbitrator, but instead the Banu Qurayza chose Saad ibn Muadh, the leader of their former allies, the Aus.

And this is its take on the Battle of Badr, 624 CE, which is markedly different to that found in the Wikipedia article (which raises doubts about the aftermath of the battle): 

On March 15, 624 near a place called Badr, the two forces clashed. Though outnumbered 800 to 300 in the battle, the Muslims met with success, killing at least 45 Makkans, including Abu Jahl, and taking 70 prisoners; whereas only 14 Muslims died. To the Muslims this appeared as a divine vindication of Muhammad's prophethood, and he and all the Muslims rejoiced greatly. Following this victory, assassinations eliminated Medinans who had satirized Muhammad, and the victors expelled a hostile Jewish clan. Virtually all the remaining Medinans converted and Muhammad became de facto ruler of the city. 

I had the idea that Wapipedia was a direct transfer of Wikipedia articles onto Wap, but it seems not. Timbudds@acasa.ro""",0

"""What I was saying was that South Africa was never a """"black"""" country. The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, """"independecne"""" and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up. The economy is approximately 15 % what it was under """"deliberate discrimination"""". There are massive blackouts every day, and the only people who are well off are the Marxist puppets who are the ANC, the druglords, and people who install security systems.

 Well, hope the floor didn't hurt. But your characterization of my attitude and what I respect and don't is to say the least dubious. Did it occur to you that I didn't attend your schools, have different experiences, different parents, and can think for myself? There is plenty of room for differences in interpretation, as anyone that has mediated flame wars here, as I have can tell you. One cranky old editor spouting off does NOT make for a battle. OTOH, similar frank opinions have almost universally in the past resulted in a good working relationship, a clear communication, and about 3/4ths of the time, resulted in a new Wikifriend. So piffle to WP:CIVyou're not looking at the context, nor the intent of the context for that guideline. Being polite can in fact be counterproductive and a time waste, a matter of judgmentmine, as the observer. Take Quiddity (who signed up at page top for example) who once demonstrated a unbelievable tendency to pro-offer unwarranted judgments and unsolicited advice. Ultimately, I had to get firm with him and sent this, which he threatened to post, SO I DID. Nothing there to be ashamed of, you see. Bottom line... there are some people in this world that need rapped along side the ear to get their attention. There are others that need to have their toes stepped on, UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE. Both those types benefit some by being jerked up by the shorthairs. Failing all else, it makes me feel better, and communicates at least one person, however crazy they may think me, has less than steller appreciation for their actions as they impact othersnormally others time. I really don't get excised much here about anything else. Endless editing and all that, after all.Sooooo, Thanks for the appeal to my vanity, but I suggest in the future you counsel people to examine whether a situation is ongoing, escalating, or one time episode of venting. I spent 2-1/2 years here acting as a mediator myself, and would never have considered involving myself in an isolated message based case. Not sensible. Call it justifiable road rage if you like—a real world situation here in cyber space, and  at least I cleaned up the vulgarity of what I had written in the first three drafts, to make my loathing judgment of his lazy rape of hundreds of pages plain. THAT is where I put my loyalty and focus. NOT on one of thousands of arguable interpretation of various guidelines and policies. If your INTERPRETATION of WP:CIV prohibits any colorful idiom or addressing a dumbshit-thing-to-do as a dumbshit act, I'm definitely done here. I'm floored that you haven't the imagination to understand that— save for the hyperbole about kicking ass, a deliberate attempt to indicate how poorly I viewed the 5-6 hours a day of well over six weeks of effort fixing his rape pogrom allegedly following guidelines — nor the fact that you were all being busy-bodies making much ado about nothing. One of the most reprehensible facts about contributing here is that there is a total insensitivity to the leisure time our contributors make, particularly by 'blithely accepting actions', one way or another, deleting their hard work and effort, which is about as personal an attack as one can make... Show me where NPA THE LEAST SENSITIVE to that VERY REAL, VERY PERSONAL virtual 'slap in the face'.  And fools wonder why we have editor retention rate problems! Wake the fuck up. THAT IS A REAL WORLD PROBLEM, not my slight episode of 'hitting' to administer a lesson in courtesy to others. (Call me twisted, but a single discourtesy to me  administered to make the point is properly due those who exercise the ultimate discourtesies, really without due process. Making 180 article pages into redirects without involving the community at large in the decision is to me, WP:BOLD applied way over the top. AFD or MFD should have been invoked, at the least. Not one talk page and three or four editors without a direct attempt to re-involve the originator of same articles, or their major contributors. BOTH THOSE badly need a quorum count provision, but I digress, the digression.) Those articles nearly 200 some were something apparently dozens put up... involving hundreds of man-hours and were well crafted. Oh, they needed some cites for a few fannish statements of cause and effect, but the necessity of that is itself doubtful in cultural articles about recently produced intellectual efforts. WP:AGF should be sufficient for such a report making a statement like """"this is the first (last) episode character/actor-so-and-so appeared in, and so forth.

Let us examine what is considered """"Black"""" in the context of this very article. At the very top it states:

""""It is also used to categorize a number of diverse populations together based on historical and prehistorical ancestral relationships. Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent (see African diaspora). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro-hair texture (although a recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations). Other definitions of the term """"black people"""" extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to Oceania and Southeast Asia""""

This article even mentions Oceanians and Southeast Asians (such as the Great Andamanese, Native Fijians, the Ati,  and the Melanesians) even though these groups genetically have more in common with neighboring Asian populations and are very distant from other people who are considered Black Africans. Ethiopians are black Africans. Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black. They used the term """"Ethiopian"""" to describe all Black Africans they came across, regardless of their location outside of East Africa (read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_expeditions_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa)

I went to the Beta Israel page and found two very clear references:

Simon D. Messing (1982). The Story of the Falashas """"Black Jews of Ethiopia"""". Brooklyn. ISBN 0-9615946-9-1

Here's more from another article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Israel#Black_Hebrew_Israelite_immigration)

""""The Israeli government has airlifted black Ethiopian Jews to Israel and given them citizenship in the same way it has been a haven to Jews oppressed throughout the Middle East and Africa""""

""""She told RT: “They don't want poor or black children and Depo-Provera gave them the opportunity to have control. If she [a patient] keeps taking an injection every three months, she is not going to have children – you know it is a 100 per cent secure from children I think.”

Hedva says the policy is working – the number of black babies in Israel is decreasing, but there are no official statistics to back up her claim. For community workers and Ethiopian women here, statistics are unnecessary – they feel their reality speaks for itself.

Wikipedia:Surveillance awareness day
You were supportive of the idea that Jehochman proposed: """"A message is most effective when it matches the format of the media. We're an encyclopedia. On Feb 11, I suggest we fill our front page with articles, blurbs and news about mass spying and privacy. That will send a strong message, and help educate people. It's sort of like what we do on April 1, except serious instead of foolish.""""

Since this proposal received so much support, I and several others have done our best to begin the process of implementation.   That said, the proposal is very controversial with Main Page insiders who have, understandably, objections that boil down to WP:NOTADVOCATE.

It's valuable to have feedback from people who oppose any deviation from the status quo, but we really need feedback from people who understood Jehochman idea, supported it, and could tell us whether we're succeeding in """"implementing the vision"""" that Jehochman laid out and how to improve the proposal.    

If you have the time, would you lend your view over at Wikipedia:Surveillance awareness day.  If you want to see a list of custom content that could be available, we have a Arbitrary mockup #2, that shows lots of proposed content on one page. 

Your feedback is most appreciated.

 Wikipedia and copyright 
 Hello Jbeck8924, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to 401 Derby has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied or translated without attribution. If you want to copy or translate from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing.

 Advice 
We cannot display copyright material, even temporarily. The blanking template on the article gives you a link to a temporary page where you can draft a new article. Please note that:
Minor rewording is not enough to avoid a breach of copyright - see Wikipedia:Copy-paste
You will need to establish notability, a requirement to have a Wikipedia article, which is not a matter of opinion but must be demonstrated by showing """"significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject."""" Significant means more than just listing-type mentions; reliable excludes Myspace, Facebook, blogs, places where anyone can post anything; independent excludes the subject's own website, affiliated ones and anything based on press releases. The notability standard for academics is explained at WP:Notability (academics).
Wikipedia requires a neutral point of view. You should take care to avoid a promotional tone and PR-speak """"peacock terms"""" like """"highly respected"""" and """"prestigious"""".

I think that most dissenters would acknowledge that their views are not by this definition """"fact"""", that is, they would not claim that their views are """"built on empirical evidence"""". Frankly, the definition of fact is very much linked with the definition of science, as the goal of science is the establishment of fact. Thus, statements about which there is no fact-based debate, such as the roundness of the earth, can be stated as fact. Non-fact-based dissenting views can be stated as dissenting views, preferably in their own articles to avoid confusing the fact-seeking encyclopedia user.
The alternative, as far as I can figure, is to not state anything at all as fact, which would make Wikipedia a useless hellish cauldron of boiling fat. As one who believes that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, this isn't a very attractive prospect. If anyone can think of a different way to determine what can be stated as fact, go right on ahead.   07:41, 29 January 2006""",0

"""==History==
FYI: """"Galen, a physician in second-century Rome, dissected pigs and goats, and is known as the """"father of vivisection."""" [17]""""

This claim comes from a section on the LPAG site that says: """"Then, during second century Rome, a physician named Galen began to dissect animals because Church protocol did not allow human autopsies. He began to dissect goats and pigs and compared his findings to what he knew about humans. He is now known as the """"father of vivisection.""""2

Following this citation back, it comes from Greek CR, Greek JS (2000) Sacred Cows and Golden Geese. The Continuum International Publishing Group, Inc., New York, New York., which, in turn, is based on a passage from Hans Ruesch's Slaughter of the Innocent.

From 157 and 161, Galen worked as a doctor to gladiators at Pergamum. This was around the time that Christians were being persecuted by Roman authorities and used as dispoable items in the games. Galen undoubtedly had opportunity to examine many ripped and torn human bodies, and there is no reason to imagine that he would not have been allowed to fiddle about on dying Christians, though I've come across no records that he did. """"Church protocol,"""" in this referenced passage is a claim not supported by the historical setting.

Here's a statement from another website: """"Vivisection originated in second century Rome when Galen, physician to gladiators, was prevented from continuing his dissections of human cadavers by the Church-led moral opposition. He switched his attention to goats and monkeys instead and thus became the 'father of vivisection'. http://www.allaboutanimals.org.uk/PT-Testing.asp

And another: """"In second century Rome, the state-supported Church frowned upon the co-called desecration of human corpses and autopsies were outlawed. With no human bodies to learn from, the respected physician to the gladiators, Galen, had little choice but to cut up pigs and other animals, hence earning him the title 'Father of Vivisection.'"""" http://www.ark-ii.com/campaigns/

This is a widespread claim, undermined when it is realized that Christians had no standing in the Roman Empire during Galen's time. What is very likely is that Galen learned things about human physiology from seeing so many people ripped apart, stabbed, clubbed, mauled, and otherwise opened to inspection. He probably sought to test his conjectures about what all this exposed tissue actualy did by dissecting living animals; at a tme when no real pain relief was available, a person in his position must have grown innured to seeing others' agony. This would have made his animal victims' cries unremarkable to him.

A more believable source observes: """"Under Nero in the 1st century AD, even the torture of Christians became a star attraction at the Circus Caligulas. There were few protests against such marketable massacres."""" http://www.iridescent-publishing.com/rtm/ch1p1.htm

Just another example of the way that questionable claims become """"fact"""" in today's virtual world. Becareful about what you read and cite.

As coincidence would have it, I just happened to be reading The Jeffersonian Gunboat Navy by Spencer Tucker. During the ARW there were two terms used for these ships. One was """"gondola"""" (apparently not to be confused with the gondolas of Venice) and the other """"galley"""" but he makes no mention of """"row galley.""""

However, I too have seen the US Navy using all three names: """"gondola"""", """"galley"""", and """"row galley."""" at random. Most of these terms are found in the various articles contained within DANFS. 
What needs to be said though is that I've found Tucker's works to be a bit sloppy and often lacking in full explanations. He tends to gloss over descriptions that really should be explained completely for clarity.   """,0

"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden, and engaging in misrepresentation in using an arbitrator's view on a separate matter to be absolute on all matters. It contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.   

The assumption of bad faith is on your part, for you clearly have not read - NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. You seem to have a disregard for due procedure and norms. [[User:Ncmvocalist|Ncmvoca",0

I'll clear this up about my intentions:  I have been told, or glanced over (in passing) several materials purporting the Caribbean slave contribution to the population of Charleston and Savannah (among New Orleans and other multiracially populated areas).  It is also rather obvious about the romantic Pocahontas connection to ideas of Roanoke survivors, in discussions of Virginia.  These things are dismissed as fancy, but they are distinct beliefs of those who attempt to put a face on what the Melungeon community has had as an inception.  So you see, I am an extreme skeptic to the fantasies described by ignorant rednecks...but I do in fact think they are relevant to the beliefs of those promoting the Melungeon identity.  One need not endorse a belief of association, but merely allow others to see what sort of identities Melungeon life has acquired.  I am confident to declare that there is so much myth obfuscating the reality of what life is like in Appalachia.  Appalachian culture is from the Deep South to Maritime Canada.  Melungeon culture is centred on the Gulf coast and south of Bermuda on the Eastern seaboardoriginally Spanish areas.  People think that just because impoverished Scotch-Irish on the frontier dressed in buckskin and furs, that they were some """"noble savages"""" (though they were not Cherokee, but in fact Andrew Jackson's henchmen).  So many ideas here wreak of Crank (person) nonsense.  Are you the spin doctors making apologetics for the Antebellum South, by having it seem like the perpertrators are actually descended from the victims?  Are you sitting in a trailor right now, trying to deny your Jerry Springer lifestyle?  Civil War's Reconstruction is a real bitch?!

That white Spanish territory is the Melungeon core, in true history.

See here:
Hispanics contributed Melungeon heritage, via Louisiana and Florida colonies.  This was much different from slave owners who raped slaves to make more slaves.  Melungeons were basically the first Hispanics in the United States, whom often lived in secret or adapted to Anglo ways.  Please, do not spread fantasies as facts in this article!

I am not trying to completly trying to erase the face that Raven was their co-star in the movies. But she was never a meber of the REAL LIVE group. And like I said, the """"Greatest Hits"""" album is just a rumor, as is the reality show. I don't know what will happen but as of right now, I am all for your idea of having Galleria away and bringing Anginette in. I don't know if they should bring her into the real live group though, depening on who they bring in. And as for the rumor of Jessica Benson being cast a Cheetah Girl for the 3rd movie, I DO NOT want that to happen. 3LW is (in my opinon) way to mature for Cheetah fans to hear and having a group within a group is ridiculous. But...3LW's album has been pushed back from 2003 to 2007 already which leads me to the face that 3LW may have to face the music that the may be over and it may be the best thing for Jessica to join the Cheetahs. I mean, really old artists have MySpace pages where they just add their """"greatest hits"""". 3LW is already doing exactly that which leads me to believe that 3LW may be over and Jessica Benson may be joining the Cheetahs. 

If 3LW is over than I am all for Jessica joining the Cheetahs as Anginette. But if 3LW remains a group, then I am completly against Jessica joining them. And if 3LW is over and she joins the Cheetahs, this may be the way to get older fans to listen to The Cheetah Girls. I guess some part of the girls fate is on the hand of 3LW.  03:03, 31""",0

Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is a R&B; and pop singer, songwriter, record producer and occasional actress of the 1990s and 2000s. Making her debut in 1990, she became the most successful and best-selling artist of the coming decade according to Billboard magazine and the World Music Awards. In 2000, the World Music Awards show named her the best-selling female recording artist of all time.

Carey is noted for her distinctive singing style that makes frequent use of melismas and other ornamentation, and she possesses a five-octave vocal range. She released a throng of number-one hits while signed to Columbia Records, formerly run by then-husband Tommy Mottola, and several of them broke chart records. By the turn of the millennium, however, Carey's popularity with critics and the public had entered decline, and she was dropped from her new record label following a highly-publicised physical breakdown and an unsuccessful foray into film. In 2005, Carey returned to the forefront of popular music with the release of the multi-platinum The Emancipation of Mimi.

Biography and music career
Early life and discovery
Carey was born in Huntington, New York. She is the third and youngest child of Patricia Hickey, a Catholic opera singer and voice coach of Irish-American descent, and Alfred Roy Carey (né Núñez), an aeronautical engineer of Afro-Venezuelan descent. She was named after the song """"And They Call the Wind Maria"""", from the musical Paint Your Wagon. Carey's siblings include her older sister Alison, and her older brother Morgan. As a multiracial family, the Carey household was met with racial slurs, hostility, and sometimes violence, causing the family to move frequently around the New York area. The strain on the family led to the divorce of Carey's parents when she was three years old. Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family.

Spending much of her time at home alone, Carey turned to music as an outlet. She began singing at the age of four, and first performed in public at the age of six. She began writing songs while in grade school, and her mother and the members of her opera company were impressed with her talents when Carey hit a cue note that her mother had missed. Carey attended and graduated from Oldfield Middle School and Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, although she was frequently absent due to efforts to break into the music business. After moving to New York City, she eventually landed a role as a backup singer for Brenda K. Starr.

In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party, where Starr gave him a demo tape. Mottola played the tape while leaving the party and was very impressed by what he heard. He returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This Cinderella-like story became part of the standard publicity surrounding Carey's entrance into the industry.

1990–1992: Early commercial success
Carey's professional music career began with the release of her eponymous debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990. Carey co-wrote all of the compositions on her debut album with songwriter-producers such as Ric Wake and Rhett Lawrence, and would continue to co-write nearly all of her material for the rest of her career. The album debuted low on t",0

There are some sketchy things going on with this talk page. All this text recommending deletion was mysteriously archived a few days after it was posted - while everything else on the talk page remained there for nine months. I cut and pasted it again here last week, and -voila!- the same text recommending deletion was archived again today! Hmmm... Anyway, these above entries are nice reports, though unfortunately they do not add much to the questions on notability. The concept of notability must be established through certain types of references (regardless of a person's opinion of the individual). The question is why/how does these references establish notability? If he's interviewed about something, that establishes the notability of the subject of the interview. Rather than saying """"this seems to me to [this or that]"""" - responses on this topic need to be """"this reference establishes/fails to establish notability because..."""" The further one reads into the wiki explanations about notability for people, these cites for Raymond do not have material that is even close:
The person has received a well-known and significant award or honor, or has been nominated for one several times. The person has made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his or her specific field. Generally, a person who is """"part of the enduring historical record"""" will have been written about, in depth, independently in multiple history books on that field, by historians. A politician who has received """"significant press coverage"""" has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple news feature articles, by journalists. An actor who has been featured in magazines has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple magazine feature articles, by magazine article writers. An actor or TV personality who has """"an independent biography"""" has been written about, in depth, in a book, by an independent biographer. 
This Raymond page is obviously someone's baby, and someone who's account was removed due to sockpuppeting was posting on this talk page last year. That doesn't mean that Raymond shouldn't have a wikipedia page. But the references here don't add up to notability as notability has been described by wikipedia.  """,0

I know about the rule regarding individual research, but I did a term paper in college about this that I'm going to try to dig up and use the bibliography.

The Source provided was from a fin/estonian. I really don't appreciate this source, as there is
1. No proof for his claims about Russian casualties, as those bodies found were not Russian sailors. They would be buried in the sea, rather then transported a long way to some islands.
2. The galleys easily outmanouverd the Swedish fleet, and boarded them. The Swedes got smashed, and end of story. 

I really am tired of your editing, and I've provided numerous sources. We only need one casualty figure, and I believe official Russian sources far outweighs the history scenario your book present.

We are not assessing the truth claims of a religion - we are assessing the historicity of an individual.  I would actually be quite happy for evidence to exist - it would make the subject more interesting and wouldn't cause the least problem for my view that the supernatural is merely wishful thinking.  Proving a certain man existed ~2000 years ago is a long way from turning him in to a god!  I'm pretty certain Michael Travesser exists, but he ain't anything other than a delusional man - despite what he and his followers believe.
As for your weak attack on my lack of expertise, it's irrelevant.  I'm as capable of sourcing and quoting expert references as the next person.  Wikipedia would be a desolate place if your reinvention of policy was implemented and only experts were able to contribute.  Your irrationality is beginning to show - 'Jesus historicity' and 'Jesus myth' are very much the same thing.

Wikipedia requires that user-created images be under a free license: one that permits unrestricted reproduction and modification.  However, there is a way around this.

If you want to restrict who can use your images, your best bet is to license them under the GFDL, with an offer to let people use them under other license terms if they ask.

The GFDL is a very awkward license for images.  It was designed around the needs of the emacs user manual, and requires that the full text of the license be included anywhere that material under the license is published, and that any work containing GFDL material be licensed under the GFDL.  This isn't a problem for things as large as websites and books, but it's not practical for smaller things such as posters and magazine articles, and for-profit companies usually don't want to publish their work under anything but simple copyright.

So, by licensing under the GFDL, you let the images be used on Wikipedia and related projects (such as Wikibooks or Wikipedia Commons), on Wikipedia re-users such as Answers.com, and on other GFDL-licensed websites.  At the same time, you make it difficult to use the image in printed works and in commercial projects, giving you some control over who re-uses your images.

"That Austin Allegro pic 

I think the pic of a 1979 Austin Allegro is actually a Vanden Plas either 1500 or 1750 model. You can tell by the raised grille attached to the bonnet - the VP was a luxury (sic) version of the Allegro mark 2 model produced between 1975 and 1979. It had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats, and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic. The VP was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring? It was probably produced because Ford was having big success with the Ghia versions of some of its models, upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged, and cash-strapped BL was desperate for some of the action. The reason for raising this is that VPs weren't actually badged as Austins (or Allegros for that matter), but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same BL dealderships,so the pic shouldn't appear on the Austin history page cos it isn't.

"WARNING: Future Perfecta at Sunrise IS A MEMBER OF THE WIKIPEDIAN GREEK NATIONALISTIC JUNTA. By User:Balkan

""" and the guys. What does Vegas, hospital visits, Streisand and the firing of Red, Sonny and David have to do with their violent behaviour and games such as War?   

I'd like the bits mentioned above to remain for the reasons stated by ElvisFan1981.   

A separate section on Elvis and violence? I think not. Some stuff could be added to the Memphis Mafia article if it's new. However, it may well be that more detail may be too much, but that can be appraised here and when it crops up in the article - as can comparisons with other authors' interpretations. I'll probably make edits to trim or to make additions more concise, as I have been. If anyone disagrees, I'm sure they'll comment. I'm glad   is taking such an interest in this article - and they have a talk page (my mistake for not noticing).   

A proposed inclusion reads: """"On May 20, Presley’s bodyguards were involved in a fight with a drunk man outside Presley’s hotel suite. The man had been asked to leave the hallway, but became aggressive and began punching and kicking anyone near by. Presley was entertaining his daughter Lisa Marie at the time, and upon hearing the commotion outside, reached for his guns. This was during the Patty Hearst kidnapping, and, according to David Stanley, “Elvis feared for Lisa’s safety”. The incident resulted in a lawsuit against Sonny West, Dick Grob and David Stanley. Although not physically involved in the attack, Presley was also named on the lawsuit. It was resolved a year later with an out of court settlement, but Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident (he had punched the man while he was handcuffed). David Stanley recalled Presley telling him later that this was one of the reasons West would later be fired.""""

According to Peter Guralnick and the complainant Presley witnessed this """"fight"""", more like an assault, but did nothing to stop it. Four men held the man down, """"and the rest beat him to a bloody pulp."""" As David Stanley was part of this, and the author of the above account, I think he might be a teeny bit biased in his own favour. Jerry Hopkins' book concurs with this. 

I suggest: On May 20, Presley’s bodyguards were involved in an incident with a drunk man outside Presley’s hotel suite. The man had thrown breaker switches and several men followed by Presley poured into the darkened hallway. This was during the Patty Hearst kidnapping and, according to David Stanley, “Elvis feared for Lisa’s safety”, who was staying in the suite at the time. When the lighting was restored, four men including David Stanley, held the man while three others """"beat him to a bloody pulp."""" The incident resulted in a lawsuit against Sonny West, Dick Grob and Stanley. Although not physically involved in the attack, Presley was also named on the lawsuit. It was resolved a year later with an out of court settlement. Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident, but fans who witnessed it claimed that Presley simply stood by doing nothing to stop the beating. David Stanley recalled Presley telling him later that this was one of the reasons West would later be fired. (citations to be added of course).

I think this anecdote is a good tie-in with the book West & co would publish. It could go in the Memphis Mafia article if needed; for this article it might need trimming a bit.   

I like the rewrite above. I'm torn now about whether to include it in the article, though. Part of me thinks it's important because it is one of the few noteworthy things Presley actually got involved in between 1974 and 1976 (Most of that time was touring), and it does bring a better understanding to the firing of West and co. Another part of me agrees it could be shortened, but each time I read it I struggle to decide which parts should be removed as I find it all important. Perhaps removing the line; Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident, but fans who witnessed it claimed that Presley simply stood by doing nothing to stop the beating. and just going straight from the settlement into David Stanley recalled Presley telling him later that Wests' aggressive beating of the man was one of the reasons he would later be fired.

The gameplay will be largely the same as EQ2, but it's still a good idea to include a brief overview and a link to EverQuest II#Gameplay. Information on new features could also be merged to this section.

 Email haxing 

Some random dude did an article drive by here and got a bee up his butt and decided to start tearing stuff up without even bothering to talk to anybody about it fist or justifying it what so ever.  I don't know if he is trying to white wash the article or is meat puppeting for someone else who's been trying to white wash here in the past.  I just do not know.  But I see the distruction he has caused and I weep.  No, not really.  But it is pretty lame nonetheless.

So why is this stuff in here?  Well some guy haxed her emails and cell phones - just like he did with 50 other celebrities.  He haxed and stole all kinds of extremely sexually explicit photographs.  So now the haxer dude gets caught and the Fed want a 60 year sentence.  But they back down to a 6 yr one.  But, the random haxer dude has got to pay Rene, my sweet, dear, poor Rene over $76,000 in """"restitution.""""  This is for about 20 pics of Rene stuffing a dildo in every hole of her body.

The Feds worked on this case for nearly a year and talked to more than 50 haxing victims.

But you, Mr. Random Dude, by wandering in here on a drive by and white washing, you denigrate Rene's status as an innocent victim here.  You are telling the world that We - Wikipedia - could careless about how you have been so wrongly injured that we are just going to bury the truth like it never happened.

This event was an extremely signifant event for her and her life will never be the same afterwards (or, it won't be the same till she cashes her $76,000 check, eh?).

So, Mr. Random dude white washer, what have you to say to justify your actions?  Oh, and please don't come back with some kind of lame responce like, """"Well, I have been here longer and I am going to throw my Wiki weight around and you got to do what I say because I am King of the Wiki Hill here or I will ban you, etc., etc..""""

 Capitalisation of waterways features 

Hi. Can you please point me to the WP:MOS page that says all individual bridges, tunnels, locks, etc must be described in lower case? As far as I am concerned, Basingstoke Canal and Foxton Locks are proper nouns and should be capitalised as such. It is correct to talk about """"the locks at Foxton"""", and """"the canal in Basingstoke"""", but using mixed capitalisation is misleading: Foxton locks suggests a type of lock known as 'Foxton'.  You could not correctly say a Bath deep lock, unless there was more than one of them: one would write 'the Bath Deep Lock. There is only one """"Bath Deep Lock"""" so """"Bath deep lock"""" is not an appropriate nomenclature, however Bath chair and Bath bun describe generic items and should not be capitalised.

Could you please double-check your reference for this format and apply the necessary corrections? Thank you.

"Centrifugal Force 

Acroterion, recently you took an interest in the centrifugal force page. I would be most grateful if you could look at the recent deletion of my edit on the main page of that article. If you check it out, you will find that Wolfkeeper has a long record of deleting things which I put on the main article.

When I put that edit on yesterday, I was fully expecting Wolfkeeper to delete it. But I was very careful to make sure that the edit contained only basic textbook material and that there could be no possible grounds to justify him deleting it.

You will recall that my block last week was because I was accused of incivility by having accused Wolfkeeper of wikistalking for having deleted stuff that had put on the main page.

Interestingly, Wolfkeeper has attempted to justify his actions this time. His first reason was pathetic. It was something to do with the section being out of place. The second reason merely exposes Wolfkeeper's total lack of knowledge about the topic in question.

The marble experiences a side on Coriolis force as it rolls out to the edge of the turntable. Interestingly, PhySusie who I presume was attempting to back up Wolfkeeper has then come in and stated this very fact as if it were me that didn't know it.

Dear Woolworths Foundation Board of Trustees,

As you requested, here are the faculty recommendations regarding the qualifications of the Umbridge Twins (Mike and SB_Dolores) to assume the duties of Headmaster here at Woolworths School of Political Dramaturgy.

We were especially impressed by the recent production in which the impressionable young students of Woolworths School of Political Dramaturgy were inducted into the long-forgotten practice of employing Parliamentary Bill of Attainder.  The symbolic allusions to the Trial Scene from Alice in Wonderland was an especially brilliant maneuver.

We are confident that, with the Umbridge Twins in charge, our students will quickly learn all the well-known hoary practices from the rubbish heap of political history dating back to the Forgotten Realms of Hammurabi.

And, at the end of the term, all the students are cordially invited to Go Jump In the Lake.

I know allegations of admin abuse require clear proof, but it may be below. See, I wouldn't mind so much if I knew what bad behavior I was doing. I have in good faith begged and pleaded for anyone, anyone with expertise or experience to explain what was blockable; please take the time to review considerately. At virtually every turn, when I requested a policy clarification as a 2-month user, if I even got a cite, it was only to a whole policy page, and never with a diff to my alleged offense. This behavior is so consistent from so many users that it is hard to explain, much less to provide sources for this possibly exceptional claim. But let's please start with what points I do get, and the questions I need answered first by you, the reviewer:
(N.b. I wrote this the first hour of block. I trustingly clicked Save and did not realize that there would be an edit conflict due to the edit warrior (below) closely following me and stating her block agreement """"sadly"""" (huh?) and giving nuanced advice and compliments (unhelpful). This minor frustration can be gotten past, but of course this request is now many hours late. PLEASE at least quickly indicate willingness to answer.)
See whole discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:POINT is intended to refer to my politely proposing a change to WP:V (my first policy suggestion) and disclosing what I regarded as an edit war about the issue. Instead of any comments on the merits (except one positive one), I received consistent criticism about my poor formatting followed by refusal to address the merits because (apparently) it was obviously unnecessary to answer. Q. When one has made a policy suggestion in good faith and one receives zero discussion on its negatives and significant negative discussion on one's person and presentation, is one refusing to get the point if one continues politely requesting the specific demerits of the proposal that would indicate nonconsensus on its merits?
See whole user discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:HAR (first I've heard of this charge against me) is intended to refer to my appropriate-level user warnings in response to an editor using obscenity and assuming bad faith this is only the most reasonable guess, of course. After he stated he was entitled to assume bad faith, he changed up and claimed facetiously he really was assuming good faith. My links there indicate specifically what behavior I referred to. I know of no other case which might come near to harassment. Q. When one uses edit warnings in full compliance with policy and is met with continuing bad faith, is one harassing?
See whole COI discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:DE is intended to refer primarily to my first extended correction of a user charging me with COI, along with a suggestion that the accusing user may also have COI. Certainly I might have been overstrong in that edit (I recognize not noticing the 200-word limit, but I adverted that myself). But again, there was no indication of why a donor to a political candidate has the sort of close relationship envisioned by COI. There was one attempt at googling me (and I'm not looking up the personal details policy right now) which turned up nothing undisclosed besides my blog comments but this was described as """"considerable involvement of ... promotional activities"""". Recall there are about 60,000 Ron Paul Meetup volunteers, and nearly that many donors. If I worked for a 60,000-member workplace there might be a bit more point, but even that would be debatable in good faith. Q. Is every political donor or Meetup member forbidden from editing candidate-related articles neutrally, or only those who willingly disclose the relationship?
As near as I can tell, there is a further potential application of WP:POINT (which by the way is an application of the rule, convenient to the generic, that a generic warning is fungible with any warning). Apparently I don't realize that, in some sense, these users are every one justified in refusing to explain specifically any of their adverse actions against me, and that I am being disruptively pointed if I explain specific charges against them, citing policy and diffs. And there I do admit not understanding. The policies are no Procrustean bed, but very specific. I am completely unfamiliar with operating in such an environment other than to do one's best to WP:AGF, to complain properly and carefully, and to accept potential suffering for it. However I'm essentially barred by generic threats (yes) from complaining specifically, and I'm completely certain that a generic, unsourced complaint from me (as appears to be the",0

Dear Wikipedia """"""""Neutrality"""""""" guardian, 
Re Saddam Hussein entry,
no one has yet to answer my question, why do the live palestinians deserve mention in the 
primary intro for a non palestinian leader, but the Slaughtered Kurds of Saddam's own countrymen do not? 

You could have Written """"Some parts of the Arab world admired Saddam for standing up to the west"""". Without mentioning the Palestinians, just like you refuse to mention the slaughtered 
Kurds. But you insist on mentioning the Palestinians, and further conceal any remnant of opposing POV with the fascist's friend, the term  """"human-rights situation"""" which you hope anyone can interpret as anything. 
Are you claiming that the horrors both existed and didn't exist, depending on who you ask? where are all those dead kurds, then?

revive them! I'm sure they will be glad to read in wikipedia that what was done to them was only """"a situation"""". A situation is good. Elain in Seinfeld has situations. comes and goes. They can dig up their graves and go home to watch the reruns.

Never mind the bodies, they will soon rot and everyone would have forgotten all about it. Shhhhhhh. But Only one thing as sure as the Sun existed, didn't it? The palestinians and their glee! thats as solid as Iron! who needs proof? its the Palestinians! Amen!
Do you have a paraplegic handy by any chance?
 
I want to know a rational arumgent of why it is so important and humanitarian to 
disguise Saddams undisputed, DNA proven horrors. It must be VERY important. there must
be some divine logic here beyond my rationality.
Oh, It will upset the palestinians? sure! don't you think Saddam's other little hobbies (other than encouraging palestinians) have upset at least the same number of people or largeer? why do you stifle their emphasis then?
Either you stifle ALL non Iraqi effects of Saddam, or you mention them NEUTRALLY
that means not ONLY the palestinians!
 
Are you perhaps saying that 10,000 gassed kurds and their millions of grieving relatives/supporters are less important than 2 million live palestinians with no direct contact to Iraqi affairs other than a blushing glee at Saddam's deeds?
if so, how many? how many non-palestinians does it take to die till that issue becomes 
important enough to mention if it contrasts the palestinian POV?  a million? 6 million by any chance? does this number mean anything to you or do you just file it in you head as
""""Human rights situation""""? 

and how many palestinians angry that 1+1=2 would it take for you to remove all the
henceforth controversial entries on mathematics? 3 palestinians? 4 perhaps?
remember how to count women They won't like it unless you count women as 1:2 for men.
they might cause something to your """"Human rights situation"""" otherwise. 

And this pargraph:

an increase in human-rights abuses, notably acts of genocide against Iraqi Kurds. The United States continued to view Saddam with deep suspicion, however, primarly due to his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction

do you have any factual references that dispute any of this? supported FACTS not 'liberal' wishful illusions!   all of it is corroborated in the links!

And this,

""""Thanks for pointing this out. I suspect that it was removed because an anon is getting a kick out replacing non-controversial matter-of-fact statements like the above with overtly emotive, deliberately provocative ones.""""

Are you hinting that this sentence:
""""While he remained a popular hero among many disaffected Arabs for standing up to the West and for his unflinching support for the Palestinians""""

is a NPOV? what proof do you have of his support of the palestinians? are ther
any references of this, or just hearsay?

Just call wikipedia the Western Edition of Pravda, and be done with it!
(never mind that the Palestinian POV is merely matter of morale, and the opposing POV rests on actual crimes of war! how in your humane conscience can you condone this state of affairs?)
And I dont wan't to skewer anyone either. If I wante to Skewer Saddam, I would have called him a Hitler wannabe; Little Stalin,  the prince of evil and so forth. This is skewering.
Mentioning FACTS is never skewering, even if the palestinians don't like them!

"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America aswell as areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown.

Here are some examples of what true hazel eyes are;

Hazel Eye Picture On The Right

The picture on the right hand side of the hazel eye section does not match the description of hazel eyes, as it is blue with central heterochromia (brown around the pupil). The hazel eye description says nothing about hazel eyes being blue in any way, so i trust this is a mistake that needs to be changed immediately, i propose one of the following pictures be shown in it's place as they match a golden light brown hazelnut colour:

"The origins are very obscure. The Bedouin Arabs, who were the original followers of Mohammed and responsible for the first islamic conquests in Syria, Palestine, and Persia, were a nomadic people who lived in tents. In the cities they conquered they began by converting old buildings, and christian churches became mosques; in damascus a pagan temple transformed into a Christian church was incorporated into the Great Mosque (706-15). The earliest and one of the most beautiful of islamic buildings is the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem, built as a sanctuary (not as a mosque)[there's some debate about this] on a circular plan (685-705, but much altered later, especially in 1561 when the exterior was cased in Persian tiles and the interior lined with marble). The first minarets were converted church towers in Syria, and that built a Kairouan, Tunisia (724-7), is modelled on such a tower. True to their nomadic origins the Umayyad rulers preferred desert residences to town palaces. Several survive in ruins - Qasr al-Hair (728-9); Mshatta near Amman, Jodania; and Qasr at-Tuba in the Wadi Ghadorf near Amman. In plan these groups of buildings were derived from Roman frontier stations. Both religious and secular buildings of the period incorporate elements which were to become distinguishing features of islamic architecture: The horseshoe arch, tunnel vaults of stone and brick, rich surface decoration in carved stone, mosaic, and painting. During the Umayyad period the mosque took its permanent architectural for, dictated by liturgical needs - minarets from which the faithful could be called to prayer; a wide courtyard with a central fountain for ablutions, with surrounding colonnades to give protection from the sun; a large praying chamber, marked externally by a dome (as a sign of importance) and internally by the mihrab or niche indicating the direction of Mecca, towards which the faithful must turn in prayer. The last survivor of the Umayyad dynasty became the founder of the Emirates at Cordoba in Spain, where the early style of Islamic architecture was brought to perfection in the Great Mosque (786-990)
Under the Abassids who surplanted the Umayyads in 750, Persian influence began to dominate the Islamic world. The main achievements in architecture were the foundation of the new capital at Baghdad, built on a circular plan (762-7, now largely destroyed) and, slightly later, the smaller city of Raqqa, Syria of which little survives except its richly decorated gateways. It was at this period that Islamic architecture began to depart radically from Hellenistic and Byzantine conventions. An elaborate court etiquette, derived from persia and contrary to Bedouin ideas of informality, was introduced, and palaces were designed for the new caliphs on more formal and grandiose lines, e.g. the palaces of Ukhaidir and Samarra in Iraq. These large buildings were run up very quickly; stone was abandoned in favour of brick and there was much use of decorative stucco. The main C9 achievements were the great mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia (836); the mosque of Bu Fatata, Susa, Tunisia (850-1); the Great Mosque of Samarra, Iraq with its strange ziggurat-like minaret (c850) and the very well preserved mosque of Inb Tulun, Cairo (876-7). Buidling materials were usually rough but dressed with intricate geometrical or floral surface decorations in painted stucco, mosaic, glazed tiles, or shallow relief carving. Local traditions influenced the decorative styles in various regions (See Indian pakistan, persian and turkish architecture)
''In the original nucleus of the Islamic world the most notable later mosques are those a Tabriz, Persia (1204), Cairo (Mosque of Sultan Barquq 1384) and Isfahan Persia (1585). Most of the earlier religious builings, including the Masjid-el-aksa and the dome of the rock in jerusalem, were also altered and more richly decorated in these centuries. In southern spain a local style of great oppulence was developed; it's principle monuments are the Giralda tower, Seville (1159) and the Alhambra (1309-54)",0

Edits in history of the tank

A while back you added some considerable information to the section /*Between the Wars*/, which was more in its place in the Tanks (1919-1939) article. I've moved/merged this information into the latter article and would appreciate it if you could look over both articles to see if nothing has been lost or inadvertely been duplicated?

Firstly, I edited a chapter of my Meltyukhov translation a couple of days ago, but lamentably after my last save the Word annaounced that the file was 'corrupt'. Problems emerged while I was trying to send it via mail, as the copy of text I tried to add from recovered version of this 'corrupt' file was declared to 'contain no data'. The same thing occured, as I tried to post the whole text into my wikipage. I don't know what to do about it, I actually need this text for preparing an article in wikipedia as well (rough notes on my page) .

Secondly, (another unpleasant news) 'our mutual friend' Deng has become active again! See his changes to WW2 Eastern front proposal page. 

(Is it necessary to add, that he is obviously trying to revive the old story of 'bad Germanns and goodd Soviets'? He replaced a paragraph on Vlasov etc with his version of the events (a rather belletristic 'improvement', BTW), and usual English with his understanding of the English grammar...)  - Talk

 Leading paragraphs for articles 

Hi SamClark, this is just a comment that was made to me, that I thought I would pass onto you, for you to think about and respond how you please. The leading paragrpahs in Global Justice, and your draft at User:Sam Clark/justice read like the introduction to an essay. Particularly the last sentences which say what the article will discuss. This is what I did when I created a few articles from scratch, mainly because the only type of writing I ever do is for essays. But a couple of people have commented that as an encyclopaedic article, the first section is more like a synopsis rather than an introduction, and would generally just sum up the points of the rest of the article.

For instance, instead of 
It considers the various ways in which justice has been understood, distinguishes two broad kinds of justice, and then describes several theories of justice under each of those two headings.
It could say something like:
There are various ways to understand justice, but generally you ca distinguish between two kinds of justice: distributive justice and retributive justice. Distributive justice is concerned with the proper distribution of good things while Retributive justice is concerned with the proper response to wrongdoing.

And then it would just go straight into the article. If you look at most of the long-standing and comprehensive articles that seems to be the way they are written. Cheers.  

 Heh - good point. In my case, it's being in the habit of writing lecture-notes, but the same point applies. I'll change. Thanks,  

 Rewrite of Justice 

I think it would be great to see the derivation of the word justice from the latin (not the french) etc and perhaps a section on history on how our understanding of the term has evolved (ie. what it meant in different times and different places). Justice is defintely a philosophical concept and so it is important to discuss the philosophical meanings and debates concerning justice, but it is also a political/judicial term as well as an everday term that people use and so it would be good to have all of this represented in the article eventually. I think stuff like this from the original article is very important: 
In most cases what one regards as """"just"""" (not necessarily meaning what is just) is determined by consulting established and agreeable principles, employing logic, or, natural law In specific systems justice is determined, by consulting a majority, or in social contexts where religion dominates, justice may be thought to require deference to religious texts or to spiritual guidance, under a monarchy or authoritarian state the ruler/s determined what was just and doled out justice. All of these determinants of justice have at times delivered particularlly dark periods of history where justice was seen to be absent. If a person lives under a specific set of laws in a country, concepts of """"justice"""" are often simply deferential to the existing law —the issuing of punitive reprimands for violations may be referred to as """"serving justice."""" In principle, this fits the general concept in that the individuals get what is supposedly due to them. Justice however, is a universal and absolute concept; laws, principles, religion, etc., are merely attempts to codify the concept  occasionally with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice.

"A typical anti-Ukrainian Russian imperialistic claim 

The current version of the introductory section contains at least one paragraph that is purported to make Ukraine look as a home of all sorts of people, except Ukrainians themselves. Here is what it says, as of today:

 Ethnic Ruthenians were frequently a rural people and often formed minorities in their own cities and towns. For example, Kiev in the 1920s was approximately 1/3 Jewish and 1/3 Russian, with the remaining third constituting ethnic Ukrainians, Poles, and Germans. A similar demographic history existed in Lviv with a majority Polish and Jewish population.

Am I the only Ukrainian editor who finds these kind of statements offensive? Not only these kinds of claims have absolutely no ground in the known Ukrainian historical facts, but they, in fact, repeat, almost word in word, the statements made by anti-Western anti-Ukrainian Putin propaganda!

I asked the editors to provide the citations justifying the obviously false claims in these paragraphs. My requests have been deleted and I has been told that they will block my Wikipedia account.

As I suspected, complete nonsense. Your statement is so silly that I can't begin to tell you how wrong it is. You said, """"You there presume that your not-yet-filed Arbcom case has been decided"""". I assure you that this was not the case - I would consider that to be a stupid assumption. I am not a stupid person. I would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part, and withdraw everything on this page based on your mind-reading trick.
You quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the """"lack the intellectual ability comment""""
By the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me, your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack. If it wasn't so silly I would spend time thinking more on it, which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack.
Here's a few points for you to think on.

WP:Civil, WP:AGF & WP:NPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.
Then let's consider the ArbCom an article. What then is this articles content?
Hmm, let's see … the ArbCom is an article, so what is the ArbCom made of? Why, members. So that means the content of the committee is it's members. So an election is a decision on the content of this article.
So.
Members are editors, so content is editors, so in order to write this article we must discuss the content.
We must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content.
You don't like that?
WP:Civil, WP:AGF & WP:NPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.
But ArbCom is not an article. It is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee.
We must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.
We cannot question articles about their content, nor can we ask the content questions, but we can ask the proposed contents of the ArbCom questions.
Is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to ArbCom membership? If you do not think so, how many of the present ArbCom do you consider stupid? Would a low intellect on ArbCom help or hinder? If there is evidence (a diff) of intellectual failings, does the candidate realise this failing? Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? The questions were politely put. They were challenging, and they were meant to be, and anyone in the community (which includes me) has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. There was no name calling, all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on ArbCom. They were not deferential. Which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed.
Your threats of blocks I regard as an attempt to bully. Do not try to bully me.
Finally I would contrast the participation of admin's in this ANI with the marshalling of forces which you participated in, and then came here.   """,0

"This is a farce: The Nervous Mermaid is wholly interested in Ralph Nader and has not commented on any other article in Wikipedia except for Seasons & a Muse, Inc, an article that has had only two contributors, one of whom, not coincidentally, is 76.166.123.129, who is often a commentator on the Ralph Nader article. Meanwhile, there's Telogen, who only comments on Ralph Nader and one other article, Jeanne Marie Spicuzza, an article which also happens to be visited extremely often by user 76.166.123.129.

The only evidence of conspiracy is that which you're creating. It appears there are several editors, myself included, who disagree with your position, so you're resorting to personal attacks.

Infoboxes have their limitations.  This is one of them.  Have another look at my post to the talk page; your input appears to be sincere yet also has missed nearly all of the referenced points I was making:
In the post-Reconstruction, pre-WWI United States, the """"N-word"""" was far less transgressive than it is today.
That particular word has undergone such a dramatic reduction in social acceptability that it must be presented within context, if at all.
This isn't because of the word's offensiveness to modern sensibilities per se; it's because twenty-first century readers would not understand its use as a nickname for a white man and would have no point of reference for how it would become a badge of honor to him.  Context must be provided or else it is shocking and misleading rather than informative.
It may not be possible or necessary to contextualize that moniker adequately within the bounds of WP:NPOV, specifically WP:UNDUE.  The nickname is a minor part of Pershing's life and career.  A similar nickname in Irving Berlin's biographical background has more than twice the returns on Google Books, yet is not mentioned in his Wikipedia biography.

 Documentingabuse 

Thatcher,

I would like to ask you how to correct a number of detrimental false impressions that you have left on the Checkuser for Documentingabuse. Excuse me I am still with a dynamic IP address only from the same ISP.

You have stated that I edited whilst logged out. If we look at the actual diffs, you will see that this is not true. I only made the account AFTER editing and so could not have logged in in the first place

I myself added blocked user  and
alleged """"death threat"""" canadian editor

That has now been resolved with an apology and removal from various pages but not all. To my knowledge you made no formal Checkuser and yet the page is left as if it to look it was.  I encourage you now to do so and correct or remove this.

You have had previous dealing with  and  over similar Japanese-Korean issues. I clearly state and stated that I am not Asian despite editing from Japan. I have since confirmed that Caspian blue does indeed have 'issue' in this area , this diff also shows the Caspian blue to Appletrees account transfer. The accusation by them would appear highly contrive to act as a disincentive against their position.

 has since removed the alleged sockpuppet of Dvarkal tag off my page and withdrawn the allegation about the Canadian ISP but I remain unable to edit from Documentingabuse except on my own talk page.

I do not wish to make another account because this will surely be used against me and more sock allegations made.
I wish to have the previous allegations removed as they are factually incorrect. The sequence shows I was not acting as a sockpuppet.

I have always made clear either by redirection or clear notices  which IP I was given, e.g. """"Please note that for accuracy, my host IP gives out dynamic IPs and so there is NO intent to act as a sockpuppet. I also have no intent of evading any block but just wish to continue documenting this case."""" """"  and yet this remains recorded as """"Confession of his sockpuppeting and block evasion"""" by Caspian blue.

I only create the user account to documenting the block revisions of the article, as I had to in order to be allowed, as I continued to have numerous other editors make identical revisions against me ... none of who would or were willing to discuss. . My position is frame by my response to what I have experience attempting to improve these contentious topics, here; . 

In order to communicate with Rlevse over this, I have made a new account Not-a-sock-just-for-rlevse.

 Napoleon Zervas 

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned down or destroyed. Furthermore, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region who took refuge in the Republic of Albania.

Maybe a """"purgatory in RC teaching"""" would be a good idea, maybe it would be a bad idea.  Right now, I'm just thinking about the audacious move, which I oppose for its own sake, other issues aside.  The move is a separate matter from the content, since everything about it was wrong.  As for you and I, I know we disagree on some things, but that's to be expected - people disagree.  In the end it probably makes a better article.  But neither you nor I have the desire to do anything disrespectful, audacious, or flagrantly inconsiderate.    

Well, two of our big things round these parts are Be Bold and Ignore all rules.  Which is to say, whether Abtract was bold and audacious or not, there's no sense stressing over spilt milk   we should make our decisions not based on the audaciousness of the action, but on the appropriateness of the outcome.

To have to pages is to avoid a content dispute that would be heated, but in which your POV would almost certainly wind up on the losing end.

Yep. LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). ) 
By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)   15",0

Kim, I do not see how you can say this unless you agree with Henry Ford that """"history is bunk.""""  Most people are interested in history, and there are even scientists who are interested in the history of their science.  That it confuses you does not mean (as I think is now evident) that it will confuse most readers of this encyclopedia.  They understand that things change.  They also understand that trends have beginnings.  It is simply meaningless to say """"the old definition is incorrect.""""  If you do not understand why, I urge you to read up on the philosophy of science - definitions are more or less useful.  It was that old definition that led to a line of inquiry that has led evolutionary scientists to more precise and more useful understandings of the process.  If anything, as educators we should show readers how scientists start with one formulation of natural selection and then refine it.  
You know, the fact that you reject Darwin's definition of natural selection does not mean natural selection and the theory of evolution are wrong.  On the contrary, it simply means that science has a history, that scientists debate and refine concepts which necessarily change over time.  Do you think this is a trivial point?  In the United States, at least, you are dead wrong.  If you are not from the US let me tell you, there is a huge """"creationist"""" movement which has, on numerous ocassions, had the theory of evolution banned from high schools.  And you should know that one """"argument"""" they make is that Darwin was - well, as you say, """"incorrect.""""  """"See!"""" they exclaim, """"even scientists say Darwin was wrong!  We should no longer teach evolution!""""  Obviously, they misunderstand the way science works.  They do not understand that scientists refine and develop theories without necessarily rejecting them.  I think scientists have an obligation to educate people about this.  Showing how scientists accept an idea, and then change its definition or conceptualization by refining it without repudiating it is the best way to accomplish this.    |  Talk 
You confuse hiding Darwin versus focusses on current usage first and add darwin's definitions in the history section.  
Okay, but with all due respect, you confuse starting with Darwin for focussing on Darwin.  They aren't the same.  There are two reasons for starting with Darwin: one, it is a reasonable starting point, two, whatever differences there are between you, Axel, Marco and others, or among different scientists who have published on natural selection, all can agree that Darwin introduced the idea.

While diglossia as a field of research or even the concept might have flowered long past Caldwell, its quite inconceivable that Caldwell would have been unaware of this diglossia.  Infact, in speaking about the difficulty that the untrained or sometimes even the trained Tamil(and I certainly and strongly feel that he is talking about people who have received their training in Tamil Nadu.  I dont think he would have based his views or book on somebody who learnt or spoke Tamil in say, Germany or France in the mid 19th century) faces, Caldwell is speaking about nothing but diglossia, maybe without putting it down in as many words.

Be that as it may, what studies in diglossia in Tamil over the last several decades would have done is merely deal with the 'problem' in greater detail and throw light on such things as the causes for diglossia, 'evolution', perpetuation etc., of this phenomenon over the centuries and other things of academic interest like that.

What I am trying to say is, while scientific interest and research into diglossia might be a development of the last few decades, 'diglossia'(in tamil) existed nonetheless, even before that.  And like I said, Caldwell has only touched upon it though not gone deeper into it to research the more intricate details of it.

Notwithstanding that, the fact remains that the ordinary Tamil, especially one without formal(or informal) training, is often at a loss to understand Classical tamil enough to fully appreciate its beauty.

so, imo, the lines that are already there should be retained as it is.  But, you should also(before those lines, preferably) make a mention of the diglossia that exists in Tamil, the different levels, the continuum etc., and then conclude that... """"....as a result of the said diglossia, the ordinary Tamil, sometimes even with formal training, is at a loss to understand the language of classical literature(or the other diglossic levels)""""

And, to answer Sundar's question as to whether (I feel) this is limited to just Tamil or is also a feature of other languages -

While I dont a 'professional grade' knowledge of any language, I've had formal schooling in both Kannada and Hindi.  And I've observed this feature in both languages, much more so in Kannada.  In Kannada, in fact, if you were to study the 'Mankutimmana Kagga'(written sometime in the 60s or 70s i guess) by D V Gundappa, the language used is somewhat in haLegannaDa style, though I would say, it doesnt 'sound' as haLe(old) as haLegannada.  I am able to understand this work for the most part except in some places where it gets a little too much for me and I might have to refer to the dictionary.

Any literature, regardless of when it was written, but written in pure haLegannada style, I would say, wouldnt make much sense to the untrained eye or ear.  

With Hindi, probably because the language is much younger than Kannada or Tamil, though I've observed a sort of diglossia, say in the language that Kabir employs, verses that of Munshi or someone,  Kabir is far more discernable to me than say the Kavirajamarga would be to me or probably Kural to you.

In general, I feel some degree of diglossia almost always exists in most languages(atleast Indian languages) in that, the lingo employed by news readers, say,(atleast in the good old 'Doordarshan only' days), is removed from the one you would hear on the street.  Talking of newsreaders and the lingo on street, I just remembered an interesting thing about the Kannada spoken by the people of South Kanara.  It is almost exactly like the one employed in the news or in formal documents, in that, they speak much the same way they and the rest of Karnataka would write.  I am not sure if there's a parallel to this in Tamil or any other language that I have any knowledge of.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

I believe the following description on the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_size is false: """"However, the larger area does not imply a better low-light sensitivity or higher signal-to-noise ratio. While the light collecting area is larger, this is canceled out by the fact that the same total light from the scene is spread out over a larger area, that is, the light flux per square mm is lower, for a fixed aperture diameter. Larger sensors can still be advantageous for low-light applications because typically lenses for them exist with larger apertures than are possible for smaller sensors.""""

The following was my attempt to correct this information:

""""A given lens will provide the same density of light on any sensor at a given aperture. For sensors with the same number of megapixels (MP), a large sensor will have proportionately larger pixels. The pixels on a 10 MP Full-Frame sensor will be more than twice as large as the pixels on an APS-C (2.3 times for Nikon, and 2.6 times for Canon). The larger pixel size is one of the reasons that full frame sensors typically have both superior sensitivity and reduced noise in low light in comparison to smaller sensors.  The smaller sensor is equivalent to a cropped section of the larger sensor but with smaller pixels, therefore much of the light from a full frame lens will fall off the edges of the smaller sensor and is """"wasted."""" Theoretically, a 10 MP (Canon) APS-C sensor should perform the same as a 26.3 MP full frame sensor, all other factors being equal.

Although a given lens will produce the same depth of field (DOF) regardless of the sensor, in practice DOF is also affected by the sensor size. This is because at a given focal length the photographer must stand further away from the subject in order to frame the same shot when using a camera with a smaller sensor. Since the DOF increases with the focal distance (distance between the lens and the subject), a photograph taken with an APS-C camera will have a deeper DOF than the identical photograph taken with a full frame camera using the same lens and aperture setting. The photographer can alternatively select a wider angle lens for the APS-C camera and stand at the same focal distance as with the full frame camera to frame the same shot, however the DOF will be affected in the exact same way since DOF also increases with wider angle (shorter focal length) lenses.""""

However it was deleted with no counter argument or explanation of the facts. I believe my description was clear, but I will leave the false information in place as I see no way to make the explanation any clearer than this.

Please let me know. Thank you.

  

As I pointed out on someone else's talk page, where you spammed this request:
It's not clear it's a notable talk show, and
It's not at all clear the show has a reputation for fact-checking.
Without both, it's only a reliable primary source for what Dr. Wood actually said, if that.  —   (talk) 

It's not hard to fact-check the fact that Dr. Wood's case went all the way to the Supreme Court.

That has nothing to do with it, nor is it notable.  Anyone can appeal their case to the Supreme Court (technically, request Supreme Court review, as an actual appeal to the Supreme Court can only be done on certain Constitutionally specified cases).  The Court let the Appealate Court decision (that there was no case) stand, with no dissenting justices.  —   (talk) 

Yes, anyone can try to appeal their case, but not all cases get appealed, in fact, very few cases get appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, because the Supreme Court only takes on the biggest and most important cases. In this scenario, her case was so solid and so backed by evidence, that it made it ALL THE WAY to the SUPREME COURT. 
To say that the only 9/11 research efforts ever to be filed in a court of law and make it to the Supreme Court are not notable, makes me question your integrity as a person. Amazing.
  
Ahem.  The Supreme Court did not """"take the case"""".  In fact, the Appealate Court ruled there was no potential case, and the Supreme Court did not hear the """"appeal"""".  —   (talk) 

There was a motion to dismiss by the defendents at the level of Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court upheld that motion. The case was dismissed at the level of the Supreme Court, regardless of whether or not the case was actually heard.   

(cite)?.  My recollection is that Appealate court accepted the motion to dismiss (or, possibly, rejected Federal jurisdiction against the defendants).  If there was a Supreme Court order, I'd like to see a pointer to it.  —   (talk)

I tried to personally change """"residential district"""" to """"Israeli settlement"""" in the article but an abuse filter prohibited me from doing so. What administrator implemented this filter, and can someone change this? The anonymous editor above is partially correct; while they are still residents, the area is an illegal Israeli settlement as it was built on land occupied after 1967 (namely the West Bank). This should be mentioned in the lead of the article; otherwise, the statement about Israeli settlements being illegal under international law seems like a non sequitur. Can someone please change this? 96.26.213.146  """,0

"Afghanistan is nation of Pashtuns 
Please do not try to put Pakistan above Afghanistan, as Afghanistan is the headquarters of all Pashtuns, regardless if the number of Pashtuns is lower than Pakistan. The Afghan Pashtuns are 100% real and authentic Pashtuns, as the Pakis are not. Most Paki Pashtuns speak mainly Urdu as their official language. Rahim Shah sings 5% in Pashto, while more than 95% in Punjabi, so he is not popular than Farhad Darya. Darya sings 50% in Pashto and 50% in other languages. Also, do not removed sources images because that violates the rules.",0

If you read the discussion above, the problem with most of this article is (was) that it classifies things as being anti-American when that's really just an opinion. Most of it was sourced with opinion pieces. Calling someone anti-American, and someone actually saying they are anti-American, are two different things. The opinions that people are anti-American, without them actually saying they're against America, don't belong in the article because they are not factual conclusions.  •✗/C • 10:51, 10 Apr 2008 (UTC)""",0
