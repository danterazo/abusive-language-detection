 Josephine Baker 

I'd like to ask that you review the talk portion of the sexuality section on Josephine Baker's page. My discussion went off on a tangent with Malik Shabazz when it really should have included you as well. The Jean Claude Baker book on Josephine Baker seems biased and unacceptable. For example, he states at the beginning that he """"hated her"""" and refers to himself eighteen times on the first page. Since he did not meet her until she was 52 it seems inappropriate to rely on his claims about her life when she was 20 or 30. The blanket statement """"Baker was bisexual,"""" written as if it indisputable, really has to go, don't you think? There is no evidence given except the claim of a fan who changed his name to hitch onto her celebrity. Doesn't this kind of TMZ gossip presented as fact diminish the biographies of people who have the courage to acknowledge their sexuality up front?209.212.5.67  """,0

 IMAGE DELETIONS 

Carnildo says you deleted two images from the article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Joseph_Cormier that were posted by another WikipediA Administrator http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Earl_Andrew. Is there a hierarchal structure system among Administrators so one can overrule another without discussion?

One image showed the subject of the article wearing the gag """"Fear of the Truth"""" over his mouth as he was beat up and removed from the Visitors Gallery of the Canadian House of Commons on the first day of televised debate in history. That would make it an image associated with history, in Canada at least.

Understanding WikipediA respects copyrite restrictions, the tag applied to the deleted images reads as follows:

Because the image is historically significant, the entire image is needed to identify the subject, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image. Low resolution?

The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original. Copies made from it will be of inferior quality, unsuitable for uses that would compete with any commercial purpose of the photograph. Purpose of use

Identification and critical commentary in the article, a subject of public interest. It makes a significant contribution to the user's understanding of the article, which could not practically be conveyed by words alone. The image is placed next to the associated material discussing the work, to show the primary visual image associated with the work, and to help the user quickly identify the work and know they have found what they are looking for. Replaceable?

Because the image depicts a non-reproducible historic event, there is almost certainly no free equivalent. Any substitute that is not a derivative work would fail to convey the meaning intended, would tarnish or misrepresent its image, or would fail its purpose of identification or commentary. Other information Use of the historic image in the article complies with Wikipedia non-free content policy and fair use under United States copyright law as described above. The image meets general Wikipedia content requirements and is encyclopaedic.

It will take some time before the Article is so widely known by the public, there is a 0% probability any newspaper will want to claim copyvio considering the subject.

Will you please undo what you did until there is a free and fair discussion by users? If there is any tag that could be associated to the disputed images to stimulate discussion, do that. The Editors of the Ottawa Citizen have been aware of its images on the Article since they were posted by Earl Andrew.

Public Statement by Mark Bellinghaus regarding the bias edits and tries to further slander him and his colleagues

You continue to edit out three important articles that were printed and published in the Los Angeles Times. Why? Instead you are pushing for a blog post which is absolute nonsense. You are adding a two piece article which is a one sided attack on me, Mark Bellinghaus. I have never had a 'dispute' with Brandon James, since I have not contacted him, as he claimed in the article published by the OC Register. They also published other lies, which since have been removed due to my protest and conversation with their attorney. Please edit in good faith and stick to the truth. I will file a protest with Wikipedia, because what is happening is a continuation of the planned out in detail slander, character defamation and assassination by a small group of people who are obviously connected to and behind the fraud crimes, the criminal hoaxes which we exposed and debunked. This article is literally a stage for book projects such as June DiMaggio's and Jeanne Carmen's.

Maybe the time has come that we must also expose the real person behind Delicious carbuncle?!

Again, I knew that I would become the target of the criminals who I stopped screwing over the general public with their gimmicks, attached to the legacy of Marilyn Monroe. But I will use my clear and given right to defend what we, three people who did care and worked for this for the past three years have achieved and succeeded with.

The LA TIMES articles must be added to this article, and the CITIZEN is a dead blog, which was a favor/favour  posted by a friend, this is how this lady introduced herself to me on the phone when she called me up, of Kenneth Knoll, the friend and manager of the June DiMaggio book project. She quoted me out of context and she admitted to me that she is NOT a press agency or journalist.

Regarding the Brandon James claims which you willingly added. I have never spoken to Brandon James, ever since I was introduced to him and his mother in 2005. He followed me to every blog, every website. Attacked us, hidden behind monikers.

What is happening here right now is an example of some bias people who have created this to destroy our credibility.

It is a sad act of cutting off our freedom of speech and also trying to diminish our success in terms of the fraud exposures. Who is behind this? We do know exactly who is and we already have taken action.

And that exposure is way more interesting than anything we have taken on in the past.

It has also to do with cyber bullying, since I am being portrayed as a monster. I am being compared to Charles Manson and Berkowitz and that website was posted anonymously in Malaysia. These people want me to go the Megan Meier way. They have already told me to kill myself. Not once, but twice. They have called me a 'pedophile' and other insults. They have claimed that I made bomb threats when I have never ever threatened anyone. At all. I have never extorted anyone. You people, hiding behind your funny and also so believable names, you know why you are doing this and why you are using Wikipedia, to destroy my name, completely. When I protested on the 45th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death, outside the chapel, I had my reason. Three people were threatened and harassed by the 'Monroe 6 Version 2007' gang of people who threatened me to 'come to my home, tie me on a chair, duct tape me and steal my collection. They were not shy to even include the AIDS infected blood by one of the members. One of the people who is part of this group is now hiding behind this Wikipedia moniker and we positively have received confirmation, that this female from Canada, a woman which I have never met in personis part of this gang of super obsessive fans who on top of this also have created, have thought out these many frauds, hoaxes, crimes.

I am asking you, that if you decide to keep this site up and going, NOT to use it to destroy our success in terms of our exposures. I never thought that the power of blog could bring down the biggest exhibition fraud in history, but it did.

Success, so simple created and achieved naturally delivers a lot of haters. Jealousy is one thing, but facts and achievements are another.

It is one thing to post hateful comments about someone and to claim that 'Mark Bellinghaus mentally ill' and other worse things, and to post these hater attacks with monikers such as all of these people do itin known Lori Drew manner. But it is unfair and it is also liable to post lies on a website, which is nothing else than the revenge of a group",0

A reply to the argument that Benazir Bhutto mispoke

Benazir was a highly intelligent, highly educated and ex-prime minister.  She is not George Bush.  She does not mispeak.  This is the biggest thing since watergate.  The proof that this is a cover up is shown by the following facts:

i) the experienced reporter David Frost who was interviewing Benazir when she """"slipped out"""" the fact that Bin Laden was murdered did not follow up on it.  In fact he looked palpably irritated and wondering quite how to paper over the issue.  He is in on the game, clearly.  If he was not in on the game then he would have pinned her down on this sensational bit of news.  

ii) Benazir was murdered in a wet job (this is a technical term) about a month after she mentioned that Omar Sheikh (note the triangle of first letters in history) was involved in Bin Laden's assasination.

iii) Nobody in the world's media picked up on a story that Bin Laden was murdered.

So blanket world media silence on the possibility of Bin Laden being dead.  I kinda have a source inside who confirms this.  Acutally it was years ago and not Omar Sheikh, but letters in names can sometimes be telling three times.""",0

 Codes and """"minor"""" state 

Please stop Since there is no definition of a """"minor"""" state, there is no need to put it there. Is Algeria """"minor?"""" Iran? It's a nonsense phrase, so it should be deleted. As for making """"MA"""" a country code for Western Sahara, it's not. MA is a code for Morocco, and so it is in Morocco's infobox. EH was created for Western Sahara, so that is its country code. As far as the territory being occupied, this is a clear fact and the position of the United Nations; it is also mentioned in the article in other places. -❤T☮C☺M☯ 
It does not need a definition to be in the article. A minor state is used as opposed to super-power states, permanent members of the security council, ... etc. As to the EH domain, it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for WS but it is not assigned, """".MA"""" being the one used in the territory. The same thing applies for the currency, the MAD is the currency of Morocco, but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. The same thing goes for the IAC 212, the Time zone +0 UTC, etc. They are the ones used in the territory. These things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. As to your ridiculous claim of the UN considering the territory as occupied, I already explained to you the difference between a UN position through the security council that is reiterated again and again, and a voting poll in 1979 of the Algerian-Cuban drafted document, that has no obligation on the UN. The """"Zionism=Racism"""" example is the brightest one for you to understand it. I will revert to the version that was in use before the anon IP started this mess.  
It does Since """"minor states"""" doesn't mean anything, you can't use it in this article; it's nonsense. What states that """".ma"""" is being used in the territory? Do you have any evidence of this at all? The same thing does not apply to currency, since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. To ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which top-level domain name has been assigned to the region; the former is defined entirely by usage, the latter is defined entirely by standards. Western Sahara is clearly occupied, as the article itself still states; I'm not going through this with you again. -❤T☮C☺M☯ 
 Ah we're back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. Minor states is indeed a value judgement - although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena (Algeria is not a big newsmaker per se). But in the interest of neutrality, merely noting """"African, Asian, and Latin American"""" states seems reasonable. At the same time, if Koavf gets to bleat on about minor, it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. Same standards on language. (  )
 Evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in Western Sahara provinces using .ma. It is trivially easy to find that. Koavf's immature partisanship notwithstanding. (  )
What is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in Western Sahara? « D. Trebbien (talk) 23:40 2008 May 5 (UTC)
 Good question. Since effectively all internet service to the Western Sahara is via Maroc Telecom or other Moroccan operators, one would expect that most servers would be located in Moroccan territory (ex-WS provinces), largely in the Casa-Rabat area. Technically I am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located (versus the service). Presumably the Regional Investment Office of Laayoune (http://www.laayouneinvest.ma/fr/index.asp) may have its server physically in Laayoune. Other similar offices may also. It strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code, most sites use the Moroccan address (.ma). Polisario partisans may not like that, but its effective reality. (  )

i see youve redirected  the clairsentience article.... let me ask....what was the point of the weeks of discussions and rewrites if you guys were going to redirect it anyway....you should have told me t get lost out of here...... what was the point of it all?  why did i listen to you ? at all?  why did i remove all personal references?  why did i reference and source all of my matereal diligently and in great detail ?  why did i edit and re edit for style and content ?  why did i make additional references to religios , anthropological ,socialogical , philosophical ,medical , physics , chemistry , botany , mental health etc  so that all views were included and respected?  why did i fulfill all of the above hurdles and hoops to fulfill wikpedia formatting and guidlines for you too to delete months of hard work and effort.  your actions are without integrity or honour .....

Hi ..... whoever removed the clairsentience article and made it redirect ... can you please try and respect that the article that was there had evolved over a couple of months of discussion and many rewrites and multiple edits which involved much discussion over a long period......
.........i could delete this clairvoyance article.... but i wont because revert and delete wars then stupidly take place   which is a real shame when a library becomes a bar room brawl......

He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views.

"list of surgeons 
 Recently, the list of surgeons has been removed by  without discussion or note in these talk pages, with the claim that it is promotional. I disagree with the characterization of the physician list. I do not believe it promotes any given surgeon when all the major such surgeons are listed. In this context I do not believe this list is at all promotional. Those surgeons hardly need promotion, when their waiting lists are already six months or more deep. I also believe it is important to list these people so that nobody ever gets the misimpression that such surgery is performed primarily by anyone other than reputable, accredited plastic surgeons who are members of the ASPS and other relevant organizations. In this specific case, I also believe that it is important to humanize the existence of this surgery with the names of its actual practitioners. Let us not disappear the FFS surgeons to an anonymous status, when the work they do is so vitally important to its recipients. Removal of the surgeon list also decreases the verifiability of this article's contents. (That is another matter which should be addressed - this article needs some reference citations at its end.) There may be another reasons that the list of names should be maintained. Please feel free to add to the list.

Thanks for the reply – my biggest issue at the moment is whether to include """"sales figures"""" for earlier years... as far as I know, there were no published end of year sales figures before 1994, and the sales published at the time for 1994 to 1996 have since been discredited and revised, so are basically worthless. The figures currently quoted in the articles up to 1996 are usually """"estimates"""" that have been taken from various charts message boards, calculated by enthusiasts from officially published yearly sales figures per artist (i.e. sales could be made up of one or more singles or albums, and estimating what percentage of sales were assigned to each record). As these are completely unofficial and unverifiable, I am thinking to remove them altogether or at least add a note that all figures are unofficial and estimated. In any case I don't think most people are interested in how many records the 37th best selling album of 1987 sold that year – it makes more sense to me to concentrate efforts into keeping List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom up to date.

You raise several interesting points.

On the matter of plagiarism in general: Yes, you're right; if a Wikipedia page is remarkably similar to a page elsewhere, that doesn't mean that the WP page plagiarized the other: it could have been the other way around, or something more complex may have happened.

On this page: Its history shows an almost uninterrupted growth to this state, before the trimming started. I haven't examined the growth, but yes, gradual growth (as opposed to sudden jumps in size) suggests that the editorial work went on here. So perhaps I was too hasty.

Here is Graham's page about himself. I now notice that it says at its foot Excerpt from Gallery Press Release, 2008. So it's possible that it copied the press release which itself was a copy of the WP article.

So maybe I have an """"overly critical attitude"""". But if so, it's an overly critical attitude toward the editing, not Graham's work. (I've seen some of his early work from Beyond Caring and think it's very good; I know little about his other work.)

Why the apparent concentration on Japan? First, it's hardly a concentration; it's simply the addition of a sourced fact. And, if you're interested, here's how it came about. Having created Category:Photography in Japan, I populated it. Racking my brain for non-Japanese photographers who'd done a significant amount of work in Japan was a pleasant activity for a commuter trip or three; I also emailed a couple of friends more knowledgable about the matter than I am. Graham's name came up, either to one of them or to me. I was certain that he'd done work in Japan so I put this in  in accordance with WP policy, backing up the assertion with a reliable source. 

This was a contribution of time and energy, though admittedly a tiny one. Graham's work seems to have many admirers. I was hoping and expecting that among themselves they'd rebuild the article. I'd be willing to help with this. While not working on Graham's article, I've been working on articles about other photographers.

So let's turn back the clock to September 2008, before the cuts. Here's a paragraph:

Graham was the first photographer to combine the sensibility of contemporary colour photography with classic British social documentary. In 1981/2 he made A1—The Great North Road, a book of 40 colour photographs taken along the length of the British A1 road, which had a transformative effect on the black and white tradition that had dominated British art photography till that point. This work, along with Graham's later photographs of the 1980s -  the colour images of unemployment offices in Beyond Caring (1984-85), and the sectarian marked landscape of Northern Ireland Troubled Land (1984-86) - were pivotal in reinvigorating and expanding this area of photography, by both broadening it's visual language, and questioning our notions of what such photography could say, be, or look like. Photographers like Martin Parr made the switch to colour soon after, and a new school of British Photography evolved with the subsequent colour work of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, Nick Waplington, etc.

Let's suppose for a minute that this is legitimate WP text, and not ripped off from somewhere else. Its content is a mixture of the easily verifiable and the arguable. Was he the first photographer to make this combination? Did this one book have a transformative effect? Why """"British art photography"""" (my emphasis)? How were they """"pivotal""""? This stuff would have to be sourced. (Yes, writing for WP is a bitch.)

Backing for some and perhaps even all of this is probably within Williams' text for How We Are and Mellor's for No Such Thing as Society. Do you have either of these?    """,0

WHY the King JAMES ONLY MOVEMENT rejects modern translations

Here is what was written:

""""In the modern period, the King-James-Only movement is opposed to new translations precisely because they're officially-endorsed by """"mainstream"""" Protestant denominations"""".

reply:
You would have to prove that. You would have to show direct quotes, direct cause and effect between the 1. rejection by KJVO (Abreviated as KJVO on this page for the sake of brevity) of the modern versions 2. their own explanations of their rejections of modern versions BECAUSE they are officially endorsed by """"mainstream"""" Protestant denominations. 

However, even if you could find such explanations in passing, the reason why KJVOs reject Modern versions is because the Modern Versions are innacurate, NOT because the official versions are endorsed by """"mainstream"""" Protestant denominations. Most KJVOs would not care who endorsed a particular version, if their own conclusions were that the Version in question were accurate. Therefore to suggest that

""""In the modern period, the King-James-Only movement is opposed to new translations precisely because they're officially-endorsed by """"mainstream"""" Protestant denominations"""".

implies a cause and effect relationship between the conclusions of the KJVOs and the basis upon which that reasoning was made, which is faulty. Theo5""",0

 To be honest, I think that this is a fair comment. Accordingly, (and as this is a much debated article), I would like to propose this revised opening paragraph:
The terms Old Style (or O.S.) and New Style (or N.S.) are used in English language historical studies to indicate that the dating system used in the source material is one or other of the (historic) methods for determining the day on which the year starts. In the Old Style dating, the year began on 25 March, whereas in the New Style it began on 1 January.Death warrant of Charles I web page of the UK National Archives A demonstration of New Style meaning Julian calendar with a start of year adjustment. Additionally (more so in other parts of the world), the terms are used to indicate the change from the historic calendar [for example, the Julian calendar in Europe and the Americas] to the (modern) Gregorian calendar.The October (November) Revolution Britannica encyclopaedia, A demonstration of New Style meaning the Gregorian calendar.Stockton, J.R. Date Miscellany I: The Old and New Styles """"The terms 'Old Style' and 'New Style' are now commonly used for both the 'Start of Year' and 'Leap Year' [(Gregorian calendar)] changes (England & Wales: both in 1752; Scotland: 1600, 1752). I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March 25th to January 1); and that the 'Leap Year'  change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.""""Spathaky, Mike Old Style New Style dates and the change to the Gregorian calendar. """"increasingly parish registers, in addition to a new year heading after 24th March showing, for example '1733', had another heading at the end of the following December indicating '1733/4'. This showed where the New Style 1734 started even though the Old Style 1733 continued until 24th March. .. We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Old or the New Style reckoning. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 O.S. (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6. The hyphen (1745-6) is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time.""""

 Deleting """"Future World Music"""" Article 

Hi,
Sorry to disturb,
It's just I'm not fimiliar with all the precedures of writnig an article

Now,
I opened Future world music official website  and found some information about the movies they made songs for
So, I just typed thier names in this article
Then, I found some info about Future World Music in the same site  so, yes, I admit, I copied it but it was a couple of sentences only!!
At last, I havent finished the article yet, and was planning to continue to inhance it and adding the references """"The official site""""

So, please, what's wrong??
And, how to avoid that again for this exact article??
What should I do to make it accepted??

You, like 'Dodo', are wrong.  Notice that 'Dodo' hasn't bothered to EXPLAIN, in  detail, his actions.  This is quite revealing!  He must know that I am a 'new' user:  Only on for about two weeks.  Logic suggests that he should, carefully, EXPLAIN why he did something like deleting my posts, repeatedly, without even as much as asking the community.  After all, why should he be RUDE, as he has been, when he cannot claim that I 'should know' not merely what the rules say, but also the way they are followed.  Well, the simple answer may be that he does this kind of thing a lot:  He may ORIGINALLY have been respectful, but maybe he's developed a practice of 'drive-by-edits'.  He seems to have that reputation!  But as tempting as it may be to assert that, I think his actions are far more detailed and specific, and malicious:  His pattern of deletion of my posts is to delete ALL ALL ALL of my posts, not merely some fraction that (he would argue) violates some rule. So, the 'rule' (actually, the practice) he seems to be showing is this:  """"Do not allow James Dalton Bell to post ANYTHING, on any article, and certainly not on 'jim bell'.""""  Will 'Dodo' deny this? So far, he's avoided commenting!  'Dodo' seems to do this by simply finding SOME reason to dislike my post (even just a small part of it, though he doesn't say), and then use this to 'justify' deleting everything.  The best explanation, I  think, is that somebody has put him up to it, and he wasn't careful enough to cover his tracks.  And, a few other non-thinkers back him up.  (Is that called 'sock puppetry' or 'meat puppetry'?)     """,0

The assertion that Holodomor is a term used exclusively by """"extremists"""" is just absurd given the academic use of the term in the world. The arguments presented on this discussion page about it only coming to use in 1988 are just as weak, considering the word """"Holocaust"""" wasn't used in Russia until the 1990s - would someone make the claim that the .ru wiki not have a Holocaust page? Terms become more popular, it's a given, its the evolution of language and the globalization and linguistic transcendence of terminology. TFD, in my opinion, is just trying to ruffle feathers and vex users here, there is no way his claims can be taken seriously, he has no once backed up his ridiculous claims of extremism and that it is a fringe word in academics. You see Ukrainian historians and academics in the diaspora use it more than others not due to the fact Ukrainian historians do most of the research in this field, just as Jewish historians have dominated Holocaust historiography, Americans American historiography, etc. To write off respected historical literature as """"nationalism"""" or even worse """"extremism"""" serves as nothing more than provocation, not legitimate deliberation.

Speedy deletion of Tahsis claus
 A tag has been placed on Tahsis claus requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Not everyone believes this crap, copied from AN/I
I do not know either John254 or Kristin Erikson and recently stumbled across this. But, I have to say this looks like a witch hunt with evidence that wouldn't even hold up as circumstantial. They can't prove they're not socks, so they must be. And any evidence to the contrary is more proof because it must have been deliberately planted. If we ban then and they drown, then they must have been innocent after all. Personally, I've been editing Wikipedia since the beginning (late 2001), both as an IP user and with an account that I have abandoned, so I fully understand KE appearing on Wikipedia knowing more than you think a new user """"""""should"""". I would bet that the vast majority (like 99%) of users spend some time editing as an IP user before they create an account  the only question is how long they spend that way. It looks like KE didn't bother creating an account until she found a need to do so. That not only is not wrong, it should be encouraged.
Like KE, I have also edited extensively as an IP. For the most part, I found no reason to create an account, but I created a new account recently with my real name and, of course, my new account appeared to be an expert about Wikipedia immediately. Like KE, I also dive deeply into things. Were you to accuse me of being John254's sock puppet, I would do the same that she did  dig into his edit history and compare it to mine to look for evidence to prove my innocence. Most of the contributors here have dug into KE's edit history and now may well know more about it than she does  are you therefore sock puppets too?
Suggesting that defending herself with evidence, against people who are accusing her with flimsy evidence, is ridiculous. And, to argue that she would have deliberately created arguments with herself and other contrary evidence, over a long period of time, just in case anybody ever complained is hard to believe.
At best, the evidence here looks like collusion, not sock puppetry, and I don't even see that. But, even so, there is no rule against collusion on Wikipedia. And we see it all the time, with people cooperating on edits. I personally have emailed people I know to suggest that they edit pages in which I had an interest. Doing so does not make them my sock puppet or vice versa, whether they agree with me or disagree with me. 
To me, this flimsy house of cards rush to judgment and assumption of guilt represents the very worst of Wikipedia, and I think that even if it turns out that they are witches (uh, sock puppets). And I, personally, do not believe it to be true after reading this and the information on KE's page.

 Adaptively Reused churches and Former churches 

Hi Bencherlite, 
I've distinguished """"Adaptively Reused churches"""" from """"Former churches"""" because former churches could refer to any church building no longer used as a church, which would include demolition, closure, abandonment, ruin, etc. Adaptively Reused is an historic preservation / architectural conservation term for the reuse of a structure. For churches, this would include continuation as a church but for a different Christian denomination. Hope this clarifies that neither category is really a subcategory of each other, although they do heavily overlap. 
I believe some mistake were made. Thank you for catching the St. Cross and Hove articles

Thank you for your message and kind words; they're very much appreciated!   
Thank you also for the correction you're suggesting. I will look into the sources I used for the Planxty reunion dates and locations, and then update this section later on. Normally, I would do this straight away but I am quite busy at the moment and will be for the next few days. However, please know that I will definitely aim to fix this if I can, as I am always striving to ensure there is a third-party source for everything I contribute to the encyclopaedia. Of course, if some of these 3rd-party sources are wrong, then it's going to be tricky!
I also notice that you are a brand new user, who has made your first edit today, and to my user page! So, a very warm welcome to you and I hope you will enjoy your time here, either as a reader or maybe also as a contributing editor. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if your user and/or talk pages get supdated very soon with a 'Welcome' message from editors who like to take 'newbies' (= newcomers) under their wings.  
But if you look at my user page, you will see that I collected a lot of links to Wikipedia articles that provide details about editorial guidelines, such as the 'Manual Of Style' (Wiki:MOS). May I also suggest that, if you want some help in getting started as an editor, you can ask me and I will edit a few pointers in your own user- and talk-pages.

Finally, although I made quite a few changes to the 'Planxty' article (and especially to the 'Andy Irvine (musician)' article), one of the essential principles of our encyclopaedia is that these articles do not 'belong' to any one editor: we all contribute what we can without any article ever becoming 'mine'. In my case, I just happen to have been a Planxty (and Irvine) fan  for a long time and had kept a lot of reference material (mainly my collection of folk music magazines) that proved very useful to update the articles. I am still working on the Irvine article and the next tasks will be to create related articles for some of the albums.

"The Reality of the Wikipedia
It is clear that the worst proclaimed by the opponents of the Wikipedia is true.

That it is more interested in appeasing the egos of those in charge than pursuing the concept of dispassionate information.

When a female editor is able to suppress the revelation of a complete quote, which refutes her desire that only two words of that same quote were true, because a male editor is too infatuated to reject her perversion of the truth, then the Wikipedia has rejected ANY pretense to being more than what it is, which isn't much.

Thus my withdrawal from editing.

 Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 

Hey there! I created an article for Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 and I was wondering if you could help me out by verifying the translations of the rules I made from a document posted on LTV's website . I noticed on your user page that you have written that you are fluent in Latvian so if you have the time I would appreciate your help! My main concern is that I believe they wrote that they will select ten artists and songs to compete in this national final, but during their description of the shows, I'm not sure I understood how they will select only four entries for the final during the preceding shows.   
I haven't spoken/read/written Latvian (I mostly spoke Czech at home even when I lived in Latvia) in a pretty long time so I'm a bit rusty, so don't hold it against me if I misinterpreted, but here's what I got out of the rules. The first semi-final is non-elimination and just supposed to introduce the songs to the audience. In the second and third semi-finals, two songs are eliminated in each show,",0

The Catholic Church example is a good one, but I'd like to point out several key distinctions. First off, its an old enough institution that a separate History of the Catholic Church article exists, which makes the main article in reality The current status of the Catholic Church or maybe A summary of the Catholic Church, this is not the case for the NRA. We have a single article that is trying to address its entire history along with its cumulative activities, so the Lead needs to reflect that. Second, with all of the various controversy involving the Church, none of it mentioned until the last paragraph. Third, it's Lead 1st sentence is fairly generic simply stating that its the largest organization of its type and how many members it has. I would be fine with something similar, """"The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization with 5 million members."""" But quite frankly, that seems too simplistic and not terribly descriptive or informative.

Furthermore, if we take a clinical look at what they do today, its a variety of things that range from publishing and multi-media (television, internet, etc.) to training and certification programs to historical preservation along with lobbying and other political activities. So to describe the organization in the 1st sentence using any kind of phrase that includes """"gun control"""", gun rights"""", or the like is just bad writing and purposely ignoring significant parts of the article, hence my original suggestion for the Lead first sentence. At the very least, I don't see why the first sentence can't just be generically descriptive. Maybe something like, """"The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves as an advocate for firearm related issues and activities. Originally founded in 1871 in New York by journal editor William Conant Church and General George Wood Wingate to promote marksmanship within the United States military, the organization has gone through several transformations as well as expanded its purpose and goals. In the 21st century, it has become one of the largest and most influential lobbyist groups in Washington D.C. as well as a large, multi-title magazine publisher, an advocate for hunters, outdoorsmen, and the , and one of the largest firearm training and certification program operators in the U.S.""""

That said, I will try to find other examples, but given this list (:Category:501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations) it does not seem difficult to find an article with a Lead first sentence like I've described. By the way, I'm advocating for a rewrite of the ENTIRE WP:Lead, not just the 1st sentence. I think that Policy is fairly clear, but IMO to adhere to it properly in this case Editor's need, to quote the WP:Lead page, a specialized understanding of the subject in order to write it in a NPOV manner that a non-specialist will understand.

Rock or pop?
I know it says rock and roll here, but the red album really does sound very teeny-popish. My music collection only has room for single genres (as in rock or pop, not rock/pop), so which one is it really?  

It's rock  

Actully, it is pop not rock. I aggree with  that it sounds very teeny-popish. Rock and roll is the same thing as rock. I think a lot of people shorten it as it sounds a bit cooler.  | I will respond.  

 Many problems 

In addition to three items I tagged as  that appear to contradict what I can verify about the album, the table smacks of OR, and even then, some of the info in the table is incorrect.

As far as I can determine, both 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 were compiled by Allan Steckler, an employee of ABKCO (Allen Klein's company), which at that time was managing Apple Records in the United States. The Beatles had no involvement whatsoever with any aspect of the albums. Indeed, they came out in the United States about two weeks before their UK release. Also, the two albums were compiled, at least in part, as a response to a heavily promoted bootleg, The Beatles Alpha Omega, a 4-record, 4-tape set that came out in 1972 and was even advertised on television in the U.S.; the boot's availabiliy made the point that there was no true """"greatest hits"""" collection of the Beatles available in America at that time.  

 Choice of the colour red 

I have removed the claim that the Beatles chose the colour red for this album to show support for Liverpool F.C. Aside from the fact the other album is blue so we might as well suggest that indicates that they must be Evertonians, it's unsourced and extremely unlikely to be true. There has been a request for a source and none has been provided. In fact, there is no source for the claim that the Beatles helped select the tracks or helped with the album design at all (I seem to remember reading that McCartney did but not the others, though they may have done I suppose). Forgive me if I am wrong, but the suggestion that the Beatles picked red to show support for LFC sounds as though it's been made up by a Liverpool fan who either assumes this is the case or would like others to think it is. Some Liverpool fans like to proclaim that the Beatles were keen Liverpool supporters when in fact there is no evidence for this and almost certainly no truth to in it whatsover, and it's interesting that the contributer in question did not go over to 1967-1970 to make any similar reference to the choice of the colour blue indicating the Beatles' affection for Everton FC. Fact is, only one of the Beatles were even remotely interested in football (McCartney) and strictly speaking, he is an Evertonian (although he maintains he supports both clubs). Ringo, according to the Guardian, is an Arsenal fan. Neither George or John had any interest in football whatsoever and it is unknown which if any team they favoured, even there families don't know, although Harrison did seem to imply once that he supported Tranmere Rovers rather than Everton or Liverpool (Lennon added a Liverpool player, Albert Stubbins, to the Sgt. Pepper cover but later said he only did so because he knew he was his father's favourite player and that he himself actually knew nothing about Stubbs). There is a remote possibility that if the group were involved in the album's design that they may have chose red and blue in reference to the two Merseyside football clubs, but if it is so there should be a source for this and it should be made clear that this was not a show of support for one club over the other, which gives a false impression (whether intended or not).  

 I agree.  | I will respond.  

 Unauthorized Beatles compilations before """"1962-1966"""" 

Hi, anonymous user here. I found out about a 4-LP set called """"Alpha Omega"""" that was a Beatles compilation sold through infomercials back in 1972 that supposedly got EMI to compile the hits onto """"1962-1966"""" and """"1967-1970"""".

That quote discusses what happens to the penis after circumcision, which is not what the article is about. The sentence may use the word """"foreskin"""" but it is clearly a quote that is directly related to circumcision, rather than the foreskin, thus it is off-topic, and does not belong in the article. The only part of the sentence directly related to the foreskin is """"nerve endings in the foreskin,"""" and that section by itself doesn't add much to the article.

Allowing material that discusses what happens to the penis after the foreskin is removed would allow the entire Sexual effects of circumcision and Medical analysis of circumcision articles to be copied to Foreskin. When taken to this extreme, it's quite evident that discussing what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed is beyond the scope of this article. If readers wish to learn about what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed, there are plenty of circumcision-related pages that are directly related to that topic on wikipedia, and we already link to them from the Foreskin article.

It appears that the article is being used as a soapbox for discussing circumcision because of the number of sentences devoted to circumcision in the article. If it was just one or two sentences, I would not have a basis for making this accusation, but as we can see from this diff (your revert conveniently shows all three of my edits, so I'm using that rather than listing them individually), the amount of off-topic text devoted to circumcision is substantial.

Thanks for continuing our discussion, I think we're getting somewhere again.

 one word 

I want the article to be accurate and to be without grammatical errors. 

I tried to change """"forced into sexual slavery involved in prostitution """" to """"forced into sexual slavery or involved in prostitution """"  As the article has many references to the fact that there were also Japanese prostitutes acting as comfort women ie. involved in prostitution, not sex slaves, it seems accurate to state that some were forced into slavery while others were involved in prostitution. 

We seem to have had this discussion before, and considering that it is a minor change, this should be easy to change. The article makes it clear that the comfort women were made up of both groups, if someone wants to give some figures relating to the numbers in each group, then it would be great.

As it stands the article is highly flawed.

Anyone care to make a suggestion as to how it can be changed in a manner that everyone will approve of?

 Some historical references to the story of the Janjua Rajputs / sitush stop fucking with our article you gay hindu  

'Some historical references to the story of the Janjua Rajputs...'Bold text.
Predating all that is related below, the Pandava ancestors of Janjuas were known historically for the great Mahabharata war in which Arjuna and his brothers were victorious after huge losses on both sides.

""""The Janjua Rajputs possess a proud Martial reputation and rank very highly as the aristocracy of the Salt Range. Their pride in their ancestry is renowned and are always addressed by their ancestral title of Raja."""" (Rawalpindi District Gazetteer Robertson, reprint 2001, Lahore, p105)

""""Their (Janjuas) exploits and reputation has earned them the regard as the most Valiant Kshatriyas (warlords) in the Punjab."""" (History of Mediaeval Hindu India by Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya, Cosmo Publ. 1979, p129) """"The tribal system of loyalty to the clan is still adhered, and they tend to only align with other tribes of equally high social rank and reputation."""" (The Aftermath of Partition in South Asia Gyanes Kudaisya, London 2000, p207) “The great Janjua tribe have retained their pride of lineage and their Rájput title, and can be ranked as Míán Sáhu or first class Rájpúts...physically well-looking, with fine hands and feet; much given to military service, especially in the cavalry;...poor agriculturists, with great pride of race and are always addressed as Raja” (Panjab Castes - Sir Denzil Ibbetson, reprint Delhi 2002, p149, p154)
""""The Janjua are famed as a restless and warlike Muslim Rājput tribe."""" (Imperial Gazetteer of Kashmir and Jammu, Sang e Meel, reprint 2002, p9, p34) and are """"doubtless pure Rājputs"""".(Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 14, p152) & (The Indian Village Community by Baden Henry Baden-Powell, Adamant Media Corp. 2005, p97) The Janjuas Rajputs have been recognised in Punjabi history as a 'Martial clan' and the British also viewed them as excellent soldiers and distinguished them from other tribes as""""other tribes no way superior to them in courage or military skill"""". ('Punjab Chiefs' L.H.Griffin, 1909 Lahore, p215-7}. .
The ancestors of the Janjuas Rajputs , the last dynasty of the Janjua Shahis, were mentioned by Albiruni..""""as noble men of noble bearings...who always did what they said"""". Al-Biruni, despite living under Sultan Mahmud's grace, praises the house of Jayapala Janjua (10th Century AD): """"We must say that in all their grandeur, they never slackened in the ardent desire of doing that which is good and right, that they were men of noble sentiment and noble bearing."""" Kalhana (13th Century AD) writes of the Janjua Shahis: """"Where is the Shahi dynasty with its ministers, its kings, and its great grandeur? ... The very name of the splendor of Shahi kings has vanished. What is not seen in dream, what even our imagination cannot conceive, that dynasty accomplished with ease"""".

The Tarikh-e-Alfi of the Ghorids (13th Century AD) mentions the rebellious behaviour of [1]Raja (Ajmal) Mal (est. d. 1230 AD) (son of Raja Dhrupat Dev of Mathura) towards the Delhi Sultanate. It records that a """"Rai Mal"""" of the mountains between Lahore and Kabul excited a rebellion against them and intercepted communications between Lahore and Ghazni. There is still today remnants of an ancient fort in Malot, Chakwal which was initially built by the Shahis and later rebuilt by Raja Mal Janjua. It is also inscribed that the last Hindu Shahi emperor Raja Mal embraced Islam at this place. Raja Mal was also the first ruler to begin the mining of salt in the Salt Ranges of Kallar Kahar and in the Khewra Salt Mines of Punjab which is currently the world's second largest salt mine. Many prominent Muslim tribes of Potohar Plateau in Pakistan trace their lineage back to the Janjuas through the five princes of the House of Raja Mal Janjua (13th Century AD). The five princes were: Raja Bhir Raja Jodh (est. d. 1259 AD) (ancestor of Chakri/Bajwala / Darapur Janjuas) Raja Kala Raja Tanoli Raja Khakha Jodh and Bhir were born of a Gakhar Rani while Kala, Khakha and Tanoli were born of another Rajput Rani. ('Journal of Central Asia', Vol.XIII, no.1, 1990 p79). According to Lepel H. Griffin, in his famous book Chiefs and Families of note in the Punjab (Lahore, 1910, ii, p254) he writes that Raja Jodh and Raja Wir/Bhir (oldest sons of Rai Mal), """"divided the country, the Maloki Dhan, between them. Jodh took the Salt Range near about the Makrach and captured the town of Makshala from a colony of Brahmans...He changed its name to Makhiala and built there a fort and two tanks for rain water. Wir (also spelt Bhir), the eldest son of Raja Mal, took the possession of Kura (also spelt Khewra) near modern Pind Dadan Khan...""""

 Re:Critics 

Yes, you have a very good point. I'm am truely sorry for what I have done but I just hate it when people act so stupid and don't know anything on the subject, and yet, they contribute to it anyway by putting their false information on it. 

I sort of disagree with you about my Montenegrin. I truely do understand it and know how to write it, but I am writing in non-stop English that I am forgetting some words and how to phrase out the words. 

Yes, I do have pride in my Montenegrindom, but my actions have led me to downgrade that pride on wikipedia. From now on, I am neutral on many matters. If I know about a topic and write about it, I want people to agree me, not to go against me. 

Also, I am terribly sorry for critisizing you for being a """"Serb nationalist and using too many pro-Serb sources"""" when I know you try to stay neutral. I just had this bad hunch that you may be at it """"again"""" while reviewing the talk page on the Duklja article. 

You and anyone else may critisize me all you want and I will stop critizising you and any other person. And yes, I can get pissed off very easily at times, but I let it go until I really get ticked when the person who is pissing me off does it constantly.

Well, I see that you're making great hunches on these sockpuppets, though I wouldn't want to go too far with this. Well, anyways, I just wanted to clear things. Thanks again. Bye.  """,0
"Introduction & the article 

Hi new poster here, ive been following the article for a few weeks, I have reviewed the external links good and bad and have a few ideas.  The controversy that surrounds this organization seems to be based between nichiren shoshu(in japan) and sgi(international) with alot of the groundwork coming from japan where the organizations originated from.  After looking around and comparing to the other religions and sects, i propose we seperate the criticisms from each article and make a new article that, most likely, will be a cite war.  
  The benefit is two-fold.  First, the articles relating to each sect of buddhism talk about THAT buddhism, what they do, where they came from, etc etc, and not talk about the criticisms that anyone may have about them(similar to the anti-christianity criticism article and others).  This is the most NPOV solution i can up with.  Also, having a criticisms oriented paragraph in the intoduction seems extremely bias against an organization that promotes culture and peace(i have seen some demonstrations, nothing on a global scale or read about the political party, has anyone btw?)  Secondly, in the split article section, the details can come out a little more clearly as they arent presented on the article talking about a buddhist sect, its an article about how the sect is impacting the world.  It just seems a bit more accurate.  
  Hopefully i will have a viable solution setup after i do some more reading about editing etc... Thoughts?",0

""""The last of these three, No. 13, KV. 415, is an ambitious, perhaps even overambitious work, that introduces the first, military theme in a canon in an impressive orchestral opening: the last movement is considered to be the best.""""""""

"""

 Proposing renaming and new article draft 

Over the last couple of months I have produced a new draft of this article, working on behalf of New Leaders. The organization asked me to write an updated draft, better reflecting their new name and current programs and bringing the article into line with Wikipedia's guidelines. The most immediate issue with the current article is that the title is now incorrect. The organization has recently been renamed to """"New Leaders"""" and is now no longer """"New Leaders for New Schools"""". Due to this change, I believe that the article should be renamed.

I recognize that since I prepared my draft on behalf of New Leaders, I have a conflict of interest. So, before I make any changes, I'd like to ask that other editors read through my draft and my explanation here, and offer any feedback they might have. 

There are a number of problems with the current article, not least that it is rather promotional in tone. It seems that this has attracted the attention of editors in the past, as you can see from the warning tag. However, despite the warning tag, and the discussion that was opened by NDSteve10 on the Talk page (see above), there hasn't really been any improvement to the article in the last 12 months. No editors responded to the Talk page note, and only a few edits have been made. In fact, little has changed with the article since it was originally created in December 2009. 

The article currently has few citations, less than half of which are reliable secondary sources. The introduction doesn't adequately summarize the article, and certainly does not give a real sense of what New Leaders does. The most problematic sections are What it does and Educational impact, both of which are written in a promotional tone, especially the latter. In addition, the """"What it does"""" section is outdated, since the organization has since introduced new programs and initiatives. Meanwhile, the """"Educational impact"""" section provides a lot of detail, but would be better presented using Wikipedia's summary style. The information provided is cited to New Leaders' website, but makes no mention that the source of the claims is the organization itself.

I would like to propose a new draft of the article that addresses the issues with the current version, which you can view in my userspace:User:16912 Rhiannon/New Leaders

This is an entirely re-written article, using reliable secondary sources as much as possible, with new section headings to provide readers with a sense of the content at a glance, a new introduction which properly summarizes the article, and an infobox with all the key information about the organization fully up to date. The """"Creation and history"""" section now includes details of the organization's founding and expansion up to the present day. The descriptive information about New Leaders' has been removed, as this is more relevant in the new """"Function"""" section. The information from the current """"What it does"""" and """"Educational impact"""" sections has been rewritten under a new section heading of """"Function"""", which includes the organization's mission, its programs and its results. This section provides details of all the organization's current initiatives and an overview of the impact of these programs. I have retained the sections on """"Geographic reach"""" and """"Executive team"""", but updated the information in each and added citations. 

While I have put much effort into writing this from a neutral POV, I appreciate that due to my COI it may be that other editors have some changes to suggest. I welcome any productive feedback on the draft and my suggestion to rename the article to New Leaders. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or questions. Thanks,   """,0

"""

In the past there was no such nation as """"Germany"""". It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as """"Brandenburg"""", """"Saxony"""", """"Hanover"""" etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like """"Hanoverian"""" and """"Bavarian"""" no longer refer to national identities because they're all just """"German"""" or """"Deutsch"""". However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture """"Bavarian"""" ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name """"Macedonia"""", except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context....... Kurt Stein""",0
"""Here's another nice quote from Li from the Essentials:

Most fundamentally, you all still need to establish your great mighty virtue in the process of shattering the old forces’ persecution, and return to your highest positions. So this isn’t a matter of reaching Consummation in ordinary realms, nor is it achievable in ordinary Consummation. It might seem that you have done what you should do for Dafa, when actually, you are doing it for your comprehensive Consummation and return. If during this period you cannot do well with what you should do, this Consummation stage can only be a cultivation process, and it cannot fundamentally be a Fa-rectification disciple’s true and final Consummation. If during the evil’s persecution a Dafa disciple doesn’t do well or slacks off, it’s very possible all his previous efforts will have been for nothing.

In other words, if you can't live up to the challenge of """"shattering the old forces's persecution"""" you can't consider yourself a Fa-rectiication disciple.  And what distinguishes a """"Fa-rectificatrion disiciple""""  from an common ordinary disciple?  Well, it's what you do to protect the Master's Fa against the evil forces, isn't it?   Elsewhere the Master actually says this is you duty as a practitioner.

 More description of location please? 

Hello, I wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence, maybe in the description section, to explain where this bridge is? I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like """"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage"""" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg.

 About .  

I already e-mailed this report on . I hope that someone of serious Wikipedia administrators will read this report and take serious steps in protecting the Wikipedia dignity

Hello,

I do understand that Wikipedia is a free encyclopaedia - but still some kind of very basic ethicalrules shall be applicable and obliging to all editors.I noticed that you have a person whose nick name is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab and whose number of edits goes over 60 per day very often spanning 5-11 hours dayly. This person is extremely agressive and intolerant and his/her edits are causing a lot of damage and irritated many people.

The best way to describe his/her behaviour and 'contributions' are given by a few people which can be summarised/quoted this way:

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Spylab&oldid;=65026476

'I am probably from the USA and like to scrap others' contributions due to what I call """"factual correctness"""" - instead of knowing the facts and reporting them!'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab/User_talk:Spylab/archive3#What.27s_is_the_problem.3F.3F.3F

'I've noticed that you are editing someone's contribution by altering the text under pretext of grammar corrections - not reading references at all. Moreover, not reading the references nor providing your own - you are demanding new references.

Also, on January 12th you've made 65 edits on various articles in the span of more than 11 hours(merge, clean, copy, revert, etc). Don't you think that it might be seen as something wrong with you if you are spending day after day, hours and hours - practically not contributing anything serious to Wikipedia, only irritating many people this way???'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#About_Basic_Editorial_Ethics_Here

'When seeing that the existing edition of the Croatia section here, was reduced by User:Spylab to just 6 sentences out of which four were marked by the [citation needed] tag . Moreover, User:Spylab 'completed' his own 'editorial' work by adding {unreferenced|date=November 2006} and {weasel} tags on the top of this page!!! How a serious editor could tag/mark his own edits this way??? I reverted the section demanding explanation for this almost complete section destruction. Ultimately, the existing edits cannot be re-written or destroyed by just throwing claim 'replaced content with info from Neo-Nazism in Croatia because old version didn't focus on neo-Nazism' as he did.

All my attempts to bring the editorial work on the same start and support any further editorial work with facts and serious observations - failed. Instead even willing to discuss the issue seriously, User:Spylab started throwing accusations 'last edit brok 3RR rule', 'you may be blocked' , 'sock-puppetry' etc. and selfpraising (User:Spylab) work as superior and claiming that I do not know what Neo-Nazism is. My attempt (questions) to ask him why he deleted what he deleted already - are removed from the talk page and when I've put back the deleted questions - User:Spylab ignored them completely.

I had impression that I have to deal with an extremely cheeky and primitive personality and wondered how this person could have any access to the editirial work here. Then, I went further and examined the whole User:Spylab editorial work and noticed that User:Spylab commited more than 500 changes within 10 days i.e. more than fifty edits per day - (November 28 - December 7 2006). In that period of time [User:Spylab] was busy by the Wikipedia editing on: November 29 - 9 hours, November 30 - 16 hours (63 edits!!!) , December 1 - 18 hours, December 2 - 7 hours, December 3 - 8 hours, December 4 - 21 hours, December 5 - 12 hours, December 6 - 17 hours, and December 7 - 8 hours.

The content of User:Spylab edits were - spelling check, version reverts, removal of links, copy-paste etc. So it is quite clearly that I had to deal with a mentally challenged person!!!

I just wonder how it is possible that a serious publisher could allow such access to the articles to a person like User:Spylab.' As per his/her own words, as an Neo-Nazism in Croatia section editor, Spylab publicly claims

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Page_protection_sought

'Actually, it's not complicated at all. The revert war has nothing to do with point of view, and I am not an expert on Croatia at all.'

My note - how then this person should edit some subject (s)he is not familirar with? Also, all references written in Croatian and given here in the Neo-Nazism in Croatia were removed. As per Spylab question here

Good luck at trying to turn this article into a """"good NPOV article"""" when the cover to the book states that it was written by Michael D. Langone and his colleagues. From what I can see, most of the """"notable"""" authors belong to, were associated with or  associate themselves with the American Family Association. As a matter of fact, Michael D. Langone, PhD is the executive director for the American Family Association, which promotes controversial, conservative, fundamentalist Christian values . This indicates to me that this book and its authors are inherently biased. The book appears to have been published to further the agenda of the American Family Association, as it advertises it on the back cover of the book itself. For example, Margaret Singer was on the board of the AFA.  talk-email """,0

Furthermore, my comments were on a discussion page, not an actual wikipedia article, and while colorful adjectives are generally frowned upon for encyclical work, discussion pages, in my opinion, should be more colloquial.

"Free Software example 

I'm not sure if the reference to open source as an example of innovation outside the 'traditional' IP model is as strong as it could be. As far as I can see, the 'standard' argument for IP protection is not that it's the only way that people can innovate, but that the overall level of innovation will be much higher with it. 

The fact that 'works of authorship can be written without direct financial incentives' does not in itself contradict the standard IP model. For such criticism to be very strong, you would have to show not only that 'direct financial incentives' are not always required, but also that 'direct financial incentives' do not act as a meaningful incentive to innovate in significant cases.

In other words, the standard IP model does not say that counterexamples cannot exist. It just says that you will get more overall innovation with IP protection that you would without it. Listing counterexamples, without also discussing their wider significance, does not in itself invalidate the 'incentives to innovate' argument. It would perhaps be better to cite studies of the effects of patent reform or something like that.",0

I'm highly amazed by the fact that this debate rages on. If I may interject, Aleta formed a subsection entitled Arbitrary Page Break. Note using the word Arbitrary over say, Random? Are we going to throw a huge fuss over the inclusion of a more sophisticated word? Sobriquet is quite clearly at least somewhat different from Nickname, otherwise there would be only one article encompassing both words. My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade-level vocabulary into it as a means of providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to """"dumb down"""" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there's Simple English to cater to that need. So, that's my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don't know what a word means, just look it up.

  Central figures behind FishBase are Daniel Pauly and the fish biologists around him at the UBC Fisheries Centre. FishBase itself is supervised by an international consortium which fields many of the world's most prominent fish scientists. The consortium includes the FAO itself, so in that sense it would be true to say that FishBase and the FAO are entangled. The central fisheries scientist at the FAO for many years was John Caddy. Daniel Pauly and John Caddy have, over the years had conflicts which could be regarded as representative of conflicts between FishBase and the FAO. Two high profile examples that spring to mind were a disagreement in 1999 over fishing down the food web, and a conflict in 2001 over FAO fishery returns. I have never seen FishBase and the FAO disagree on the common names of fish. That issue would arises only in relation to commercially significant fishes, since the FAO does not concern itself with fish that are not commercially significant. Presumably many wide ranging accommodations and rationalisations have been made within the FishBase consortium, and suppose this would be an example of one of them. We cannot know for sure, since the consortium doesn't seem to make its deliberations public. But the attempts some editors are making on this page to discredit FishBase are, well just plain ridiculous.   23:33",0

Maybe wikipedia should wake up to themselves, unblock Eddieebo's account, he has made some useful contributions, sure he swears a lot while talking, but thats because people like you shit him up the wall to no end. Left-wing hippies who are all about the people except when that person is right of Ghengis Khan, like Eddieebo.

 Archiving deleted gay material 

It has been suggested the two are gay or suffering from gender confusion. Rod stated in 'Tis the Fifteenth Season he was jealous of girls because they get to wear dresses. In Bart to the Future, an episode depicting the future, Ned thanks Bart for not outing Rod and Todd who are shown bare-chested washing a cabinet in a slightly feminine way whilst wearing tight denim cut-off shorts and sporting mustaches, known as the Castro clone style fashionable in gay culture in the 1980s and popularized by Freddie Mercury.
Rod and Todd are both extremely sheltered from girls as their father consider girls to be a temptation along with rock and roll music. In another future-set episode, """"Future-Drama"""" Bart's girlfriend mentions she wants to make love to him on prom night, and becomes disappointed when he denies her. She says, """"I never had this problem with Todd Flanders!"""", implying a strong, though latent, sexuality in the boy.

 Re: Coca-Cola 

Sorry if I rudely didn't drop an explanatory note at your talk page; it was rude of me and poor behavior.

Please see our Manual of Style to understand the correct formatting and appearance standards. The one issue with your additions is that the captions for the images are entirely too long and full of extraneous information; image captions are not museum display cards and do not serve to detail every single item appearing in the image; Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a museum. They should also never state """"note the x"""" or other similar attention drawing text, per WP:W2W, one of our guidelines on writing prose. They also had inappropriate use of capitalization, boldface and other formatting issues. For example, ALLCAPS spelling is never used for emphasis, as it is read as shouting on the Internet. 

As for the Coca-Cola additions, I took them out for lack of relevance. The Coca-Cola article is about the drink, not the company; that's at The Coca-Cola Company. The information in those images is better placed there, but in the article text, not the image caption.

The other reversions were based on similar concerns; the same sort of formatting and caption length issues were present there. In the one article, for example, the caption was nearly as long as the rest of the text in the article, when that text should really go in the article's body text instead. 

Once again, my apologies for biting your head off, as you were editting in good faith. I hope that my poor behavior doesn't turn you off to the collabrative process and that, with a bit of polishing, you can add much to our growing base of knowledge.

I do not know how far you up to date with the conflict that is keeping editors from editing the page. If not, I suggest you have a look at the arbitration case that is currently pending.  

To facilitate, this was the version most people (except Marcosantezana) could live with:

Natural selection is the process in which individual organisms that possess favourable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.  Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.

The term was introduced by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book """"The Origin of Species"""", as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock, which Darwin called artificial selection.

Maybe you find it not god, and in that case, I am curious what you think of that.

""""Scientists occasionally invent hypothetical entities with special abilities as part of a thought experiment. These """"demons"""" have abilities that are nearly limitless, but they are still subject to the physical laws being theorized about.

For example, in Descartes' Second Meditation, it is argued, as a thought experiment, that it is at least possible that there is an all-powerful evil demon who is deceiving me, such that this demon causes me to have false beliefs, including the belief that there is an object before me and the belief that two plus three equals five. Note that the power of such a demon would be two-fold: both empirical and rational thinking can be completely compromised. This leads to a worrisome argument:

   1. One knows some fact or other only when one can rule out that there is such a demon.
   2. But one can never be in a position rule out that there is such a being, since we can never be sure that the demon isn't merely toying with our epistemic situation.
   3. Thus, we can never know any facts at all!

Not being used to Wiki process I didn't see the warning until after it was made although I'm not sure what that difference would have made long term. The notion of fascism in respect of the operation of wiki is not meant as an insult but describes a particular way of operating a nation, organisation etc. Having spent many years dealing with institutional abuse of authority etc. the """"harassment"""" of my contribution was corporate, but for those very reasons it will not be a productive line of enquiry. I suppose I could also turn to a zealous enforcement of the rules and seek wiki awards. 
Anyway in respect of my request we're now leaving wiki territory in terms of copyright and going where statutory law applies. Can you point me in the direction of an administrator or agent of wiki that can deal with this issue knowledgeabley? I haven't assigned copyright to wiki and wiki policy can't supersede law. I suppose I could formally assign copyright of all those images to a third party which would immediately create a wiki violation.
I'd also be interested in views about the difference between self-interest in requiring attribution and that notion in respect of links. It's a mark (and again this is a valid view) of paternalistic and authoritarian operations no matter how benign to operate arbitrarily without explanation. I'm asking this because there is a prima facia contradiction in application of the stated rules, although I'm not expecting this to receive an effective explanation this time any more than last.

Receiving money from KGB (edit request)
Rajiv Gandhi and his family including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi received money from KGB. The payments were authorised by a resolution and endorsed by the USSR Council of Ministers, and had been coming since 1971. In December 2001, Subramanian Swamy filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court, acting on which the court ordered CBI to ascertain the truth of the allegations in May 2002. After two years, the CBI told the Court that Russia would not entertain such queries without a registered FIR.

Since the Rajiv Gandhi (former PM of India) page mentions the above, this should be mentioned on Rahul's page too. This guy is being projected as the next Prime Minister of India. A fact like this cannot be suppressed, considering that the Russians confirm that KGB paid Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. 70.76.85.36  """,0

= My Famous Article ==witze  happiness − wikipedia The Witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families, regardless of race, age, character or knowledge. The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.

The Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.

                           History
The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.

                       Proper History
As early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.",0

"It appears that your New Zealander was best known as Don Cameron, so maybe it would be better to rename him. But with an article that states Donald Cameron (Scottish rugby union), could it not be confused that he is an administrator of the SRU and not a Scottish rugby union centre. It's a continual problem in sport, and many articles then differentiate through position or date of birth. There are some international Welsh Rugby players who share their names with three or four other team mates. There are two David Jones both forwards who played for Wales, and were both born in 1881, that's a right pain.",0

The trouble is that that version was hype too. Wikipedia is not a press coverage scrapbook (WP:LINKFARM) - I realise it was put in to peacock Ethereum for the AFD (which is why it looked so artificial), but the point stands that if those articles are worth including, they need to actually be used as references.
I note also the heading is """"reception"""" - none of it is talking about how Ethereum has been received, it's just a list of press clippings. From e.g. the version before I touched it, there's two statements from non-SP-notable people and one from someone notable enough to have a WP article who also happens to do amateur economics blogging.
So if a """"Reception"""" section is to be of value, it needs to actually be about the reception -   """,0

As for the allegations of Roed-Larsen, why do imagine that they were based on the IDF spokesman's claim, as opposed to the many claims of massacre from Palestinians weeks earlier.  On April 4, Secretary-General of the Palestinian Authority, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, complained in an interview on Palestinian television about “…world silence over the massacres being perpetrated against the Palestinian people.” (BBC Worldwide Monitoring). On April 6, Nabil Sha'ath delivered a speech at a meeting of the Arab League, in which he charged that “a 'massacre' was underway in the Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin.” (Deutsche Presse-Agentur) He also “compared Israeli actions in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus to the 1982 massacres of hundreds of Palestinans…” (The Associated Press). On April 7, Abdel Rahman told NBC’s Tim Russert, “The victims so far has been over 250 Palestinians killed, many of them are children and women.” Saeb Erekat is quoted by Washington Post as having said “This is not fighting between armies, but a massacre in Jenin camp.""""  Why do you think that the IDF spokesman's statements from over a week later were so influential, as opposed to these many public statements by Palestinian spokesmen which were widely disseminated in major news outlets?

"Nephilim deleted edit 

You state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).
This aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. 
The next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. 
Here is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.
The next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.
This again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?
You may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.
Once before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.
The reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it.

Here's my five cents: I do not think it is practical to give coords for a middle point of Routes. I have looked around a bit and the only place I happened to find such coords is in Bundesautobahn 2. In this example there is an important junction in a city near the centre, so it makes sense, but in some Routes like Route 10 which consist of 3 or more separate fragments, defining any """"central"""" point on them is too arbitrary. Also some routes are important and wide for a part of their length only, so their """"middle"""" is not anything to go by. I would be happy with 2 points, but I know this is not practical in searching. I think an important destination (city or big town) somewhere between 1/3 and 2/3 of their length should be picked.

Come on guys. The section on Turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of Pelosi's attitude to the proposed bill on the so-called Armenian Genocide and doesn't give the other side to provide any justification why the Prime minister of Tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. I think that for the neuturality of this article, the section on Turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue.

Otherwise, this section seems like an election platform of ms. nancy prior to elections.

I have been trying to extend this section, but pro-Nancy editors and probably her office staff are deleting all my additions without any justification.

Biased section on Turkey

""""Turkey On October 11, 2007, regarding a proposed House resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi said that the measure would be brought to a vote because """"While that may have been a long time ago, genocide is taking place now in Darfur, it did within recent memory in Rwanda, so as long as there is genocide there is need to speak out against it..."""" [27] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. [28]"""""""" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

Stop with the damn accusations of pro-nancy and elections. If you knew anything about American politics you would know how silly that sounds. You have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. You also have the ability to edit the page yourself, but I doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide. Turtlescrubber  

""""give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime). Andranikpasha  
Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation.

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information.

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section. Raman, Massachusetts —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

The section is grossly biased in favor of Pelosi-s pro-armenian stance and justification. She wants to sell something which didn't happen due to funds she receive from the Armenian lobby. 
She wants to compare the armenian killings with those of Jews genocide and Rwanda genocide. She forgets following differences between these events. 

Nationalist Armenians were at war with the Turks in 1915 (both in Anatolia and Caucausus), and the Armenian generals and guerilla leaders who commanded them are still honored as Armenian heroes today. Military leaders like Generals Andranik Oznanian, Garegin Nzhdeh, Drastamat Kanahyan (“General Dro”), and Garo Pasdirmaijan (“Armen Garo”) are largely unknown to Americans whose knowledge of Armenian history is limited to the orthodox genocide literature, but well-known by Armenians. Here, again, the analogy to the Jews of the Holocaust simply does not fit. There are no statues to the Jewish generals who fought the Nazis in Germany in 1942-43, because there were none.

 gloves 

Speaking from expirience, wearing both gloves is definantly a good idea.  On the note of safety procedure, my friend managed to get a 'sun burn' from the high intensity light.

Electrode """"Cleaning"""",

is commonly performed by grinding (shaping) the tungsten electrode into a fine, burr-less 'pencil point', using a high speed diamond abrasive wheel. The shape, and angle acuteness of the point, also plays a role in the 'focused' shape of the plasma arc.  The DC arc largely applicable to ferrous metals, benefits from using 2% thoriated tungsten (or 2% ceriated tungsten, an alternative to the radiological concerns of Thorium), while nonferrous metals such as aluminum and magnesium requiring AC current, are performed best with pure tungsten allowing the tip to melt into an enlarged balled surface at the end of the electrode.  A """"ball-point"""" subsequently flares the arc onto a much broader surface of the material, where greater expansion and distortion must then be accommodated, or anticipated as part of the welders job.

More Cleaning

There's cleaning or shaping of the electrode, and then there's cleaning or """"preparation"""" of the work-piece to be welded:  

As you say, dirt, oil and scale are simply removed from parts for a good weld.  Washing, degreasing, rinsing etc, but mechanical abrasion is fast, easy and most popular as shaping a weld chamfer can be done simultaneous to """"cleaning"""".   AlumaPrep (or some brand name like that), is simply an acid rinse to remove stubborn anodizing and any last marks of finger print oil from the 'touchy' AC needing metals.  But as Triddle pointed out in his explanation of +/- wave form capable machines, the plasma itself will often do a fine job of burning off simple surface impurities.  Deep inclusions (ubiquitous in sand casted work) are a frustration all unto themselves.  Welder (the person) tolerance, patience, and experience must often judge what level of weld quality exist after cooling.  High-tech work, demands that the work piece billet is good stuff to begin with, yet there is a variety of filler rod that can be used to accommodate persnickety base material.  Nickle, Bronze and """"Everdure"""" (brand name) are often blended into filler rods, and greatly assist the welder trying to fix cracked engine blocks or other sandy and oil impregnated work pieces.

Reactor vessels of all types, be they nuclear or cellular, are also a field unto themselves.  As the physical strength of a finished weld may really be the lesser of engineering concerns.  Chemistry plays a role in both questions of what will actually be held in the vessel, and how it may be cleaned between use.  Low carbon 316 SS (316L) commonly desired for biomedical applications where autoclaving and bleach will still kick the ass out of Stainless Steel.  Titanium and its many grades are like wise a subject for deep thought, but once the decision is made...  it works like soft butter, and few other welds can look so nice raw.

As to the safety stuff.

A hot horse shoe is hot, and most animals with any brain will let go of it before they get burned too bad.  Therefor, direct and immediate sensible surface heat, is far less of real danger than the intense UV of the plasma arch as Gaiusjuliuscesar talked about 'sun burn', often called """"flash burn"""".  Fully covering any skin, just as one might wish to reduce sun burn.  It's the same stuff.  Welders, responsible ones, will even clear a room of bystanders, even ones who """"know not to look into the light with out a hood"""".  Side vision (looking off to one side) doesn't work either, as the cornea and retina damage (not dependent on center of focused vision) is extremely painful when experienced, (ya, I know) and not felt for many hours after excessive exposure.

To Huon and Stephan2 ' At the present time I do not agree with either of your positions regarding the use of images on the Sergio Franchi biography. First of all are enough images."""" I do not believe that editors should be concerned with the absolute number of images. I do not believe that pictures which represent different aspects of a person's life are excessive. On the Filmography I used lots of images because Franchi was in a lot of TV productions. On the biography page, I am sure I could remove a few images, but our culture is image-driven and I used the images believing that their use would draw attention to this person's life. Dying before the advent of the internet his memory was almost allowed to die because none of his contemporaries carried his story onto the internet..thus my desire to preserve the biography of a person who was very important during the late 20th century in musical and theater history. As for my own motives as an editor of Wikipedia, I have used my work on these pages to increase my expertise as a Wikipedia editor, and have made contributions on every page that I felt competent to add at the time. This has also increased my editorial knowledge.  Enough about personal motivation. As to the issue at hand... Wikipedia's biography portal describes a biography as """"a detailed description of someone's life. More than a list of basic facts [education, relationships, and death)....a biography ...highlights various aspects of his or her life...."""" THAT is why I believe that the non-free image depicting Franchi's beloved avocations were deserving of representation in the 2 photos showing his automobile and pewter collections. I also felt that a textual statement would be enhanced by the 2 photos that I had discovered. As to the Non-free book cover depicting Sergio Franchi's 18 months of his life on the Broadway stage musical """"Nine'..as you are aware, usually only the original creator of the role is given fair space. However, his role was considered import enough by the producers to warrant new posters, programs, and an original song...I believe that the visual reminder of his impact on musical theater in 1984 was important. There were no other free images available after 1976 when the copyright law regarding publicity photos. I am interested in improving as an editor, and if you still believe that I should remove the Library of Congress image (Pewter collection), I will comply with your suggestion. Please consider my argument on it's retention. Thanks

Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, has admitted that the much loved """"free encyclopedia"""" has at least some quality problems. To some of us, this is nothing new. I've had more than one student rely on Wikipedia for accurate information for a paper, and it always ends up the same way: """"well, I got it off of Wikipedia, thinking it was good..."""".

And therein lies the problem. If you keep in mind that anyone, and I mean anyone, can edit a Wikipedia entry, then you are treading on dangerous ground if you're going to cite it as a source of fact. While it's true that errors often get corrected, they don't always, and what happens in the meantime is that bad info sits there, misinforming people. Of course, this isn't true just in the case of Wikipedia. It's a problem online, in general. I recently was party to an argument over the historicity of Jesus, and one person used a source that claimed that Philo of Alexandria lived in Jerusalem. He's called Philo of Alexandria for a reason, you know.[] 

I used to be such an unadulterated fan of Wikipedia you know. The idea of an open source online reference that grew on a daily basis was quite an attractive one back in the day. But in recent times I've become wary of the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, and not simply because of a few high profile choice edits.

Whatever about libel and congressional cherry picking amidst the many articles of this once noble enterprise, what really gets me about Wikipedia is that I can't trust it on most issues. There are so many agendas, axes to grind and purely mischievous vandals that 90% of what I would be interested in reading about - history, politics and so on - is tripe. To read an article on a contentious subject one can pick out bias, attempted compromise and ultimate failure almost immediately. Wade into the """"Talk"""" page, where these edits are discussed, and you are confronted with chaos. There are too many vested interests at stake, and from the War on Terror to the Welfare State one will find an army of people taking one view or another entering into what are known as """"Revert Wars"""", where they revert any edits back to the version which suits them.

From self-interest to political interest one can find """"POV"""" (Point of View) shading almost every major article that touches on the live wires of our society. Thus I wouldn't trust anything that's even half-way current or ongoing on Wikipedia.

For one, the facts can be skewed. Secondly, the article can change overnight depending on how organised a campaign is launched against an article (and they do happen.)

 Point by point 

(1) The current text has:
Take, for example, the rainbow of colours reflected from a puddle of water when a thin film of oil rests on its surface. That phenomenon can be understood by thinking of light as waves, the length of which results in different colours.A very clear explanation of interference in thin films may be found in Sears, op. cit., p. 203ff. Other phenomena, like the working of light meters in cameras, can be explained by thinking in terms of particles of light (called photons) colliding with the detection screen inside the meter, the force of which is registered mechanically by a pointer or needle.

This is just plain wrong.  The length of waves does not """"result in different colours."""" The different wavelengths of light are perceived as different colors.  And the fact that the waves of light have different lengths does not explain the """"rainbow of colours"""" either. If the editor had bothered to read Sears he would have an understanding that would allow a correct explanation, not an exercise in the mystification of the novice reader.  

Second, the description of the light meter suggests a device like the carnival strength meter in which a contestant strikes a lever using a sledge hammer and the other end of the lever hits a ball that then moves vertically alongside a measuring stick of some kind. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Even if the crude analogy of an electron as a bullet that strikes electrons and knocks them out of their original planetary orbits be accepted, the electrons do not then physically strike the end of a needle that then moves along a dial face. T

If this article is to be radically rewritten, it should be done so with both a clear understanding of what the true facts are and also with an eye to presenting those facts in a way that will not cause very damaging preconceptions to form in the mind of the novice reader.

It is the differences in phases between the light waves reflected by the air/oil surface vs. the phases in the light waves reflected by the oil/water interface that effectively """"cancels"""" light of some wavelengths and permits light of some wavelengths to reach the eye of the observer from each different region of thickness of the oil film.  You criticized the original diagram that clearly shows how interference occurs as """"off-putting."""" But what have you put in its place?

It is the (mechanical analogy) pressure of the dislodged electrons that moves them off of the surface of the metal plate and through a wire to an electromagnet that attracts the spring-balanced needle which then moves in a way proportional to the induced amperage. Then they go through another wire back to the """"low pressure"""" region of the metal plate. Even in modern light meters, it is all a matter of electrons moving in electrical circuits, not electrons pushing on lever arms.

Please be careful to give the most useful citations. I have discovered one citation that is a circular reference to a Wikipedia article by way of an external """"encyclopedia."""" Also, the expression """"Trojan wave packet"""" will not mean anything to the average well informed reader, hence serving only to create an air of mystery and incomprehensibility.  I have already supplied a reference that distinguishes Trojan wave packets from other wave packets.  """,0

"""Changes to this Page - Open discussion ==
Since my first contribution over two months ago, I have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. After an initial consultation with an administrator I decided to """"be bold"""" and start a """"démenagement"""" of all that had nothing to do with the city of Paris. I was met with opposition over a link - and after being complained about I thought it best to put things back the way they were until I could get a good feel of the """"general concensus"""" of the page's contibutors. I have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.

My goal here is not to """"control"""" anything, as was complained to one of the administrators - I would like only to contribute to making a better page. I have learned much from other Paris pages and pages concerning French history - namely those concerning the French kings - but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement, so I had little to do there. This page, on the other hand, I find lacking, and see many things that could be improved.

The most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information - far too much for a general """"Paris"""" page. The search function is a very important element of Wikipedia, and with this in mind, much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. Those looking for """"Paris economy"""" will type exactly that into the search window. The same for """"Paris history"""" or """"paris fashion"""". Here I am but repeating what I have already written below.

In short, in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of Paris, or one totally ignorant on the subject  - in other words, one who knows only enough to type only """"Paris"""" into the search window - I propose to move the more """"specialty"""" information to their own pages. My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a """"specialty"""" page of its own. This would even be a positive move, as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.

The irony of the sort is that, though I contribute to Wiki, it won't be to this page in any quantity. My specialty is the history of Paris, and I cannot even think to add that knowledge here - Paris' history has a page of its own. Just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.

Here I would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. I hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement - please answer with any ideas you would have. With this post I would also like to """"sound the board"""" - to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page, as what I have seen to date leaves room for doubt. In your answers, I hope for evidence to the contrary. 

Please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all.

Aleppo central prison liberated
http://sana.sy/eng/21/2014/05/22/546092.htm

Damascus, (SANA) Army units successfully wrapped up military operations in the vicinity of Aleppo Central Prison after they had broken the siege on the troops defending it, the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces said.

In a statement issued Thursday, the Command announced that army units have regained control over a site where a law-enforcement battalion is stationed north of the prison and tightened grip on the adjacent areas, inflicting back-breaking losses on the armed groups.

""""The new achievement is highly important as it serves to tighten the noose on residual terrorist groups in the eastern and northeastern outskirts of Aleppo city and cuts off supply lines that terrorist gangs were using for movement from the [Aleppo] northern countryside towards the city,'' added the statement.

The statement lauded the feat as a """"body blow"""" for terrorist gangs which used Aleppo northern countryside as a springboard to launch attacks against Aleppo city, adding that it """"gives the lie to claims and fabrications"""" about terrorist groups seizing control of the prison.

The Command concluded by vowing non-stop efforts to strike terrorists hard and bring back security and stability to Aleppo """"and every inch of the Syrian land.""""

Yes I am not sure best how to proceed here. One of the problems with consistency is that generally the most commonly reported numbers are the general opinion as I understand the matter. Two of the ways we could proceed are either 

I. Add a column noting that these are the """"most likely voting numbers"""" or however you want to label it and the other as """"general opinion"""". This can result in updating the current chart where you may have to list one or more numbers for each poll which is kind of problematic.
    
The second approach here is to create a second list, similar to the Best PM list and report it as the most likely to vote.

"up, Martinez decided to law low from the city for a while, but eventually came back to mess with Vic’s woman, Louise. Since the failed deal, the Vance brothers were forced to do business with the Mendez brothers. This was around the time the Vances built their own organization in power, taking over businesses from rival gangs. Victor did help with a transgender get things straight and met Phil Collins and his manager. At first, it was believed that the Mendez Cartel wanted to establish a business relationship, but their real plan was to have the Vances give their businesses to the Mendez’s and leave Vice City, or the Vance brothers and Louise would die. When they refused, the Cartel kidnapped them and took them near the Escobar International Airport. The brothers blew the death row and stopped Mendez’s men from taking over their businesses. Their plans were foiled. They kidnapped Louise and threatened to kill her if the brothers didn’t leave the city. Not long before the Vances storm into their mansion in Prawn Island. Lance was held hostage, while Victor proceeded through the gangsters and killed Armando Mendez. Louise was left on the floor dying, next to Lance. A vengeful Victor formed an alliance with Ricardo Diaz (a crime lord) to bring down the Mendez’s operations once and for all. Victor invaded into the military base, stole their army helicopter, and returned it to Diaz’s mansion in Starfish Island. Once back in the chopper, Victor said he would owe Ricardo nothing and was doing this for him. After that, he flew to the Mendez penthouse and killed all the Mendez henchmen at the building in downtown. Jerry Martinez arrived in the scene and was prepared to kill Victor. Finally at the rooftop, in the final confrontation, Jerry Martinez cornered Vic, believing he was too easy to trick. Diego Mendez came and the final shootout between the 3 men led to the deaths of Diego and finally Jerry. Lance came into the scene and but it was already over. The Vance men decided to lay low with the drug money they made to take care of their sick brother outside the country. Vice City became the major spot for the drugs trade, it attracted several criminal organizations to be interested, including the Mafia. Liberty City’s Mafia-linked Forelli family sent Tommy Vercetti, who was recently released from prison after a 15-year stay, down “South” to get started with their expansion, with Vercetti as a Forelli representative, just to keep him out of Liberty City. Upon arrival to Vice, Tommy and 2 other men (later learned to be Harry and Lee) met Ken Rosenberg, a bent lawyer with Forelli connections, at the airport. They soon met with the Vance family leaders at the docks to make the deal. However, 3 masked men killed everyone but Tommy, Ken, and Lance who managed to escape without the money and drugs. Tommy informed Sonny Forelli about the incident. An angered Forelli demanded that Tom found his money and drugs immediately and get those responsible for the incident. Rosenberg feared to suffer consequences from the mob and refused to stick his head of his office. Sonny called periodically to check up on Vercetti. A man for information was Kent Paul, who gave info about a chef. Tommy killed Leo Teal, who failed to squeal about the ambush. With nowhere to go, Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez, who also set up the deal, was his way in to find the money. He was at his most expensive yacht. Cortez had a feeling that his right-hand man Gonzales squealed about the deal and was to be killed, and met Lance Vance. Vercetti met Avery Carrington, a Southern gent who was into prime real estate. Tommy met Ricardo Diaz, now a powerful coke baron. After watching a deal, Diaz offered Vercetti work since he liked his style. Soon after working for him, Lance and Tom discovered that Ricardo was responsible for their busted deal. Lance attempted earlier to avenge his brother but failed only to be captured and taken to the city’s junkyard before Tommy came to the rescue. Before they could their revenge, Tommy escorted Colonel Cortez out of the city after a corrupt French government was after Cortez for assigning Tommy to steal their merchandise earlier. The men finally stormed in the Diaz’s mansion grounds and killed the drug master. Diaz trusted and was going to have him made, but he was made by the 2 men. Tommy took over all his local businesses. The Forellis sent Vercetti some support, later forming his own organization in the progress while gaining power. Tommy decided to go solo and form alliances with Cuban (now in feud with a Haitian gang) and biker gangs, including Love Fist. He owned a protection racket, several assets, including the Malibu, a Pole Position strip club, a porn studio, Kaufman Cabs Company, a car dealership shop, a boatyard down the docks, and a printing company, and in progress making acquaintances with other powerful people of the criminal underworld. Through those progresses, he performed robbery on a bank, produced porn films,",0

"""

I really think that you did a great job with this page. There is a large emphasis on application throughout the wiki which has its strengths given the audience. I do think that there are a fe sentence structure issues and some material that would be nice to add. You are the expert in this  stuff so please take my advice, with respect to the content, with a grain of salt.

Introduction
I like the points that you address, as far as versatility and challenges in design. One thing that I think needs a little work is the sentence structure. I noticed that the opening sentence is a hard to read. There is a lot of good stuff in it, but I think that it could be broken up a little bit. I think that the first sentence can be broken up into three different sentences addressing the purpose and challenges in application and decomposition. As it reads it is just a little hard to follow. Also the term breakdown is used several times, and I was wondering if the term decomposition could be used interchangeably. Overall I think that the intro hits all the areas that it should, and the content is good. I do think that it need a little restructuring though.

History
I really found the history of these polymers to be interesting. I think your decision to make history a section was a good choice given the natural quality of a lot of these polymers. One thing that I did not like about the history section in the opening two sentences. I understand what you are trying to say, but I think there may be better ways to say that biodegradable polymers have a been around for a while. If you remove the two sentences I think it would be more fluid. I really like how you covered a large timespan. It is easy to get wrapped up in what is cutting edge, but I think you did a really good job covering as much time as possible and pointing out many things. Nice! 

Structure and properties
This section was really nice. I really like the scheme that you have in the beginning. One nit picky thing I want to point out, is that think that there is a repeat in the first sentence of ester and ester bonds. Also in the first sentence you mention that some of polymers, such as proteins, contain amide bonds.  I think a nice addition to the scheme next to biopolyesters would be biopolyamides and a following box labelled peptides. I notices that you mention it in the next section and it may be a good place to show it in your scheme. I really like the properties section of your article, you address a lot of challenges with respect to degradation.  Another nit picky thing, I think the term impractical  in the third sentence could be changed to something more science like. 

Synthesis
This is section is great. I printed the article off to read it and as I was reading I thought """"They should really include a scheme for polyurethanes."""" and wah la! On the next page at the top there is a scheme for polyurethanes, so what I am trying to say is good placement. 

Mechanism of Breakdown
Another great section. One thing I think you both need to decide on is whether you are going to use the term breakdown, degradation, or decomposition. I see them all throughout, I am not sure which one is more right, but I think that you should agree on one and use it throughout. In the second paragraph there seems to be an error in your wiki language. There is the word oxygen that looks like this: [[oxygen[[. In the paragraph following your scheme, there is a sentence explaining the challenges for enzymes to evolve to accommodate the synthetic polymers. I there really like it and I think it is full of information. Although, I think that this sentence is crucial, I also think that it could be worded better. In this same paragraph there is a sentence that starts with:""""Typically, after physical processes......"""" There seems to be some extra words and the sentence does not quite make sense. 

Applications 
Application section is really nice. I think that medicinal application for these is really interesting and I also think that most people will find this intriguing. I think your section is weighted toward medicinal applications, and I think that is awesome. Now the stuff I thought that could be changed: I think that the first sentence of the second paragraph could be removed completely and the paragraph would be fine. In the third paragraph there is a sentence where you use the term in vitro twice. I think that second usage could be removed. Also, I got a little confused in the example sentence about rat smooth muscle tissue. I really like the term """"holy grail"""", not sure if this was intended to be a monty python reference, but it should of been. Although, I like the term holy grail, I think from a professional stance there may be other terms you could use.

Even so, there is a number of reliable English language sources, such as Agence France Presse stating explicitly his real first name is Miladin, so weaselly worded unsupported claims such as 'run-of-the-mill agency' and 'below the threshold of relevance' ain't gonna cut it. WP:FULLNAME is very clear about the opening paragraph: """"While the article title should generally be the name by which the subject is most commonly known, the subject's full name should be given in the lead paragraph, if known (including middle names, if known, or middle initials)."""".

If I made some error, then why can't someone explain it to me on the Talk page? I am not pushing a POV.

I edited an inflammatory sentence about a Jewish issue in the Schlafly biography page. I think that the sentence is anti-Jewish, but you may have your own opinion. Maybe you think the sentence is pro-Jewish. Either way, the sentence is contrary to WP BLP policy and must be removed immediately, unless it is reliably sourced.

The source is a paragraph in a NY Times book review by a Jewish columnist. Schlafly did not write the book in question, and Schlafly is not Jewish. The book is not about Jews. The paragraph is not backed up by anything. The paragraph is partially explained by the fact that columnist is Jewish and likes to write about Jewish issues. The paragraph is a criticism of the book, and not a criticism of Schlafly.

I think that the sentence is too unsupported and too far removed and too strange to even be included in an article about Schlafly. But if it is going to be there, then it should stick to what the NY Times columnist said. I believe that the sentence in dispute implies something about Schlafly that is not stated in the NY Times book review. That is what I argued on the Talk page, and no one rebutted that argument.

Blocking me is just a way to put a false and defamatory allegation about a living person in a WP article. It is wrong, and those who put this Jew-related allegation in should be blocked, not me.   16:19",0

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of: 1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to list",1

"Last successful Invasion? British democracy?

The opening to this article needs to be completely rewritten. First of all, the last successful invasion was the Norman attack in 1066, which led to the Battle of Hastings. It is not an invasion if you are invited. The English populace asked him to come with an army to dispose of their monarch, James II. How can it be an invasion if you invite someone to come? If someone smashes your windows in, that is burglary. If you invite them in, its not burglary is it? Look at the Texas Revolution. Some blind idiots assume that as an Anglo-American invasion of the Mexican state of Tejas. Yet the Mexican government invited them, so how is it an invasion if you are invited? Also, how is this seen as the birthplace of British democracy. First of all, James II wasn't trying to gain absolute power the way Charles I did. He did not close Parliament for one, and he did not pass laws without the consent of his people. He was unpopular with his subjects because he was Catholic, not because he was trying to assume total power. The birthplace of British democracy was in 1645, in the form of the Battle of Naseby and the culmination of the English Civil War. It was after that war in which British democracy had been born. Never again after that would a monarch try to rule without the consent of his people. James II did nothing of the sort which Charles I did. It was only due to his religious orientations (and thus, ties with the Pope) which made him unpopular. This article needs to be seriously re-written. (82.28.237.200  )",0

 Modern mainstream economics 

The modern mainstream economics section repeats itself a lot.

It opens with """"Mainstream economics begins with the premise that resources are scarce and that it is necessary to choose between competing alternatives.""""  this is a reiteration of something found in the opening of the article - """"the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.""""  Someone must really like repeating that though because later on in this section we see 

""""Economics studies how individuals and societies seek to satisfy needs and wants through incentives, choices, and allocation of scarce resources.""""

Then later in this section we see

""""neoclassical economics, which began to develop in the late 1800s and models choices made in the allocation of scarce resources.""""

Then later in this section

""""It is sometimes referred to as the study of choice under conditions of scarcity.""""

Then later in this section

""""Economics is a broad term given to the social science of how choices are made in face of limited resources.""""

Then later in this section a word for word repetition of what was said in the opening -

""""the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between given ends and scarce means which have alternative uses""""

Reading all of this I conclude that mainstream economics studies the relationship between given ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.

"Purpose

The purpose of operation Flavius was to prevent the bombing of the military band and the purpose of the PIRA cell in Gibraltar, was to place a bomb in a public place to effect that.  Hiding that is a distortion of both the official IRA statement that they were on 'active service' and the inquest verdict.

Its highly regretable that people are shot on our streets, and unlike some places, its not an everyday occurance. Indeed nobody has been shot since - but although there is no crime of 'being Irish in Gibraltar' it remains the position that terrorists can, and will be shot. Although we do not anticipate any more visits from Ireland, due to the proximity to North Africa there are new threats.

One of the NYT articles cited says that the position with Britain is complicated because it does not have a written constitution - this is sloppy journalism because Gibraltar has one and despite a subsequent version, the section which deals with this incident remains 'as was'.",0

""": Orange, Thank you very much for your thoughtful comments. 

 I've read that Wikipedia is interested in the product, not the process. ZZM is obsessed with the process, and presents endless hurdles to improving the product. He constantly quotes Wikipeida policies to me. If I want to make a change, I am violating WP:XXXX, he tells me every time. I understand there is a Wikipedia policy that says """"ignore all rules"""" WP:IAR and another that says, don't be a WP:DICK.

 Of course, the one thing ZZM clains over and over is that his right to do whatever he wants, and for me this behavior is very disruptive, is justified by WP:OWN, that I don't own it. He's can't hold off for a few hours when I ask him, so that I can finish something.  Doesn't this violate WP:DICK? But seriously, WP:OWN is just an excuse for endless circular edit wars, because the answer to I don't own it is that he also doesn't own it. But that brings up one more thing.

You really need to chill out however, because I am afraid either you will be blocked from editing certain articles (along with ZZM, I would hope) or you will get frustrated and refuse to participate (not very mature if you did that).  

You say, """"not very mature if you did that""""? Pardon me, but one thing that I do own is my own life, my own time, and my own abilities. Right now, the article Judaism and evolution is a polished and sourced article from the heading """"Jewish opposition to Darwinian evolution"""" on down. Above that heading, the article is a mess of unsourced quotations, mostly. Those quotations are generally correct, and do give a good sense of what mainstream Jewish opinion is on evolution. But turning what is there now (and all the other material that is available) into a real article is going to be a lot of work. Of course, somebody else could do that work, and somebody else will eventually come along who wants to. But am I """"not mature"""" if I don't want to? No, my life is my life!

Based on my experience with ZayZayEM, who has followed me from one article into several others already, I don't want to work on it. I've got to have a life, celebrate Pesach, visit my aging parents, and more. I'm willing to work on this material if I don't have to deal with ZayZayEM. I welcome the participation of people like you, Shira, Jay, jmabel, IZAK, and others who follow reasonable editing patterns, use Talk pages, and so forth.  

I've tried to talk several of my friends into becoming Wikipedia editors. They are people who could make huge contributions. I know that if any of them ran into ZayZayEM, that would be the end of their contribution to Wikipedia. 

Do you understand my contention that following a person from one article into another and yet another, is a form of stalking, and that it makes me extremely uncomfortable, even if the fellow is halfway around the world? That's why I asked to have my User page sanitized last week. (All old entries to it were erased.) I used to have personal information about my family on that page.

This is a technical question about the MediaWiki software best asked on Wikipedia:Village pump (technical). It's not difficult to do this but it would require code changes.  

I believe this is done in MediaWiki:Monobook.js, with the following lines of code:
var mpTitle = """"Main Page"""";
var isMainPage = (document.title.substr(0, document.title.lastIndexOf("""" - """")) == mpTitle);
var isDiff = (document.location.search && (document.location.search.indexOf(""""diff="""") != -1 || document.location.search.indexOf(""""oldid="""") != -1));
 
if (isMainPage && !isDiff) 
{
document.write('/**/ #lastmod, #siteSub, #contentSub, h1.firstHeading { display: none !important; } /**/');
Correct me if wrong, but I think all you have to do is add these lines to Monobook.js  
This would be good to add to the Main Page FAQ.  (talk contribs ) 

Thanks for all your help. With your input, I was able to google search for the very answer to my solution here. Basically, its like you guys said edit the username:Monobook.js page (or Mediawiki:Monobook.js if you want to change it for the entire site - just search for that page), and append the extra code. My apologies if this posting is located in the wrong area, I simply could not find any other spot to leave this message. Thanks again.  21:15, 7 September 2006

Suggestion
I think that adding a link to the sandbox (in a prominent place, not in the small print) will help new users to find a right place to experiment, and not carry out trial edits on actual pages. My hypothesis is that this will noticeably reduce unconstructive edits falling under the new user test category. Any support for my theory?  
 Firstly I think it's a good thing that random tests can occur in main space. It rams home the fact that wikipedia can be edited by anyone. The only way for some people to believe this is to try it. Secondly, even after the header redesign for this page with the """"red flashing lights"""" many people still don't notice it. But even after my disparigment I'm not against including a link to the sandbox somewhere more prominent, where do you suggest?  
I suggest with the Overview · Searching · Editing · Questions · Help part, the one under the 'Welcome to Wikipedia' box. With a brief explanation of what it's for in brackets, so new users know what it's for and don't get perplexed by what they see as yet another confusing feature of Wikipedia.  
At the moment, at 800x600 pixel resolution, there is no room for any more links in that area.  
OK...how about including it in either the navigation or the toolbox boxes on the left side of the window instead of on the Main Page? That way, the sandbox is accessible anywhere without having to know what to type into the search field or having to go back to the Main Page, which might achieve my aim better since it's less troublesome to go to the sandbox.

Hi Jorgenumata. I liked all the additions you have made. I myself have worked in metals on the physics side, so I can add some things. But actually, for the overall structure, I think it would be useful to discuss some of the ways that MD is used in different fields on the talk page so that we can incorporate the different uses of MD more fully. Most people are focused on their on field, and don't see outside it (me included), so it is kind of hard to incorporate all the different things into one article.
The merge discussion with MM is an example. Metals cannot be modelled by force fields. They are completely incompatible with the force field view of molecules, and from reading the MM page, MM only uses force fields. So it seems impossible to merge the articles. Anyway, enoough of my blabbing. The things that I am interested in knowing are what/how MD is used in different fields.

Fluid/aerodynamics: Do fluid dynamics / aerodynamics people use the billiard-ball approximation of atoms to model fluids, and are these methods considered molecular dynamics if they consider each atom individually?
Metals: We don't use force fields. Generally, TBSMA or equivalent is the least accurate/most empirical that can be used. Tight-binding and ab initio are far more common. Anyway, I can add a lot of metals things myself, so don't need much input here.
Semiconductors: Again, force fields are not used. However, requires very different approximations to metal simulations. Again, I can add stuff to the article on these.
Chemists: What exactly do chemists study? Are the chemical reactions always studied within a solvent, or are they studied on isolated chemical compounds? Is it always important to correctly model the temperature and pressure, or are these secondary considerations in chemical MD simulations?
Bio: Similar to chemistry, are temperature and pressure important? Do proteins get modelled within the context of a solvent, or are conformations studied on the basis of a single protein molecule with no external interactions?
So, I'll try to add some metals and semiconductor things to the article, but I don't want to break the chem/bio side. Will come back in maybe a week and try to do some additions.  09:09, 21 November",0

I reject this notion

The article claims """"The defeat was attributed to massive vote splitting with the Greens, which in many cases allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and win""""  This claim is nonsensical when compared to the fact that the Liberals won 57% of the popular vote province wide.  Even if the remaining 43% had all voted for one party, the Liberals would have likely won anyways.  I personally went through the article and added all the vote totals for the NDP and Green candidates. (exlcuding the richmond and delta ridings because there was no totals)   I could only find 7 cases where, had ALL the voters for the Greens AND ndp voted for the same party, they would have defeated the Liberals.   If this had been the case the Liberals STILL would have had 65 of 72 (the legilature minus richmond and delta) seats versus only 9 for the NDP.  The NDP would still have lost 76.92% of their total seats in the legislature.  

So as a consequence I'm removing that sentence.

  

Well I agree that vote splitting played a role, to attribute the NDP's defeat to this is ludicrous.""",0

It's crazy.  You partisans want your favourite terrorist organisations free of labels, and your enemies' organizations labelled as """"terrorist"""".  Since there are more Jewish and Christian people editing Wikipedia than Muslims, this means that some get the label, and others don't.

Wikipedia welcomes pictures even if they are not from the 'serious' sources. Pictures are the exclusion from the rule that one cannot add a personal content to Wikipedia. I thought the same applies to the link to the websites containing only mere pictures, nothing more and so did www.garycki.com/nationalparks.html  
If the content in Polish on the website www.garycki.com/index.html contradicts the above statement the website can be split between two independent domains (although still mutually linked, why not?) - one of which will be dedicated to the national parks.
I would at least leave the link on the """"List of national parks of Norway"""" pages because you cannot find a better photo guide to ALL national parks in this country, including the planned ones, even on the government www.dirnat.no pages. The same applies to Poland and maybe Sweden (at least to Laponia).

Why Wikipedia Can't Work
Wikipedia claims (or is promoted by its users as) a replacement for the traditional encyclopedia. They frequently compare themselves to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but in reality Wikipedia is not an adequate substitute, let alone a replacement. What's more, because of fundamental problems in Wikipedia's philosophy, design, and operation, it would appear impossible for Wikipedia to ever become such a substitute. 

There are many problems with Wikipedia, some more important than others. I'll discuss only two that have bitten me in the past. 

The Ignorant Edit-Bully
Many people have noted this phenomenon, though I've never seen a good name for it before. In a nutshell, the problem is that a person knowledgable in a given field (but not a regular Wikipedia contributor) notices an obvious error in a page devoted to a topic in that field. They want to be a good citizen, so they edit the page and correct the error. However, within minutes, their correction has been reverted, restoring the error, and if they're particularly unlucky, they may receive a note from the person that reverts their change, accusing them of """"page vandalism"""". 

It seems that there are a large number of Wikipedia devotees or zealots who have little more to do than hang around the Wikipedia site, watching for edits to pages that they've contributed to. Any change to """"their"""" page is taken as a personal insult and instantly reverted, regardless of its merit. What's worse is that the types of people who do this simply do not have the knowledge or intellectual tools to recognize the merit of the contribution. They would appear to typically be young people, perhaps in their first couple of years of college. They have the headstrong ignorance of the young adult, coupled with an insecurity complex that makes them unable to accept that others might have something to contribute that they themselves lack. In """"real life"""" they would be harmless, as they wouldn't be able to stand up to others in a confrontation, but the anonymity and isolation of the internet give them the confidence to become overly assertive. 

So an expert makes a contribution, sees it discarded by someone who obviously has no qualifications to judge it and all the time in the world to get their own way, and the expert simply leaves, never to contribute to Wikipedia again. The quality of many of Wikipedia's articles clearly shows this phenomenon; reading through the edit history of many pages shows it in action, graphically. 

No Editors Means No Sense of the Valuable
Wikipedia prides itself on not relying on professional editors, which they claim makes Wikipedia more egalitarian. However, egalitarianism is not necessarily a desirable quality in a reference work, as the philosophy of everyones contributions being equally valuable is simply untrue in the real world. As Theodore Sturgeon noted, """"ninety percent of everything is [crap]"""". 

This leads to the problem of many of the Wikipedia articles having been created or primarily edited by the """"edit bullies"""" described above: 

They do not necessarily have a broad knowledge of any of the topics they write about. 
They are generally not well-read or broadly-educated, having little context for the particular areas they have studied in any depth. 
They tend to have concentrated their reading on various things of personal interest to them, so they have no sense of proportion or of what is truly significant to the world, versus the trivia that was important to them as teenagers and such 
This results in the Wikipedia in general having laughably large holes in the areas it covers, while having an even more ridiculous amount of spurious detail on subjects that it has no need to cover. My current favourite example: 

Many Wikipedia articles about important historical figures are little more than caricatures, if they have sufficient details to even be called that. Many other important figures are simply not mentioned in Wikipedia at all. A number of months ago, I looked for information on an important North American manufacturing industry figure from the 1980s; he could be considered the most important business person of the decade. I was somewhat shocked to see that there was no article about him at all. Note that I am not identifying him by name; this is because Wikipedia tends to react quickly to correct specific faults only when those particular faults are widely publicized, in order to render that particular critique null. 

So, being a good naive contributor, I created the article. I noted who he was, why he was famous, a few of his most important accomplishments, and I properly notated the article as being a people-related article stub, hoping others would help flesh it out. A few weeks later, I checked back, only to find that the article had been c",0

PS As for Grove, do you have another source which has corroborated Grove's statement.  His is the only paper on the Doji bara famine.  The Doji bara famine, moreover, predates any censuses of British India (which began in 1871).  His mortality statistics are based on methods that are conjectural and not rigorous.  Moreover, Grove is an environmental historian, not a historian of colonial India, and consequently, not able to assign political blame.  Is there any reference in the paper to the administration of British India?  Is there any evidence (by way of political culpability) in the paper to back up this one isolated sentence?  Cherry picking isolated sentences in the one and only paper on a topic (involving less than rigorous methods) is WP:UNDUE.

OK, I just tried to merge Cloud telephony into Web-based VoIP, and it did not work.  The reason is that the intros in both of those articles did not correctly define the concepts.  
 Cloud telephony is a subset of Cloud communications; it means third-party, off-site VoIP services in general.  This includes both web-based and non-web-based VoIP (it could just integrate with conventional telephones as a PBX replacement).
 Web-based VoIP simply uses a web page running a multimedia applet or whatever instead of dedicated non-web VoIP software

I propose merging Cloud telephony into Cloud communications instead; they are both very short and weak and there is substantial overlap.  I tagged both of those articles.

There is no section in Voice over IP into which to merge Web-based VoIP, since it defines a class of client software; though I did add an awkward link from the """"Protocols"""" section.  Clients are described at Comparison of VoIP software.  Web-based software is included there but not necessarily marked as such.  That's another potential merge target, but I don't have any problem leaving web-based VoIP as its own article for a while and letting it grow.  It may be handy to just be able to link there from several other articles. I removed the merge tag from Web-based VoIP for now, but feel free to rekindle the debate if you see fit.    """,0

"Hmm, I must say I find you suggestions quite perplexing. You say that Technocrats are attempting to push they're political ideas, but if you know anything about Technocracy you will know that it is avowedly A-political or Anti-political, so I don't know where you get that idea from. As for your argument that the article shouldn't talk about Technocracy's ideas and goals, etc. well I find that a bizarre suggestion. I mean, every article on Wiki about a specific group would be expected to have info on the ideas, goals and beliefs of that group. That would be like saying that the article on say, the Republican Party (United States) (or any other group we care to mention), shouldn't have any info on what that group advocates. Obviously it should have as much info as possible, the only thing that matters is that it is presented in an accurate and neutral way.
Eh, you said there existed entries on Technocracy in some encyclopaedias, can I ask which ones? As for using them as sources, I don't think we're actually meant to use one encyclopaedia to write another, as that would be getting the info second or third had, and the other encyclopaedias must have eventually derived their knowledge of Technocracy from the movement itself and it's literature, so I see no reason not to simply present that info first had. Besides, I've not seen any online encyclopaedias that have better information about Technocracy than this article, I believe I've seen brief overviews, but nothing of any great detail (of-course if you know of any articles that have potentially useful info, then go ahead and present it). BTW you are correct about Skip, that's what I've been trying to say all along.
Anyway I'm going to bed now, so the protection should be gone by the time I come back and then hopeful, we can get this article back on track.",0

 Bank of America Anonymous 

Anonymous

On March 14, 2011, one or more members of the decentralized collective Anonymous began releasing emails it said were obtained from Bank of America. According to the group (along with recent federal investigations by State Attorneys General, the New York Department of Finance, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau)  the emails document """"corruption and fraud"""" relating to the issue of """"large scale and repeated"""" force placed insurance abuse accelerating home foreclosures and automobile repossessions nationwide.  The source, identified publicly as Brian Penny, is a former LPI Specialist from Balboa Insurance, a firm which used to be owned by the bank, but was sold to Australian Reinsurance Company QBE, who subsequently branded the company QBE First in 2011  in order for the bank to obtain the funds necessary to pay back their Federal loans.

 """"September 11 denial"""", whatever that may mean, has nothing to do with Mr Ahmadinejad! Please care to search on e.g. YouTube (see, let us say, this page) and notice that there are Americans who are propounding conspiracy theories about the September 11 atrocity. Further, I should point out that during his one but last visit to the headquarters of the UN in New York, Mr Ahmadinejad asked to visit the location of Twin Towers (i.e. the Ground Zero), to pay respect to the dead, but the New York authorities declined his request, citing """"security reasons"""" as their reason for declining the request. Be it as it may, to my best knowledge no one has ever denied September 11 happening, however there are some who question the official explanation as to who stood behind the event. It could be that Mr Ahmadinejad has also questioned the official explanation, but there is a world of difference between the denial of the official explanation and the denial of the event itself. Lastly, I should point out that there were also Iranians amongst the dead on September 11. In this connection, you may wish to search for the Iranian feature film The Ziggurat Goddess (about which here), 2004, with Shahab Hosseini in the main role. This film revolves around the life of a young Iranian man who has lost his wife and the only child in the September 11 atrocity, and in fact the film begins with the scenes of the attacks and contains flashbacks of the last telephone conversation that this man has had with his wife and daughter minutes before the first attack in which they were killed.

 E pluribus unum = 13 letters 

Symbolically, the phrase E pluribus unum has 13 letters (as does annuit coeptis). This example of gematria (isopsephy) then represents the 13 colonies becoming the United States. The back of the US 2010 penny features E pluribus unum and a shield with 13 vertical stripes. The back of the US dollar includes these 13 letters among 13 symbolic references to the number 13. - p. 121, The Secret Symbols of the Dollar Bill by David Ovason (Harper Collins, 2004)

The ancient practice of Hebrew gematria/Greek isopsephy/Arabic gematria (and modern Simple[6,74] English[7,74] Gematria[8,74]) appears to primarily concentrate on the gematric sums of words/names, i.e. Sargon=74 (S19+a1+r18g7+o15+n14). But this is actually 'Step 2' of gematria(74). 'Step 1' of gematria(8) is simply counting the number of letters in a word/name/phrase. Because of Latin Numerals not coinciding with their place in the Latin Alphabet, i.e. I does not = 1, Latin Gematria never gave much importance to Step 2 of gematric sum. But the learned Romans and other learned practioners of Latin did recognize Step 1 of counting the Latin letters and giving significance to it. This example of counting the number of letters and giving it importance and can be traced back to Plato's use of """"God is ever a geometer"""", which in Greek - equals 3,1,4,1,5,9 or 3.14159 pi. - Brad Watson, Miami, FL 64.136.26.22  """,0

 Advice Please 

Hello AustralianRupert - I'd like to start updating the """"Air Forces Memorial"""" page and as far as images are concerned have previously placed these directly on the page concerned, but I'm advised this may contravene the wiki self-promotion policy. However if I wait for approval (especially as this is a stub and others may not happen along frequently) the update may take a long-time. I've placed some example images on the discussion page. Is this a case where I could update the page and then have it examined for potential contravention of policy? Better to get approval for such action first rather than after the fact! Thanks for ant help
  

PS: Until recently and for some time the wiki page also carried a link to my single topic web page about the memorial - I'm not so concerned about the possibility of adding this back in although that would I believe add to the wiki page (definitely for others to determine) but you'll see its generally the source of the material I'm proposing to place on wiki & has been of direct interest to families abroad with commemorated relatives.""",0

 Should Robespierre be classified as a liberal? 

As per the articles on more controversial topics such as fascism and Marxism-Leninism, I have noticed that they address the controversies involved in the ideology such as the Holocaust and the Great Purge - it is not POV to address these because they are important parts of history of the ideology. However the controversial elements of the French Revolution seem to be minimalized here - especially in regard to Robespierre.

When I added a picture of Robespierre, a user removed it, and claimed that it was doubtful where Robespierre was a liberal and claims that the Reign of Terror was not liberal. First of all, I believe a strong argument can be made that demonstrates that Robespierre being a Jacobin upheld many classical liberal values - albeit in a contorted way like Stalin's sociopathic version of Marxism. In Robespierre: The Voice of Virtue, that seeks to describe Robespierre not merely as a tyrant but as a man with genuine beliefs, it describes Robespierre as being a proponent of universal suffrage, of being an abolitionist (seeking to end slavery). Robespierre was part of a revolution that was associated with many classical liberal goals. Robespierre's Reign of Terror against the Girondists and counter-revolutionaries (both real and suspected) that was pursued according to Robespierre to solidify the revolution. Historian Francois Furet claims the Reign of Terror was deeply ideologically rooted in the idea of promoting """"man's regeneration"""" based on free will and enlightenment, that the Committee of Public Safety promoted that resulted in violence against people suspected of being counterrevolutionaries. The issue of Robespierre's association with liberalism - if he was a liberal or if he was not a liberal - needs to be investigated further here by other users, because regardless of Robespierre's controversies he was an important figure in the Jacobin movement and the French Revolution.

Aminz, moving the article specifically will not really clear the misconception. People who don't want to believe the figures are the same will always do that. But in Wikipedia, we can use the actual name for Isa as the Islamic figure that exists in his own importance. It doesn't mean that if a figure also exists in Christianity too that this figure becomes only an article based on the perspective. Isa in his own self can have an article just like Yeahua and Jesu that do exist. It's not simply one perspective of that same person, it's a different belief and the entire reason why the articles is here in the first place. It isn't simply a fact that because a figure exists in two religions that we can not have the real name of the figure being used as the name. It's not something as little as the English language translation, which like I said is not a good argument since we have many articles named on figures in other languages.

"Parentacide 

Parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. Although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.

Parentacide dates back to Greek mythology, where Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Frued coined the term Oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.

In 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. Although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.

Jeremy Bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. Although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. Being adopted, Bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.",0

"I deeply apologize for overlooking your last two messages of Jan 3 until today.  I'm still new at this and I simply didn't see them, although I certainly should have.

Anyway, your pictures of the Richards building are great!  Some of them, such as the full-height shots of the western service tower and the two towers flanking the main entrance, aren't available anywhere else as far as I know. The porch photos certainly help to illustrate the Vierendeel trusses that support each floor.  This collection of photos will benefit anyone who is studying what is generally considered to be Kahn's breakthrough work.  If you don't mind, I might make minor changes to some of the descriptions.  In particular, you correctly identified the two types of shafts in the photo taken from the garden on the south side, so I would remove the question marks from that description.

If you ever get a chance to visit the Olivetti-Underwood Factory building near Harrisburg, that would be great, especially since that article doesn't have any photos at all.  I suspect, however, that the building will be difficult to photograph.  The standard books on Kahn's work usually include a shot of one of its 72 mushroom-shaped (more-or-less) structural units while it was under construction, one of the entire building taken at an angle from an airplane, and one of the old entrance that was apparently at the northeast corner.  The old entrance seems to have been closed, so from the ground on the outside, options today seem to be limited.  

It still might be possible, however, to take a photo that gives viewers a feel for the size and shape of one of those 72 mushroom units, which would be very helpful.  When I follow the link in that article to the aerial photo of the building, I see that those units might be most visible and accessible from the west side, so perhaps a meaningful photo could be taken of the mushroom unit in the northwest corner of the building.  You would want to emphasize the west side of that mushroom unit, which has an indentation separating it from the next unit to the south, which should help to visualize its shape.  The north side of that mushroom has a triangular protrusion between it and the next mushroom to the east, which I suspect would obscure its shape.  Frankly, I'm not sure how well this will work from the ground, but it is worth a try.  Depending on the light, it might work better to try a similar photo of the mushroom unit on the northeast side of the building, where I think the old entrance used to be, again de-emphasizing the protruding triangle on the east side if possible.

Also, perhaps there is a visitor's area in the entrance lobby where photos of the internal structure of that mushroom unit are permitted?

Good luck, and thanks again.",0

For example, you can provide a Cauchy sequence that 'represents' pi but you cannot find its limit.

Answer to Mütze
Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!!

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:
""""Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article."""".

As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia.

Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly!

Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens.

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze.

So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far.

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia!

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page:
""""Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers."""".
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles!

So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia!

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively!

So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody.

Following up on the comment """"as far as I can tell the ITSMPA is no different"""", a quick WP:GOOGLETEST shows ITSMPA→2,000 hits, itSMF→577,000 hits, ISACA→538,000, PMI.ORG→432,000. These numbers seem to show a distinct disparity in notability.—  
Oppose: Peer forums with over 1000 members could potentially provide information beyond what the article would contain if it was a featured article. However, from what I can tell, even the peer forums require a paid membership. The free basic membership doesn't give you any more access on the website than is available to the general public. I think that means this fails WP:ELNO #6: """"Links to sites that require payment or registration to view the relevant content, unless the site itself is the subject of the article, or the link is a convenience link to a citation."""" Even if I'm reading it wrong and the free membership does give you access to training and forums, that still fails as that means it requires registration.   }}""",0

 RM text from Criticism section 

I have been bold enough to remove the following text from the Criticism section: """"In 1944, Tito signed a the decree that ordered the government confiscation of all property, without compensation, of Yugoslavia’s ethnic Germans” [73] and “an additional law, promulgated in Belgrade on February 6, 1945, cancelled the Yugoslav citizenship of the country’s ethnic Germans” [74].
Reasoning: 
1) It's culled directly from a text written by Sunić for the IHR here; 
2) As we have seen previously with other parts of the Criticism section, it makes a complete dog's breakfast of the facts. There was no """"additional law"""". The AVNOJ decree of 21 Nov 1944 was passed into law by the Belgrade decision of 6 Feb 1945. It was the same thing. If you are interested, what the AVNOJ decision actually said was this: """"‘Decision on the transition of enemy property into state ownership, on state administration over the property of absent persons, and on sequestration of property forcibly appropriated by occupation authorities’. Article 1 of the mentioned decision states precisely the status of ethnic Germans: """"To be transferred into state ownership on the day this Decision becomes effective: 1. All property of the German Reich and its citizens situated on the territory of Yugoslavia; 2. All property owned by persons of German nationality, with the exception of those Germans who were members of the National Liberation Army and Yugoslav partisan formations, or are citizens of a neutral country who displayed no animosity during enemy occupation; 3. All property of war criminals and their accomplices, with no regard to nationality...."""". Full details can be found here; 
3) It's untrue that Nov 44 decree/Feb 45 law """"cancelled the Yugoslav citizenship of the country’s ethnic Germans"""" - this happened later, in the summer of 1945, through their loss of voting rights. Specifically, the Provisional Plenary Assembly of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia passed a citizenship law on 23 August 1945 which stipulated in article 16 that members of those nationalities “whose states had taken part in the war against the peoples of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, and who, during or before the war, by disloyal  behaviour, had violated the national and public interests of the peoples of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, and hence their duty as citizens thereof”, could be deprived of their Yugoslavian citizenship - it's here; 
4) It's quite hard to see how any of the stuff in question here can be converted into criticism of Tito.   """,0

Circumcision   
 
Quote from Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem: Keter publishers limited, 1972)   
   
""""In 1843, the clerical leaders of the Reform movement in Frankfort sought to abolish circumcision among their adherents; the controversy concerning its necessity in Judaism lasted 20 years and eventually spread to America. They based their objections to circumcision on five reasons (among which two directly refer to the Ten Commandments): (1) It was commanded to Abraham and not to Moses... (2) It is only mentioned only once in the Mosaic law; it is not repeated in Deuteronomy... All (their) reasons were answered by Orthodox rabbinical authorities. To counter this agitation, Leopold Zunz wrote his essay on circumcision (Gutachten ueber did Beschneidung, Frankfort, 1843). Today, most Reform Jews have their children circumcised. It is, however, often done by a surgeon with a rabbi in attendance to say the prayers, or without any ceremony at all."""" (see discussion for more information)

Jareth: Question re: the Straw Poll """"Discussion"""" Section
I am confused.

I think this is only fair .. that ALL should be represented!!"""" AND in her first entry under """"Straw Poll-Discussion"""" she said: """"I think that EACH registry willing to issue papers for the Shiloh Shepherd should be included!!""""  

But in her 2nd entry in """"Straw Poll-Discussion"""" above, she says: """"If you read this & the ISSR rules carefully, dogs that do NOT meet the specific requirements set by the ISSR cannot get BREEDING PAPERS ... PERIOD!!.""""

Yes, this does seem entirely contradictory to her earlier two statements. Maybe what she meant to say was """"ISSR dogs that do NOT meet the specific requirements set by the ISSR cannot get ISSR BREEDING PAPERS...PERIOD!!!.""""  If that's the case, okay, that's a rule of the ISSR and the NSBR, TSSR, and SSBA registries/clubs respect her right to determine her registry/club rules as she sees fit and are very comfortable with the idea that they no longer want their dogs affiliated with the ISSR. But how is that particular ISSR requirement post at all relevant or appropriate to the Straw Poll (i.e. the listing of registries in this article)particularly in light of the fact that Ms. Barber has already very clearly """"voted"""" twice that she would like to see all registries listing Shiloh Shepherds be included?

I also respectfully support requesting that Ms. Barber calmly clarify her position one way or the other and that any other extraneous remarks (by anyone), not related directly to your specific questions in the Straw Poll, be posted in a more appropriate place.  This way, we can all view the poll results clearly and move positively and respectfully move forward towards resolution.  Thank you.Miles D.""",0

Often, these are included in an expansion pack; or can be downloaded as player-created scenarios, etc. The use of """"feature''"""" in the sentence might be accurate, but is a somewhat weasel-deceptive. ~Eric F 184.76.225.106  """,0

Notability of Your New Heart
 A tag has been placed on Your New Heart requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.    20:03, 18""",0

I agree that Stevietheman's suggestion is the most appropriate to implement. JHP, if you're talking about the 14:54, 27 June 2007 24.209.30.113 (edit #141014976) entry that I reverted, it is because the content was taken directly from the Incidents page without any regard for either (a) including the references themselves, or (b) not following the WP:BLP policy that was taking place over on that page regarding this specific incident.  If you're talking about the 22:32, 2 July 2007 Realkyhick (edit #142152748) entry that I reverted, it's because the entry contained information that was already outdated by information that was updated in the Incidents page, and the link to the Incidents page was also removed by Realkyhick at that time.  If you're talking about your edit #147620955 from the 29th, that was just a copy of the same info from the Incidents page, poorly included, and badly placed in the article  while we all agree that there should be some mention of the incident, including it in the intro section isn't really appropriate either, especially as it (in essence) duplicated information that was posted further down the page.

"While it may be true that there are thousands of trolls for Richard Kastle and Lang Lang... there is a huge difference. Although Lang Lang does (visually) look like an idiot when he performs with his weird facial expressions and over exaggerated face... he still happens to be a brilliant pianist (in the pieces where he doesn't decide to go 10 times the speed as directed.) 

Richard Kastle however as far as I (or many other people have tried) know has never had a single CD published or recorded. The fact that on the entirety of YouTube there is about 30 seconds of actual footage of Richard Kastle playing and a still shot of him on a Jay Leno show. 

Many of the so called 'trolls' that abuse Richard Kastle have a right to do so, due to the fact that a couple of psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time are truly wrong. There is also video footage on YouTube of a guy (who I believe is Kastle) discrediting major pianists such as Horowitz and Cziffra because they 'supposedly' simplified parts of their repertoire. This is completely NOT true due to the fact that University Professionals and other Professional Pianists would easily have picked up such a disregard for the music, in seconds. 

This article on Richard Kastle should be deleted due to the fact that it is just another excuse for one of those psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time, to brag about a man who does not deserve the credit he deserves. If it IS true that Kastle did actually discredit the great pianists - this page should be taken down for praising a slander who has the audacity to verbally abuse the good name and brilliant talent of the pianists who are deceased and have no way of discrediting this so called fraud called 'Richard Kastle'.

I am having an issue. On the 26th of august the following statement was removed from the Foresters Falls, Ontario article: Foresters Falls is now a small community having digressed significantly since the invention of motorized transport. 
This information was removed without any explanation. Because it is a factual peice of information I replaced it (aug 28th) and for safety sake put the book I had gotten it from as a referance. I explained my edit as """"Facts are facts"""". I imagined that the matter would end here. Why would anyone insist on its removal after this point? The next day I saw that it had been removed again by the same user who explained """"if it's a fact cite a reliable source"""". A simple enough request. I thought I had already done that but no matter. I renamed referances as sources, re-added the sentance again, explained this and left it. Within the hour my edit had been reverted and a message left on my user board saying """"Your change to the page Foresters Falls, Ontario was determined to be unhelpful, and has been reverted"""". Needless to say I was a bit upset. Who determined this? who's POV about Foresters Falls is more important? What criteria are being used?

has the community not gotten smaller? 
was it not caused by the automobile? 
have I not sourced the statement as asked? 
is it not a fact? 
is it not information? 
does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? 
is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? 
is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not? 
Why it is better to not have the statement than to have it? 
Does this information not answers a pertinant question left open by the article? 
If I were to refrase the sentance would that be better? 
What criteria was used to determine that it should be removed? 
Why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement?

Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

it's not worth it to try to dispute with someone who is enemy of afghanistan. you should realize that there are many admininstrators who also view afghanistan as an enemy because of what happened after 9-11 and so on. this affects everything here, my friendly advice to you is to let these vandals write whatever they want. searching for trustful sources, reading and learning is the best fun. however, disputing with these people is the worst thing, it will create tension and make you very frustrated, and that is what they want you to be. don't force people to learn if they don't wanna learn. i say, let people remain stupid if that is what they want. i know these vandals from another place online, they are pure racist group, anti-afghanistan, anti-afghan, anti-pashtun, anti-karzai, anti-government of afghanistan. they are religiously """"shias"""", one of them is crippled who rides in a wheel chair, his dad was killed in afghanistan in tha past and he is using that against afghanistan. since that one is crippled, he has nothing else in life but to stay home all the time and falsify afghanistan related articles as a way to take his personal revenge for his father.

"Request for reconsideration:  Deletion of Bullshido.net entry 

Requesting you re-examine the arguments in [], as per WP:DRV.

Your summary of my argument is factually false.  My argument was that the addition of four [more [reliable sources should carry weight.  The statement that the Real Fighter article was not neutral based upon some colorful language suggests your inexperience with publications about mixed martial arts.  Also, you gave us no time whatever to contact Sean Treanor and learn more from him; in any case, an article hosted on Stanford's Graduate Program in Journalism webpage, and not on a student's personal website within stanford.edu, could hardly have failed to undergo peer review or professorial supervision.

Furthermore, regarding the Real Fighter article, , the President of the American Sambo Association, took time out of his day to inform the discussion about how the article got produced:

My name is Stephen Koepfer and I wrote the original Bullshido article/investigation on Geraci. I wanted to share my account regarding how the RF acticle came into being, since my name has come up here. Sacha Feinman, a noted journalist http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sacha-feinman/17/400/976 contacted me about writing an article about Geraci. He was, as any good journalist would be, concerned with not simply regurgitating our investigation. However, reading my article, he felt it was well written, ivestigated, etc. He felt it would be a good springboard for further investigation. So, I provided all my sources to Feinman. He vetted the entire Bullshido piece, found it to be verifiable, and continued to investigate the case in further directions which Bullshido had not covered. As Feinman noted himself it was the Bullshido article which formed the basis for his own further investigation. Feinman and I did not collaborate on his article, other than my making introductions to sources and the subject, Geraci. Feinman was not paid by Bullshido, nor is he even a member of the site. He came to us because of our notability. I fail to see how the RF article, regardless of how much or little it sepcifically mentions Bullshido in print, could not be considered a notable reference for Bullshido. Our ivnestigation served as the springboard for his, he came to us because of our notability, he personally stated this as such, and the subject of the investigation itself (Geraci) is quoted in the RF article as saying the Bullshido investigation was accurate.

This addresses both the neutrality and the reliability issues, and you didn't mention it in your summary. Nor did you mention Carol Kaur's well-reasoned argument, which contained novel points to which no one had a reasonable answer.

The only policies on which you seemed to be amenable to a flexible reading were those involving the definition of consensus.  If Bullshido's similarity to an epithet is no grounds for considering its lack of coverage in a different light, neither are the repeated calls for deletion a basis on which to go with an impossibly loose definition of consensus.

I respectfully submit that your summary of consensus was factually wrong on several points, and ask you to reconsider.",0

What you're doing is finding materials that regurgitate either the Court's dissent or arguments in dissent and posting them under """"Controversy"""".

I appreciate not everyone is pleased with the Court's decision.

The place for their arguments is either before the entire Circuit Court if it grants a hearing, or before the Supreme Court if it goes there.

For example, Chemerinsky's rejection of the Court's plain English decision doesn't deserve a full paragraph. Chemerinsky has an argument, the Court considered it as proposed by the parties and amici curae, and rejected it. He, and you, should accept that and gear up for the next hearing, if any.

 Working It Out Tour 2010-2011 

The Working it out Tour started in 2010 with Traci K Shoop taking it to the next level of fitness.  By adding music with muscle and modeling.  She presented herself through the east coast and some west promoting health and music.  Presented in part for association FPLA to raise money  helping with her in transition and team artists and athletes become members to showcase to be promoted.  Traci's music was a hit on her teaser song Kiss me love me...with holiday added starting in December featuring her very first christmas album """" Tis the Season to be Sexy"""".  This album earned her credentials for a peoples choice nomination where voted amongst some of the top pop artists like Susan Doyle and Mariah Carey.  In this tour she went around presenting a way to help with hard times by giving back to support her coming back out from supporting the troops.  It landed her even top awards with Karaoke social networks. When making the top charts in with her """" Be My Santa BAby"""" it inspired her to bring out for the tour for kisses with the United States Entertainment organization with the service members.  With allowing her to get a chance to mission to meet and greet soldiers during the war time to give morale and become a long distance pen pal.  She herself committed 14 years as a spouse and served under contract training soldiers and families during the times when most effected by stress and abandonment.  Traci's goal as an artist and pro athlete was to bring as many people on the team to help with promoting them during transitional times asking other non service artists who were working to try and contribute financially or through contributions.  But to also honor the ones who like her served not under combat but through missions and it earned her loyality pin, coins and awards with national congressional committes. Where she placed on the board. The true inspiration to push to try and break from the low income of serving and being honored and recognized truly with demanding to be heard.  This tour was of course a struggle with many of the financial reasons and not allowing to spread the truth of what really goes on and how it effects families.  The way some are not truly appreciated on both ends when helping while others in the entertainment receive huge amounts of money and media exposure with little to ever be left for the ones who also work for their freedom.  To also showcase true health and fitness through the arts and science of things.  Which actually helped land her first emmy nomination in two categories in 2010.  

And also nominations with the carolina music awards and the independent music awards.

STOP DELETING MY ADDITION.  You, Muboshgu/Mephistophelian say:

Please do not use talk pages ... for general discussion of the topic. They are
for discussion related to improving the article. They are not to be used as a
forum or chat. If you continue to use talk pages as you do, you may be blocked
from editing. You are using the talk page to push a POV rather than addressing
the article in a constructive manner. Please stop.

I AM NOT """"generally discussing a topic"""", I AM NOT """"chatting"""". I AM NOT   
""""pushing a P.O.V."""".  If you do not understand basic English grammar, you have
no business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context to
separate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a
""""general discussion"""" or """"chatting"""" or a """"point of view"""".  It is a technically
precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.  

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help. It is always a good idea to explain your views; it
is less helpful for you to voice an opinion on something and not explain why  
you hold it. Explaining why you have a certain opinion helps to demonstrate
its validity to others and reach consensus.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;
 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion by other
editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, threatening people with """"admins you  
know"""" or having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 Editing  or even removing  others' comments is sometimes allowed. But you 
should exercise caution in doing so, and normally stop if there is any
objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in 
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT  
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States.

Dear Nlitement,
Unfortunately your point of view is not correct. I won't say it is hypocrisy though, it might be rude... 
I am not, but you are, comparing these two incidents... What I am saying is in these two cases Europian has different standards. I cannot see what is hard for you to see in this? By the way I am not supporting what has happened in some muslim countries. That is wrong too. I do not have double standars...  

 AfD for Firearms (computer game) 

Please consider removing your AfD request for the firearms computer game. It's a highly notable mod: It won PC Gamer's mod of the year, was released on CD from valve, and at one point in time was the #3 most played halflife mod (before DoD came out, and that pushed it back to #4). It's been around for years. I notice from your user page you state you are only 13 years old. Firearms would have been largely before your time. Please see forums.worldatwarmod.com and check the Firearms section for evidence of notability. Thanks.  SWATJester  Ready  Aim  Fire!

As per your comments here, it's obvious you flooded AfD with several mod articles as retaliation for your article being nominated. This is unnacceptable behavior, and if you continue to show such aggression, you may be blocked in the future.  
Call it what you want, the fact is you basically admit to doing it to prove a point in SEVERAL places. Whatever your reasoning for it is, the plain fact is that its against wikipedia policy, no matter how you sugercoat it.  
 Hi 
I would like to ask one person who voted on True Combat: Elite deleting. Do you even play games? Have you even heard about the mod? Have you checked anything about it? Have you seen my phat and big comment where I mentioned a lot of obvious reasons for notability. You don't have to answer. I know the answer.  [talk] 
Since I voted, further evidence of notability has been added so I have changed to a keep vote.  

On the same subject, the article was kept per the afd, but you might want to establish the notability further on the article itself (by including some references to it on notable sites etc.) so that someone else won't just nominate it again in a few weeks. Thanks. -

So you wrote yourself: this article is more than just recognition. I write that it is also about illegal precedent... if not only about it. I myself comprehend the term recognition as a term which explains a process. Wiktionary for the english language for (Wikt:recognition) states as the first definition that it is an act or condition of being recognized, whereas wikt:recognize explains this transitive verb as To match something or someone which one currently perceives to a memory of some previous encounter with the same entity. So if we follow the literate meaning we could conclude that to make an act of recognition or come to the state of recognition one should match sth... ...with the same entity. What should should be matched here: eventual Kosovo independence with independence of othere countries. If there are some lists, which you mention, then there are lists of independent (or better nondependant) countries and other entities. Since there is a dispute whether Kosovo should be in one list or some other, some major (as in comparative of lat. magnus - en. bigger) thoughts could be given here. If you mention moving (from one list to the other, than you intuitively agree with me that there could be a POV that a process could exist, or not. Moving, by itself, is a dynamic category (Aristotel discussed this issue long ago), so it could be perceived and comprehended as a process. All this is much simpler (at least for me) to comprehend and explain in serbian language, since serbian language has svršeni and nesvršeni vid of a verb which adds to a bit more refined expression of thought, if I may be so language-subjective. Sorry if I offended you somehow, by quoting your words or in any other way, it wasn't my intention. I will conclude in hope that my too elaborate essay (I may call it now so -) ), constructively adds to comming into terms and resolving the current dispute on the article's content and title.

You cannot just go out and make a Lord of the Rings film without the required licensing, since all LOTR films are made from the same intellectual property. The Peter Jackson series is not a franchise, it is one instance of an independently produced series in a franchise that includes multiple adaptations across multiple media. Batman is similar: Batman is a franchise that includes comics, multiple independent adaptations and merchandise. We could just have a chart of each independent series, but that would mean separating the Batman films, separating the Spider-Man films etc, but the chart does this anyway, because you can just expand the entries. The article retains a neutral point of view on what data we present, since readers may be just as interested in the collective value of the whole Batman franchise as opposed to just one series in it; on the other hand, they must just be interested in the Nolan series. Either way it doesn't matter because both sets of data are given. Likewise with the Middle Earth films, the reader has access to how much the franchise has earned as a whole, how much the Jackson series has earned as a whole, and how much just the LOTR trilogy within the Jackson series has earned as a whole. It covers all possible ways a reader might want to interpret the information.

 Coup not Revolution 

First off, I removed the reference to """"after Yanukovich fled the country"""".  The term """"fled"""" is loaded and POV.  To say he """"left"""" the country is non-POV... but the statement added zero value in the first place.  Second, let's talk about some English language usage for all the Ukrainians on here, specifically the difference between literal and figurative language:

Revolution:  """"A fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time.""""

Coup:  """"The sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body, civil or military.""""

Let me explain the difference clearly.  A revolution occurs when forces abolish government power structures.  This clearly did not occur.  A coup occurs when one faction of the government seizes control of the existing power structures.  This clearly did occur.

There was no revolution in Ukraine.  There was only a coup.  This position is non-POV and sustainable.  I recommend:  """"Maidan Coup"""" or """"2014 Ukrainian Coup""""... but the term """"Ukrainian Revolution"""" is both POV and misleading.

Note:  Above I use the literal definition of 'Revolution' to mean the violent overthrow of government power structures (e.g. the American Revolution).  Revolution also has a figurative definition of 'wide-ranging change' (e.g. the 'industrial revolution').

  Applying a figurative term that is not literally true is necessarily POV.  For example, neither the """"Velvet Revolution"""" nor the """"Orange Revolution"""" were literal revolutions and their names are POV and misleading.  In both cases these monikers were coined by dissidents.  I recognize that these are the terms that are widely used to refer to these events and, having become widely recognized, are appropriate titles in Wikipedia.  That does not change the fact that they are POV.  Nor does it change the fact that, in this case, there is no widely recognized name for these events that would justify such POV naming.  I reiterate that the appropriate title is """"Maidan Coup"""" or """"2014 Ukrainian Coup""""  173.79.251.253  """,0

As far as I've read, the false ideas of usage usually pertain to expressions that have not been in the standard language for long, but in a dialect form for longer. Sometimes even a usage might die out and then be revived again, to be defended on its age. Would not it not be clearer to elaborate on """"linguistic matters""""?

 Institute for American Values 
Mr Blankenhorn is the founder and president of the Institute for American Values that institute, at time of me writing this, has no article, even though it is Notable and it is linked to by a good number of other en-wikipedia articles.

 The IAV's actual web site, of course (and mission statements there, etc)
 The NY Daily News's search results on """"Institute for American Values"""", some of which are articles by Mr Blankenhorn, some mentioning or quoting him, or mentioning the IAV, and some are just false hits that have nothing to do with this.

"US States name game is a terrible example 

Due to the limited number of states, this game would be over almost as quickly as it started.  Why?  Consider:
Over 40% (21 out of 50) of states end in the letter 'A'.  Of the four states that start in 'A', three (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona) also end in 'A', and the fourth, Arkansas, would lead you to either South Carolina or South Dakota, both of which end in 'A', and thus you'd be stuck in an endless loop of 6 states from which you cannot escape.  This loop is almost completely unavoidable.  The example given in the article is already stuck in this loop.
Almost as many (18 states) start with a letter that no other state ends in.  So the only way these states would ever come up in gameplay is if you started with them.  Of these states, we also have the only state ending in a 'T' (Connecticut) and the only state ending in an 'H' (Utah).  Thus, you can add Hawaii, Tennessee, and Texas to the list of states that will almost never come up.
The only way you won't end up stuck in the endless 'A'-loop is if you somehow land on one of the five states (Delaware, New Hampshire, Tennessee (unlikely as seen above), Kentucky, and New Jersey) that end in a letter no other state starts with, at which point the game would be over.
There are numerous other pitfalls; consider Ohio.  You could either loop endlessly on Ohio, or go to Oklahoma, thus falling into the 'A'-loop, or you could go to Oregon.  From there you could go to Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and North Dakota, all falling again into the 'A'-loop.  Or you could hit New Hampshire or New Jersey, both game enders, or New Mexico, which just takes you back where you started, or finally New York.  New York then leads to Kentucky (ending the game) or Kansas (falling via South Carolina or South Dakota back into the 'A'-loop yet again.)
Maybe Nations of the World would be a better example.  There's more of them for one thing, though still quite a few ending or starting in 'A' (and again a large number of which both start and end in 'A', so the loop still exists, but it's larger and easier to get out of).  Also, most letters of the alphabet are represented at the beginning or end of at least one country, so you'd be less likely to get stuck, and there aren't so many of them which could never appear.  (A few exist - can't think of any countries ending in 'J', 'V' or 'Z' - sorry Jordan, Vietnam, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, probably more but I'd have to do a more thorough search.)  Anyhow, maybe I'm crazy for noticing stuff like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning.",0

I wanted to start an Article listing the Top Mandarins of Ontario Regional Government and when I started it was shot down for things like copyright violations or that I was somehow pushing a POV by simply listing information, or claiming I was posting a Bio of non-notable people.

I don't see what is wrong with making up such a list. It would basically list only the top Mandarins, the CAO, the Commissioner of Business Services, the Commissioner of Public Works and the Regional Solicitor. This would result in a list of say 24 individuals and can list where the came from to expand the job-stub of Wiki and provide interesting and useful reference information about who is who in government in Ontario Regions. This would not POV anything and simply be a source of information about who and how people get these jobs by listing their past jobs in government positions. Once up it can be expanded and be kind of like a hierarchy of command and control positions. No Bio's on them.

CC vs RCC

I invite you to read it if, for nothing else, the strange sense of deja vu it will likely inspire in you, as it does in me. Cheers."""" 

This it the type of patronizing rhetoric I've received from what I consider at this point, outwardly Anti-Catholic editors in this site.  I know there is a good faith policy, sure, but the repeated disrespect and blatantly forward condescending attitude is just too obvious to conclude anything less.  

I am aware you have supported the change of the article for the proper name """"Catholic Church"""" in the past.  I am determined to have our voice heard again and have this issue reviewed and hopefully repealed.  However, there is no way I can do this myself, I need you help and anyone else that may assist us.  (by the way where the due process ?)

My most significant points for change are found in the one of my latest post as follows:

 """"1)Using a geographic description in addition to the title of a Church has to be one of the poorest excuses. What is not understood is that regardless of additional descriptive properties """"Catholic"""" Church IS the common title of the Petrine Church in the equivalent manner as """"Anglican"""" Church is the common title of the Church of England...regardless of any descriptive meanings of the words """"Catholic or Anglican"""". If anything it proves how inappropriate it is to impose an extrinsic adjective upon an institution that is not titled in such a manner. If that is allowed then where does it end. Why not add to the Greek the Athenian Orthodox Church, or say London Anglican Church since the symbolic head of the Anglican communion resides there.

2)Since """"Catholic Church"""" is NOT a description, but the title of the lone Church titled as such, by far, historically, in the present and by the world at large it deserves to be title as such. It is not ambiguous, Anglicans do not say they are going to the Catholic Church, do they? Thus, no point in pulling out the ambiguity alibi Also, the article describes one Church, it is not a comparative study of several churches, no confusion to be entertained.

3)The personal ignorance of a Catholic which refers to himself as Roman Catholic is not an excuse to go by such a term. Many of these same Catholics are the same ignorant Catholics that think Catholics of other rites are not real Catholics. Thus, ignorance is no reason, if any a reason for proper education.

4)The listing of a Parish as Roman Catholic is reference to the Rite not the Church at large(albeit slang, where """"Roman"""" is interchanged for """"Latin"""") just as Byzantine Catholic churches are frequently listed as Greek Catholic Church. Since this article is discussing the Church at large and not the Rite, the usage within the church by the """"listing"""" excuse does not apply to this article.

5)The Church in the few instances where it does add the descriptive adjective """"Roman"""" it is used in reference to its Petrine primacy and only when describing or comparing the Church with other schimatic churches.  This fact, is perfectly exemplified in Pope Pius XII's encylical Humani Generis where he mearly mentions """"Roman Catholic Church"""" as he speaks of churches not in  full communion. Because, in that entire encyclical Puis referrs to the Church as simply """"The Church"""" vs RCC 46 times to 1.

6)Since, this article is NOT from within the Church there is no way to confirm that it is not mentioned pejoratively, thus the additional push to disregard this disrespectful term.  Face it, the only way to prove an article's description is not meant pejoratively is only if it comes from within the Church. (Wikipedia should not pretend that anti-Catholicism does not exist)

Lastly,Wikipedia is not a Protestant or Anglican outlet. I mean really how many Protestants, Anglicans, or Orthodox refer to themselves as """"Catholic"""", yet that article is presented from the non-Catholic POV(as well as Catholicism). Yet, the Catholic is supposed to shut up and take it - fine, I'll take that for the terms """"Catholic and Catholicism"""". However, we are not allowed the common title of our Church in the name of outlandish excuses, instead the Catholic is supposed to swallow a term imposed by others outside the church, Anti-Catholicism, as is the preferred connotation of those against the Petrine Church.[9] [10] Where are the concessions coming from the non-Catholics?

The injustice is truly preposterous! """"

These all seem to be reasonable solutions, if a little stop-gappy.  I think my problem is that I am seeing this as an outsider to this UK group and the UK group might be seeing the article as a group of insiders writing for insiders.  My initial problem with the article was that it is unclear and allows different incompatible readings.  """"Administrative geography"""" certainly makes the article more consistent, but I'm not sure it makes the title more understandable (unless, of course, you are a geographer or know all the branches of geography).  To benefit neophytes (perhaps I presume too much in thinking this is the intended audience of wikipedia and any other encyclopedia articles) on the subject which this article addresses, I would make the following suggestions.  1) Gut as much of the introduction as possible regarding the four countries and, instead, refer people to that article (since it already exists; which would also resolve some problems people have with repetition between these two articles.  2) Explain what """"administrative geography"""" addresses (e.g., national and local government hierarchies) and how this relates to this article.  3) For the love of God, rename (to whatever is appropriate) the section entitled """"In the UK"""" (or eliminate this title) because it serves no purpose whatsoeverperhaps to """"contemporary administration"""" or something that transitions from """"History""""; although for reasons beyond my comprehension, some people are apparently wedded till death to that vacuous phrase (i.e., In the UK).  4) Move the last paragraph of the Intro (beginning with """"Historically..."""") to the History section or exapnd on the themes it introduces. 5) Identify the referent of """"This structure"""" in the History section (i.e., answer the question, """"What structure?"""").  6) Follow strict style guidelines for the terms """"division[s]"""" and """"subdivision[s]"""" throughout this article if either is a significant concept for this article.  7) Incorporate the """"Parliamentary representation"""" section into the section preceding it.  This would give a structure of [Introduction], History, Contemporary Administration (or whatever), Informal (Sub)Divisions, International (Sub)Divisions. As things stand, having a separate section for informal divisions suggests the rest of the article is about formal divisions, which would be fine if the sections reflected a more transparent and sensible organization to the article currently lacking.

Will he go after the WWE Championship – currently held by Randy Orton – and look to regain the title he never lost in the ring from a man who never beat him for it? Or will Cena look to conquer a different mountain and challenge an old foe, World Heavyweight Champion Edge, or a new kingpin, ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero, for a title he has never worn?""""
Kane's reign """"Then there’s the state of the ECW Championship held by Kane, who was also drafted over to Raw on Monday. Although ECW gained the services of United States Champion Matt Hardy, the Land of the Extreme is now left with no World Champion of their own, and only a one-in-three chance to win it back at Night of Champions... On Sunday, the Big Red Machine will defend the title in a Triple Threat Match against Big Show and Mark Henry. While the World's Largest Athlete remains on SmackDown, the World's Strongest Man was pulled to ECW in Wednesday's Supplemental Draft, and is that brand's chance to bring the title back to the Land of the Extreme. But, if Triple H, Edge and Big Show have an extremely good Night of Champions, SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero could conceivably find her brand the home of all three World Championships, with both Raw and ECW left out in the cold.""""
Morrison's reign (Fast Forward to 3:30) """"These accolades are only fitting of a true champion, and I have an accolade that very few people in sports entertainment can claim. I am a World Champion. I am the new face of ECW. I am the ECW World Heavyweight Champion.""""

Once again, WWE recognized the ECW title to be a world heavyweight championship throughout its existence until the discontinuation of the brand, which resulted in all references pertaining to ECW being removed from WWE programming soon thereafter.

The Cosmology part is not by me. I only corrected some really impossibly wrong aspects that someone inserted on a spree of misguided grandiosity. I really have only fixed false stuff, never really written anything but those pieces in the articles we did together. At one point recently (the other day) I nearly eliminated all the Cosmology section and referenced the God Speaks article instead. Then I thought that was too bold, even though that's what my heart says to do. I didn't want to do something that radical without others. But my feeling is that the God Speaks article is much better than the Cosmology section in the Meher Baba article, and that it should only appear in the God Speaks section. So my feeling is still to toss out much of the stuff on the Baba article and if there is anything good or that we missed move it to the God Speaks article. Also, if there is quarelling over these issues in the future, it won't reflect as badly on the main Meher Baba article as it will be a side article. So that's my vote. Sorry I haven't contributed much yet. I find myself pretty shy when it comes to writing. I mostly just try to keep out stuff that is utterly silly.  21:32",0

 NPOV required  

The article seems to me to lean more towards an """"heroic"""" account of the war than an encyclopedic piece seeking a NPOV.  
For instance the opening sentences of the section Soviet–Finnish relations and politics: 
""""After the Soviet involvement in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, no formal peace treaty was signed. In 1918 and 1919, Finnish volunteer forces conducted two unsuccessful military incursions across the Russian border""""
The Finnish doctrine is embedded in its first sentence, tying """"Soviet involvement"""" in the Civil War  with the idea that it necessitated a """"peace treaty"""", and then using this muddled logic as if it were an a priori justification for Finnish military incursions into Russia. (Russian involvement was perhaps half that of the German involvement and both together accounted for about 10% of the protagonists. 35% more Finns died in the Civil War than in the Winter War)
Orthodox Finnish doctrine riddles the article, even though it contains all the information needed for an NPOV.  The account of Finnish independence for instance fails to mention that the Boshevik's policy was to grant autonomy, stating the event in heroic terms instead: 
""""The outbreak of the First World War and the collapse of the Russian Empire gave Finland a window of opportunity; on 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the nation's independence.""""
Knowing the Boshevik's policy makes such doctrinal heroism ring hollow.
To go through the article and cite every example of the bias and absence of references would take far too long but perhaps one or two more from various angles may make the point clearer. 
The article states: 
""""the Soviet Union changed its foreign policy toward Finland in the late 1930s. The Soviet Union began pursuing the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia"""".
Both parts of this need substantive verifiable reference(s).  What was this change? What form did it take? In what way can it be said that the new Russia was """"pursuing reconquest""""?  Is such a characterisation neutral?  The whole requires contextualisation as history is not a simple cause effect nil sum comic strip equation and there are many drivers for any situation.  In this case the pivotal role of the economic and political policies of the West towards the revolution in Russia (as previously towards the French revolution) need to be plainly set out.  However, from the implied assertions the article segues into a distortion of what would be the core issue imo for an NPOV article: 
""""The Soviet leadership believed that the old empire had ideal security and territorial possessions, and wanted the newly christened city of Leningrad to enjoy a similar security."""".
The """"old empire"""" is implied as being the driver rather than any legitimate security concern even though these concerns are in fact detailed afterwards.  
It seems to me that the key aspect in understanding any of this is the socio-political concept of buffer states.  Again, the article contains all the information required.  It is just that it is presented in a non-NPOV form, and so ends up in the good guy/bad guy shoot out at the OK Corral story of the Finnish doctrine.  
I believe that in the West, the establishment treated Finland as a buffer state, one that stood between it and the influence of the new socialism/communism.  I believe that Finland enjoyed the consequent economic benefits that flowed from this status, and which ended recently with the end of the Cold War.  
When all these things are included and made overt, again adding nothing into the article, the following paragraphs can be seen as the key to understanding how the war broke out.
""""In April 1938, an NKVD agent, Boris Yartsev contacted the Finnish foreign minister Rudolf Holsti and Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, stating that the Soviet Union did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries. The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather """"advance to meet the enemy."""" Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad. Finland refused.   
Notwithstanding what was said at the time, history, in the simplest manner, seems to me to record its verdict on the two parties positions.  Finland's behaviour during WW2 merited her having to pay war reparations.  Russia's assessment of Finland's true position (and intent?) was vindicated.   
In my opinion the NPOV could easily be resolved by some rebalancing of the introduction and by atte",0

"Joseph Eastham High School – images 

Hello Stefan,

Thanks for your notes about five images I've added to the Joseph Eastham High School page.  I designed and drew two of these images myself:
1. The Little Shop of Horrors Ticket was my ticket design.
2. The Superpupil comic was drawn by me.
Should I also send this information to permissions or is it enough to inform you?

3. The Barry Island 'Postcard' illustration from school magazine was by another teacher at the school, John Jordan and I'll hopefully be able to get him to send confirmation to Wiki permissions.
4. Similarly, I'll ask Leanda Ryan to send permission for the Lyme Regis circa 1989 photograph.

5. The only problem would be the Profile Magazine Christmas cover by Wai Tsau Wong who left the school in 1988, I've no idea where she is now. Can anything be done to keep this image in, or do I need to replace it with a credited image?

 I disagree with John F. Lewis regarding his reasons for rejecting the AFC, but not with the outcome.  The article has plenty of references, some of which may well be reliable.  The fact that the references are not properly cited in the article is problematic, but it is a widespread problem throughout Wikipedia and hardly sufficient reason to reject an AFC submission.
 I have discussed this article at length with Itzcoatzin on his talk page and will reiterate my views here.  This article is not appropriate for Wikipedia because it is unfocused and overly broad.  It does not present a clear narrative of the progress of a family through history, but rather presents a scatter-shot of ideas, many of which are irrelevant to the Zambrano family history.  One may refer to the discussion at Itzcoatzin's talk page for a fuller understanding of the issues that have been discussed.
 John, I have noted that you are a relatively recent editor, and that you have concentrated your efforts on AFC reviews, largely rejecting them for lack of reliable sources, even when sources are given.  While inline citations are certainly preferred, they are not a requirement of a start-class article.

 Proposal 

I propose a solution to the issue posed by the guideline regarding disambiguation pages (and the resulting AfD): keep the article, and simply remove """"(disambiguation)"""" from the article title. Thus, this would become the article Apartheid, with a short definition and citation to the Afrikaans origin, and then links to the various usages, with History of South Africa in the apartheid era being the first and most prominent link, with the others following, retaining the language about usage being an analogy to South African apartheid. 

This solves the disambiguation guideline issue. I don't believe there is a consensus to delete this article, and argued in favor of keeping it, but I acknowledge the argument that it is less of a literal/classic disambiguation page and more of a """"here are some uses of the term which have Wikipedia articles"""" page. I believe there are a number of precedents for that type of page, where a term is discussed in different contexts, some or all of which have individual articles.  """,0

Well, you could also read her bio... Leo's bio, on the other hand, doesn't say anything about a gender, or about the character trying to look like a boy.
It's pretty easy to come up with some evidence that Makoto is a girl, but I've yet to see somebody pull that off with Leo...
something which keeps coming up is that Leo is a boys name. Well considering the she's obviously trying to look like a boy (probably so Kazuya doesn't recognise her so her revenge will be easier to gain - yeah, yeah, speculation) it makes sense that she's actually called Leona and Leo is (a) a shortened version of that and (b) conveniently plays into the tomboy image.
Actually, I could think of a more plausible explanation for the name: if, like you just theorized, Leo wants to stay incognito, I would think she (assuming Leo's a """"she""""... still your theory)'d better change her name... Maybe she's not really called """"Leo"""" at all. Maybe the name is part of the """"boy"""" disguise. 'Seems more logical and simple to me, anyway.
Remember, in Japan tomboys will use """"boku"""" rather than """"watashi"""" and will get called """"kun"""" rather than """"chan"""" - all things that technically explicitly mark them as male.
Not sure why you're saying that... Does Leo refer to himself/herself as """"boku""""? Besides, if Leo is a girl posing as a young man, she could go as far as to call herself """"ore,"""" really...
Anyway... Namco kept Leo out of a list of the Tekken 6 women/girls, and the character has been said to be male several times in Japanese magazines. So if Leo is a girl, she's secretly a girl... and there has been no big reveal as of yet. In fact, there's even a possibility Namco is trying to keep Leo's real gender a riddle and has no intentions of confirming it one way or the other, ever. Yumeji (from the Samurai Spirits series) would be a precedent. 81.56.14.31

How Macedonia can be ambiguous in a list of nations is beyond me, apart from the fact that Macedonia happens to be a disamb. page.

While the idea that the UK is the instigator of the war is delightfully odd, the OP does have a point - the article briefly alludes to the existence of earlier bombing (first para, """"Change of strategy"""") but never explicitly mentions it. However, the official history does explicitly connect the August raids to the start of the Blitz, even if they weren't the sole reason:

It would, of course, be too much to see in these raids on Berlin the whole cause of Hitler's next move; but they unquestionably added to his anger at the activities of Bomber Command. it would not be long now before D-day. What better policy, then, for this final phase, than to enjoy a swift and sweet revenge by hurling the Luftwaffe in force against London. For if the British capital could be reduced to chaos, the task of the invading armies would be enormously simplified (...) 'The British', he screeched, 'drop their bombs indiscriminately and without plan on civilian residential quarters and farms and villages. For three months I did not reply because I believed that they would stop, but in this Mr. Churchill saw a sign of our weakness. The British will know that we are now giving our answer night after night. We shall stop the handiwork of these night pilots.' Three days later, on 7th September, the Luftwaffe abandoned its offensive against the sector stations and began the assault on London. From the point of view of winning the battle, Dowding himself could not have made a more satisfactory decision. (pp. 182-183)

Omitting to mention the British bombing through August, and the theories of a """"revenge for Berlin"""" motive, seems a bit strange.   """,0

"Uncertainties and mystifications in Wikipedia's global warming articles 

Dear Encyclopaedia, thanks a lot for your offer but I am afraid that it is one that I will have to refuse because it seems as a waste of time. While I admire Wikipedia as an amazing resource that beats most classical encyclopedias on most topics, global warming is a topic where it is being made irrational by activists.

In the context of Wikipedia, the most obvious activist who makes it impossible to keep balanced and accurate articles about the climate change, its accuracy, and the certainty or uncertainty of various statements, is William M. Connolley, an official of the British Green Party. The reason why one single activist became so powerful with the topic is that he was spending hours with edit wars on Wikipedia and cared about the topic so much that despite his obvious bias and lousy scientific credentials, he became a kind of administrator on Wikipedia.

 Caspian blue ... Korean-Japanese conflict ... usual MO. 

Thanks, I noticed your note regarding Caspan blue's removal of my message. Their MO really has to be discussed.

I set up the account  purely to document the the abuse of the Wiki system by Caspian blue in support of their ongoing Japanese-Korean conflict at articles such as Yonsei/Severance Hospital or Comfort women, see here . See note of typical edit war, here; .

Caspian themselves are investing an inordinate amount of time exaggerating this whole situation.

The funny thing is, before I started this project, I had no prejudices against Koreans whatsoever and tend to take each person as they come. My issue was solely with the manner and methods """"Caspian blue"""" were employing to take control over topics and waste others time and energy, having experienced similar on other subject matters. 

I do not think that hysteria and racial prejudices have any place in an encyclopedia. 

Its a sorry day when the Wikipedia is dumbed down to fit in with individuals nationalist agendas. 118.16.165.249  """,0

(1)  My motivation in adding this is not a matter for discussion.  The only thing which needs to be discussed here is whether or not it's an appropriate and supportable addition.  A large part of the reason adding a link to this article is such a bone of contention in the Caylee Anthony article is because editors there appear to have difficulty separating how they feel from what is objectively supportable.  (2) No """"back door"""" is necessary.  It is a perfectly acceptable addition to the Caylee Anthony article, and would not even be slightly controversial if the subject was not obscured by emotional hysterics.

RM, in that interview he identifies himself with pantheism and names Baruch Spinoza as another Jewish pantheist. A quick look on Google Books shows that he is often claimed as an atheist, as Northern heard say 1 2 3 4 5. In one 1974 work, Ben-Gurion is called a 'freethinking deist [who] had profound reverence for the Bible' 6. I've not been able to confirm his pantheism anywhere else, but a quote from the man himself should be considered more reliable, even though this may only have been his opinion at the time of the interview (1970). According to source 5, he identified as an atheist during the 1960 census, so perhaps his views changed or were fluctuant. It seems that it's hard to label him as anything, although whatever he was, it looks like he wasn't a theist and rejected traditional religious views of Judaism.   23:20, 23 July 2015",0

"There is a difference between making personal attacks and correcting disinformation. The worst of which I can be accused is attempting to correct disinformation, sometimes a bit impatiently.

(2) The brothers used the same catapult, the same extra boost, as in 1905 in all their witnessed flights performed in 1908. In conclusion more powerful engines were logically not needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Correct, they didn't """"need"""" more powerful engines in 1908, but were probably glad to have them. However, your conclusion that therefore their statements about their previous flights are """"their own fiction"""" is merely your own fanciful opinion, to which you're entitled, but which flies in the face of more than 100 years of published information and, yes, the WB own documentary proof, undisputed by all reputable historians. The 1-minute 45-second flight you mentioned was Wilbur's very first in France; about a month later he flew 90 minutes (after Orville had made hour-long flights in the U.S.).   
 I base all my affirmations on primary sources and not latter judgements. The so called reputed historians are just pro Wright Brothers propagandists who simply selected what they liked from primary sources and made up a nice story for the public, disregarding all evidence that throws serious doubts regarding the claimed 1903-1905 flights.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Interestingly, the primary sources of which you're fond include voluminous amounts of documentation by the WB themselves of their work and their success. Try some affirmation based on that. You're right, though: propaganda does existnot in the writings of respected historians, but in misguided scribblings that sometimes show up on these pages.   

There is mention of the seven """"French"""" engines of 1908 here:  http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6550620m/f260.image.r=wright.langEN. They are intended to be delivered as  """"seven perfect copies"""" of the model brought by the american aviator.   

 Strange picture - On Dec. 14, 1903, W. Wright flew with the two propellers on the left side of the plane, one of them not connected to the engine! 

The picture labeled LC-W86- 20, (see http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wri/item/2001696254/ ) from the Library of Congress, shows W. Wright just after he landed the plane on Dec. 14, 1903, damaging the front-rudder (the canard double wing). The flight was powered but the airplane landed below the altitude where it had taken off. The strange thing about this picture is that the plane (see one of the large size versions of the image) has both propellers on its left side, the leftmost propeller being not connected to the engine. There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity. 

""""There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity."""" Indeed, a perfect description of the posts above and below. I recommend an optometrist.   
Ok. It was my mistake. I was mislead by the optical illusion the image contains. I should have studied the photography more carefully.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138

"my objections 

Informations not accurate are:
 Josip Broz was not a leader but a dictator for a lot of years: 35 years! The word leader means who has democratic election by people, leader is a guidance for spontaneous and free supporters! Broz used violence, repression, terrorism, massacres against jugoslav people and a lot of children in Bleiburg and other places!
 The word dictator is not citated even in the entire article: perhaps Broz was a saint or a religious leader?
 Some sources mention Mihailovic and royalist Serbs as first partisans while some other sources mention Broz and communists as first partisans: citation needed of both in the article!
 OZNA and UDBA are not citated even in the entire article: perhaps these organizations were products of Saint Spirit?
 Terrorism of repression is not citated even in the entire article: perhaps Goli otok an other prisons were in North Pole?
 Ethnic cleansing against Italians and exodus are not citated about foibe massacres!
 Repression of communist Broz's regime was valid for unity of Jugoslavia: this is a supposition. Probably democratic system was most valid for liberty of every single Republic of jugoslav federation and now we could see Jugoslavia united and democratic without wars and we could see italian soldiers in their nation not in Kosovo and Bosnia!

"It was not my intent to editorialize the article on Marcel Lefebvre, but I was trying to correct and add some information about him.  I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.

According to MOS:LEAD, the lead section should be proportional to the article. A three-paragraph lead would be way too long for an article of this length. However, you still should try to include some more information there, as it is a bit short. Include a short bit on her appearances and the critical reaction as noted above.
Concept and creation section looks good now, well done.
Expand or merge the Characterization section into other sections. With it that short, it seems as though you would easily graft it into appearances unless there's more info to be added.
You've met GA Criteria 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 easily.
""""She was once the most trusted advisor for the indecisive politician."""" is unclear. Who are you referring to? (Characterization section)
The article seems a bit short (this is my issue with Criteria 3, broadness). You seem to have covered most of the important bases, but there's not a whole lot of information in each. Some of the sections also cover information that would be better places elsewhere (as previously noted, in addition to mentioning Smart's Emmys in """"Concept and creation"""", it seems that would be better elsewhere or at least belongs in a subsection). Try working on how the article is laid out, and as Judgesurreal suggested, definitely use other articles as templates.

I therefore pointed out the House bill (which you have made absolutely no mention of) had over 120 members supporting it which I belive made it was one of the largest supported foreign bills of the year actually. I don't think it is unreasonable to suggest when a fair chunk of the government of the world's most powerful nation (heavily involved with mediating the naming issue) makes a complaint that severe... it should be completely negated from the article. As for you opinion that it (or a child bill) won't become more binding... my own opinion is that will largely be up to the behavior of FYROM government and whether they """"abstain from any form of `propaganda' against Greece's historical or cultural heritage"""".

This is a pointless argument. Nobody ever makes the choice between progressive and interlaced video at the same line count and refresh rate, because they are applicable to different situations. You might as well say that """"12 bits-per-pixel images reduce the bandwidth to half of 24 bits-per-pixel, for a given resolution"""". This may be true, but it's not likely to be useful, because the 12bpp image simply has half of the 24bpp images's information removed, and so is appropriate for a different set of purposes. – \talk """,0

 America sucks 

Thanks for restricting freedom of speech you dirty red. The US marines who fought for your country would be rolling in their graves. You make me sick. I was simply making the page """"Britain is Better Than America"""" to list valid and clearly logical points. I am disheartened to see that Wikipedia supports restricting freedom of speech and is going against its beliefs of all the information to everyone. Your country has been compared to the country of Germany when Hitler rose to power. Your country is filled with the scum of the earth. I was told to make that page on the differences in British and American English talk page. Doing so was not vandalism. You are a commie pig

""":::::::::Hi Rhodes, 
Please read WP:UNDUE.
I've reveiwed the statement 'Dr. Michael Siedman a Michigan-based otolaryngologist who """"dabbles in herbal medicine"""".' and I believe it encourages a biased view against the subject. The subject in question has two degrees in the field of nutrition and two patents in a similar field. I appreciate the fact that the writer used the words the words 'dabbles in herbal medicine' while writing an article but using it as a basis for the doctor's description, given the majority of articles to the contrary, would be wrong and against wikipedia's policies.
Think what would happen if people chose to replace Bill Gate's qualifications in his wiki entry with some other article that described him as a man who 'dabbled into computers' just because a lone article described him in this light. If you have more than one article with a similar opinion then a case may be made. But basing an entire Wikipedia page on the opinion of only one article is a violation of wiki's rules.

"Fraudulent Law Degree 

It should be fair commentary to note facts in the articles already referenced concerning the REASON Judge Ware told the fabricated story to hundreds of audiences over a twenty-year period after law school.  The reason cited in all of these articles is that this fabricated story is what motivated him to pursue a law career.  Therefore, it is also fair commentary to question whether this same fabrication that he told for 20 years after law school was part of Judge Ware's personal statement in his application to Stanford Law School, as anyone who has ever applied to law school knows that what motivates you to pursue a law career is the CENTRAL QUESTION in one's personal statement.  The lack of a more thorough investigation into whether Judge Ware told the same fabrication in his personal statement to law school is a CRITICAL ITEM that should be part of the commentary, as it is more likely than not that he did tell the same fabricated story, which would make his law degree fraudulent subjecting him to immediate disbarment.  Obviously, those who would know that this fabrication was on his personal statement would have complete power over this judge's career, making him incapable of delivering justice in particular cases if those with power over him want a different result.",0

"I have only just noticed that you are changing the names from common to scientific because you are starting to do the Australian snakes (all of which I am watching). You do have a good argument, although I do not fully agree. The problem is that you are not going about it the wrong way. Since it is policy, you should be first trying to change the policy before mass changes to the encyclopadia. The policies are there to create consistency. All you are doing now is making it more confusing. People expect to find the common names on Wikipedia, because that is the way it is done at the moment. Also, it seems you haven't read the Tree of Life guidelines properly. In it, it says that common names should be used where there are formal common names (such as birds) or there is a relatively unique common name. Otherwise use the scientific names. For example: White's Tree Frog is unique, and therefore the common name should be used. However, if you look at Litoria chloris, the common name cannot be used. Its common name, the Red-eyed Tree Frog has a disambigous page, explaining why that common cannot be used, and states that Red-eyed Tree Frog is not unique. 
The entire issue is trying to account for the most ammount of people. If someone wants information on a snake, writes its common name into the search box, and comes across an article with a strange latin name, they may be off-put and think they wrote the wrong name, and it redirected to the wrong place. Especially if the article did not have a photo. If a scientist wants to look at an article, and puts in the scientific name, and it is redirected to the common name, they will be aware of what the common name is. In fact, you will find that in most scientific papers, they will use the common name, stating the scientific name once in brackets so their is no ambiguity. A lot of articles use the scientific name because their is no common name. There is no other choice, and there is no problem with this. 
Please, bring this up on WP:TOL talk page before changing any more articles. You cannot create consistency yourself, and all you are doing is making it worse. If policy is changed other people can help, and it is possible to get all the articles changed. Policy needs to be followed, otherwise the encyclopaedia becomes a jamble. Thankyou.",0
"""== OldLady Productions ==

History 

OldLady Productions was created in 2007, by their first 2 actors Ryan and Marco. They created OldLady Productions after their first video """" Soccer Battle 2 """".
OldLady Productions then went up to a cast of 5 people. About a year later OldLady Productions fired to of their members ( Daniel and Steven ) and got to new actors ( Marino and Gianni ).
Their most viewed video on youtube was their """" Camp Rock Parody """" video with over 125 000 views after 3 months that it was uploaded. This was a big break for them because 
they never imagined getting anywhere close to that amount of views. Although in reality it is not that many views, for a new video company it was fantastic.

Videos 

We do not know that exact amount of videos that OldLady Productions has due to the fast that they are still under construction. Here are a list of videos we are sure they have released 

- Soccer Battle 2
- Play by the Rules
- American Idiot
- The Prisoner
- Hero Movie
- THE FIGHT OF A LIFETIME ! ! ! ! !
- Ryan V.S Marco
- Nothing
- Fashion Show 08
- Ryan V.S Marco ( part 2 )
- Effects of Bullying
- What happens when you don't play fair !
- The Amazing Jog of 2008
- Detective Movie
- Camp Rock
- How to be a bro !
- Music Battle 2008
- Never Back Down ( training video ) * Parody *
- Chriss Angel
- James Bond

These movies were done for amusement purposes, before OldLady Productions commenced their actual company videos. OldLady productions is planning to create and unveil new and improved movies, starting with * Soccer Battle 3 * You may only be able to see all these videos on the official OldLady productions website. Most of these videos will not be on youtube because they are starting their big outbreak with Soccer Battle 3.

Bonus Videos 

OldLady Productions has also made some bonus videos. Some just being announcement and others behind the scenes. Here is a short list of those videos 

- Soccer Battle 3 ( Production Progress ) = trailer

North Beach in San Francisco is a small community and many people know the story as they wiitnessed it. Here are e-mail addresses of some key witnesses you can contact about this matter of simple fact:
LMCLEARIE7@aol.com Lorna McClearie - she was Gary Zukav's significant other at the time. There is a photo of her and Gary in Space-Time and Beyond II at that time. She is completely aware of the facts. She was there.
lensman137@sbcglobal.net  Kim Burrafato - he was there at the time,
jagdish.mann@gmail.com  Jagdish Mann - he was there at the time,
d14947@gmail.com  David Gladstone - he was there at the time,
rmt@protium.de Randy Tinkerman - he was there at the time,
dwishnie@aol.com - he was there at the time,
sirag@mindspring.com Saul-Paul Sirag - he was there at the time and he also advised Gary on the editing and physics content
fred@fredalanwolf.com  Fred Alan Wolf - he was there at the time
rebeccapaxton@mac.com  Lee Myers - he was there at the time. Lee does not do e-mail, his wife Becky Paxton does it for him.
BTW I never submitted any of my books since 2002 to a regular publisher and I turned down a contract offer from a major German publisher for the German edition of """"Destiny Matrix"""". I will eventually hire a professional writer to cull the popular pieces from all of my books into a popular book that will be published mainstream. These books I am doing now are simply my preliminary sketch books, like Leonardo's - keeping notes for the historical record. As such many people will find them interesting. Also, as I don't need the money, I have not been doing what authors usually do to promote their books. I am too busy creating new content right now. Remember I am in Star Trek and on some major TV Shows and on IPOD Radio with RU Sirius and will be doing more of that bye and bye. If I wanted to go the usual route I could. I simply have not tried because I am not ready to do so. That is the fact.  -)

As every German muscologist and textbook knows, the point of a 'development section' is *not* various varietites of 'thematic modification'  it is *tonal and harmonic instability* after the stability of the second-subject key and before the restoration of the tonic.

 RE: Academics  

The below section under """"Academics"""" as written:

It should be noted that Irvington High School was once not a school with high academic achievements. It has been said that the sole reason for Irvington's recent development in that category is the transfer of students from Weibel Elementary School. However, while it's obvious Weibel Elementary School has made a positive change on Irvington's test scores, Weibel Elementary School is only a small portion of Irvington's students. A much greater possibility is that students from other schools served as examples, and the inspiration was enough to raise Irvington's academic achievement. 

The above passaage is bias and speculative, and should warrant a citation. Student from Weibel Elementary School do not, nor cannot feed directly into Irvington High School. As is the case in any public school system in the United States, unless a student is gifted, elementry school students matriculate into a junior high or middle school, than they move onto high school. 

I recommend that this whole section be stricken. I attended Irvington High School in the early 1990's and the differnece between the Weible neighborhood of Fremont and Irvington disctrict is very little. Both are middle to upper middle class, with the housing tracks in Weibel being slightly newer than the older housing track of Irvington district. While the Weibel neighborhood benefited from the high tax revenues of other parts of mission san jose district, very little seperates the two area other than a larger working class population in the Irvington district as a result of the pre-silcon valley economies in which many autoworkers from Genreal Motors in Fremont, Peterbuilt, Trail Mobile, and Caterpillar in Newark,Ca, and Ford Motors in Milpitas,CA resided in the Irvington district. However, as Unionized laborers these workers made a good wage for the time, maybe as well of a living as those currently in the Weibel neighborhood given inflation and cost of living in California of the 1970's and 1980's. 

If this section should stay it should speak rather to the major re-organzation that took place in the middle to late 90's under the leadership of Principal Gaskill and Vice-Principal (current Principal) Pete Murchison (check spelling). As all of the accolades currently enjoyed by IHS were earned prior the the FUSD reorganization which placed the Weibel neighborhood  in the IHS service area. This can easily be verifyed by crossing the early state-wide and national honors Irvington High School earned in the mid-1990's. Thus, de-bunking the assertion that Weibel neighborhood elemtry school students are responsible for the academic excellence of IHS.""",0

American government is rife with policies designed to encourage or punish specific economic behavior with taxation.  We don't want people to smoke, so we tax the hell out of cigarettes.  Is that economic liberty?  We want people to own property rather than rent, so we let homeowners write off interest, but not renters.

 Islamic Science 

There's been some discussion previously of the need for an article on the History of Islamic Science.  At present there is a small section of that sort in the article on Islamic Science.

There's a real potential for tension there because two different groups are interested in the topic of Islamic Science, and these two groups define it in very different ways. I am concerned that the different assumptions of these two groups may lead to unnecessary conflict, which can be avoided by dividing the present article in two.

 The article """"Islamic science"""" seems to have been founded by advocates of a modern intellectual movement called """"Islamic science,"""" which seeks to establish the practice of science within a particular set of traditional Islamic religious norms. Thus the article defines """"Islamic science [as] science in the context of traditional religious ideas of Islam, including its ethics and philosophy. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a Muslim scientist. This is not the same as science as conducted by Muslims in the secular context"""" (my emphasis).

 Historians of science, on the other hand, find this definition excessively constraining, since we investigate the ways in which scholars within the Islamic world developed scientific ideas through original research and by drawing on and transforming the ideas of their neighbors and predecessors. It really doesn't matter to historians of science whether the particular scientist was Muslim (e.g., al-Khwarizmi), Sabian (e.g., Thabit ibn Qurra), Christian (e.g., Hunain ibn Ishaq), or Jewish (e.g., Hasdai ibn Shaprut), whether he advocated strict adherence to Muslim traditions (e.g. al-Ghazzali) or was critical of tradition and open to the ideas of foreign philosophers (e.g. Averroës), or whether he worked in a religious or secular context. If he studied natural phenomena and worked within the Islamic world, his work fits the historians' broader definition of Islamic science.

These contradictory expectations are likely to lead to conflict in two or more different ways:

 When historians wish to discuss scholars who don't follow traditional Islamic religious norms, while advocates of the modern movement would wish to delete these from the discussion. 

 When advocates of the modern Islamic science movement wish to discuss those modern scholars who contribute to the development of that movement, while historians would wish to delete them as not relevant to the historical development of science in Islamic cultures. 

Rather than go this unhappy route, I propose an amicable divorce, removing the section on the History of Islamic Science (perhaps renamed History of Science in Islam) and making it a separate article under the History of Science portal, and leaving the remaining article on Islamic Science as part of the series of articles on Islam.

Speedy deletion of Emily Bierne
 A tag has been placed on Emily Bierne requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 More on Gay Games VII 

Hi, Kile!  Forgive me for butting in, but I wanted to add an outside perspective...  You and Marc have been discussing some issues that are very tough to deal with in the context of an encyclopedia - and more so in the context of an open encyclopedia that anyone can edit.  You, as the director of the opening ceremonies (among other roles) are probably the best source there is for information on the subject.  But on the other hand, you're only one person, and you're not verifiable - by which I mean, that information is in your head and it isn't possible for anyone else to look it up and corroborate it.  Someone could ask you, but there again, you're only one person.  You can see the difficulties here )

There are a couple references I wanted to point you to that might help clarify the situation.  The first is Wikipedia's policy on Autobiographies - a similar area where the best source of information is the individual themselves.  And to point out how Wikipedia recognizes the issue at the topmost level, the second is the speech at Wikimania 2006 made by Jimmy Wales, the founder of the Wikimedia Foundation.

So those are my outsider's comments - I hope you continue to be a part of Wikipedia, and I hope you'll take a look at Wikisource - putting the speeches you mentioned on that site would be a great asset!

AW, the article is about Ataturks life in a factual historical context. It is about the things he had done in his life. Not about what Kurds think of him.

Let's take Coca-Cola for example, a completely benign subject. If someone said """"Pepsi lover's critique Coke for being too acidic"""" (source:Pepsi lovers magazine)"""" would you consider that part of the history of Coke or part of the history of Pepsi lovers? It certainly is an opinion, that could only be the history of a Pepsi lover because Coke has nothing to with their taste or aspirations of how a cola should be. (sorry for the silly analogy but you get the point I hope). Furthermore, this maybe a fact (it's a fact that someone had this critique of coke), but it's not an historical event, a historical fact, nor is it NPOV. 

Now if you apply this to Kurdish """"criticizms"""", then you would get the same outcome. It's all a matter of taste. And there a millions critiques of Ataturks out there, some being offensive to Kurds. Shall we include those as well?

Not to mention, which Kurds criticized? When did they do this? How many are there? What are their credentials? So you also have a credibility problem here.

Moreover, your sources can't possibly speak for all Kurds. I would be surprised if you could dispute that FACT.

Finally, it is inflammatory and controversial. Yet, you seem to want it in there really badly for some reason which would lead people to """"criticize"""" you, and come to the conclusion you are not working with the best of intentions here. Correct me if I am wrong.  """,0

I've have, in the travels here on Wikipedia, stumbled across some accounts that had been banned, and in each case, the banning notice advise the banned of the lenght of time the ban would be in effect? If not improper, might I be told?

I edited a hidden note to clean it up and expand it in hopes it would then be better understood and accepted because, in the state it was in, it was jumbled and confusing (obviously, such things are IMO). Also, part of the message was put in a hidden note before the word in the principle article (“are”)  that was sought (by other before me) to be protected and to remain unchanged, and part of the hidden note’s message was put behind the word (“are”) in what is a separate hidden note, a factor I saw as being counter-productive, but concerning which I also had an idea in my mind as to why someone might want a word or two – but few words were best IMO  in the part before the word “are.”

Editor EscapeOrbit (the person I understand is claiming that he was threatened) now takes the position that that the hidden note that was edited was near perfect and doing a good job for the many weeks it had been there.EscapeOrbit, in his talk page comment of 14:42, 8 February 2010, wrote ’’”The facts are that this note has been on this article in one fashion or another for some while. . .I believe it is doing the job intended.”’’ http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Queen_(band)&diff;=next&oldid;=342616216  However, the same EscapeOrbit on January 20, 2010, on the talk page for Queen, said ‘’“The ‘were’/’are’ ‘’{please note: this is the same ‘are’ in the principal article mentioned in my paragraph above} ‘’in the lead  and dates in the info box get changed almost daily, and have done so for years.”’’ Please see the full entry in context in the footnotes, where you can see EscapeOrbit is saying this in response to another reader’s encouragement to improve the article so it can be nominated as a Good Article candidate.”I've put in this article for a peer review so that we can analyze what we need to do to improve it. In the next few days I intend to nominate this article as a 'Good Article' candidate, however I feel ‘’’work still needs to be done.’’ I will be making ‘’’major improvements’’’ to the history segment of the article, I feel we also need to develop a Further Reading section and add a lot more citations throughout the article. ‘’’Any contributions, no matter how small, would be sincerely appreciated.’’’ Let's do Freddie proud and get this to Featured Article status. TheStig 
I fear you'll not get very far with a GA nomination while there is still near constant edit warring over whether Queen still exist or not. ‘’’The """"were""""/""""are"""" in the lead and dates in the info box get changed almost daily, and have done so for years.’’’ Is there no where we can get a definite answer that can be cited on this? Escape Orbit   {emphasis added} or the page itself if you prefer. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Queen_(band)#Nationality

The hidden message was, by EscapeOrbit’s own words, having no good effect. We had a written encouragement to improve the article so it could be submitted as a GA candidate (see footnotes). With my edit of 16:43, 7 February 2010,  I included this edit summary: ‘’“expand existing important note with new footnote, both to hopefully have it be more widely accepted, resulting in lesser need to keep reverting these same few words.’’http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queen_(band)&diff;=342506929&oldid;=342389811 The “important note” I addressed in my edit summary is the hidden note concerning the “are.” The purpose, intent, and actual effect was an improvement in the hidden message.

EscapeOrbit’s reason for wanting the language he wants in the hidden note, in spite of the fact that it is not working at all to slow the daily changes to the words in the principle article that we actually both seek to have preserved, is that he personally identifies himself with the phraseology and is on a quest to be personally responsible for having (what are, in his opinion – and interestingly enough I don’t disagree here) British subject matters use British English. He writes about this phrasing, precious to him, that it is ‘’”It is similar to a note that ‘’’I frequently attach to British musical band's articles” ‘’’ ’’ {emphasis added}. He is overly invested in defending the phrasing that by his own statement is not have a positive effect. The problem is that he has posted “frequently” and so, like a beloved child, even though he says it’s not working, he isn’t about to have anyone change his baby.

My changes to the hidden message are those words in bold: “are DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO IS OR WERE. 'Are' is the correct UK ‘’’primary compulsory education reading level’’’",0

 Unprotected 
I'm going to edit based on my comments in Talk:New_anti-Semitism#Sourcing_claims_for_.22Country-specific_incidents so could we discuss them now?  

All the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new anti-Semitism i.e. coming from the left, related to radical anti-Zionism etc.  (talk) 

They may well be, but they are not sourced that way.  

I don't think we can expect the words """"new anti-Semitism"""" to appear in every single report we reference. We've defined it, and we've linked to many sources who are defining it. The definition is:

It is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left. It is characterized by the demonization of the world's only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion. Israel's right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. The Jewish people's right of self-determination is denied. Double standards are applied, whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state. Symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism are used: for example, blood libels are resurrected, the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world, or being in control of other governments, or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. Arab and Islamic anti-Semitism are excused and ignored. Straw-man attacks are made, whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism, and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable, and to deny that there is any such thing as the """"new anti-Semitism."""" All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools, particularly in Europe. It is found in conjunction with anti-Americanism (because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government), anti-Zionism, and the anti-globalization movement.

All the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components, so when we find them, we can offer them as examples, so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-Semitism or attacks on Jews.  (talk) 

My worry is that Livingstone has not been (at least in the sources provided) accused of anti-semitism, and that most of the discussion of Galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters.  Add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism (not reporting others allegations), which is OR (and unwise in the case of Galloway).  The NUS thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so I'd just want to tidy that up.  

Livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-Semitism (got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it), as has Galloway, and without question his supporters. The section talks about it in relation to that election. By all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit, and we can talk later if there are any disagreements.  (talk) 

Slim, whose definition is this?   

All the sources put together. The above are the issues they agree on. It was posted weeks ago.  (talk) 

I think you mean """"all the sources from one side of the argument put together"""".  It's been a while since we discussed this, so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative?   
Sorry, you'll have to look in the archives; they're either there or in the article. By """"all the sources,"""" I mean all the sources who study new anti-Semitism. The above are the elements they appear to agree on.  (talk) 
I'm asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative.  Please respond.  [[User:C",0

"""

I'm just telling facts... One who doesn't take to Krishna consciousness - is most condemned and cannot be delivered for millions of kalpas (kalpa = 1000*10*432000 years):
""""Śrī Caitanya Caritāmṛta Antya 3.255

SYNONYMS

e-vanyāya — in this inundation; ye — anyone who; nā bhāse — does not float; sei — that; jīva — living entity; chāra — most condemned; koṭi-kalpe — in millions of kalpas; kabhu — at any time; tāra — his; nāhika — there is not; nistāra — deliverance.
TRANSLATION

""""Anyone who does not float in this inundation is most condemned. Such a person cannot be delivered for millions of kalpas.
PURPORT

The kalpa is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā (8.17): sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ. One day of Brahmā is called a kalpa. A yuga, or mahā-yuga, consists of 4,320,000 years, and one thousand such mahā-yugas constitute one kalpa. The author of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta says that if one does not take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot be delivered for millions of such kalpas.""""

However, situation is not hopeless - even atheists can be delivered if they take Sri Krishna-Caitanya as Supreme Personality of Godhead:
""""

TRANSLATION

Sweet Water Canyon - Sweet Water Canyon is a fictional story about the trek of a group of pioneers crossing the country in 1859 from a Midwestern town and going west. They traveled together in a wagon train. Dozens of wagon trains had already made it across the country and had pretty well marked the way, if there is such a thing, for those that followed. They traveled by wagon train because the promised railroad going from east to west was far behind schedule and seemed like a distant, hope. It describes one type of hardship and danger the early pioneers had to endure. This is the story of one part of one journey and the impact it had on the entire wagon train. Readers of the Christian faith will find this story especially interesting. ISBN: 978-1-61582-405-2

if the instruction manual was written by GDI, then perhaps they were simply deceived into what the origins of Nod were.  Maybe Kane planted information stating that it was from Africa; or maybe it really WAS from Africa, and Kane's attempts to drum up support in the USSR were unsuccessful.  Regardless, it doesn't seem to conflict, especially if it could be established that the manual was a GDI document, and therefore biased and uninformed.

"I am moving the list of european supporters to here otherwise her biography page gets clogged up with names of supporters. The only support which matters is next year at election 2012. The experts say that Manipuris are backward and need to be educated about democracy. The arab spring has taught the experts that it is the people who need to educate their political masters on what kind of democracy they want. I hope Manipuris at last take the opportunity to free Sharmila and rid Manipur of the black law next year.

On 28 November 2010, UK Green Party leader and European Parliament member Keith Taylor wrote to the Indian government seeking the release of Sharmila and the repeal of the AFSPA. Her main supporter in the European Union is Sir Graham Watson KB MEP  chair of the India/EU delegation of MEPs. He has consistently made interventions on her behalf most recently to Dr J Bhagwati Indian Ambassador to the EU who responded on 1 July 2011 to his request to respond to the death threats made against Irom Sharmila. Indian Ambassadors reference BRU/AMB/48/2011 Embassy of India, 1050 Brussels. He responds only that he understands that Irom Sharmila is a hunger striker and that the modification of AF(SP)A is under consideration. Previously in April 2011 Sri Graham Watson and the EU delegation had tried to visit Manipur but were not allowed to do so by the Indian Authorities. They visit each year this year they were allowed to visit, Delhi, Patna and Mumbai. Although Keith Taylor did write three letters on one occasion he has never responded to further input. Sri Graham Watson and other members of the EU delegation do always respond to further requests for help. For example a Dutch member of the India EU delegation Peter Van Dalen whose special interest group is Dalit and subaltern groups released this press statement for publication at the gathering at her tenth anniversary of fasting in November 2010  Smt Sharon Bowles MEP sent Sharmila a personal letter of support which is now with Sharmila. She had added her personal regret that Sharmila was not nominated for the Sakharov last year due to insufficient support from other MEPs a nomination requires at least 40 MEP signatories. This year's nominations close on 13 September 2010. Another MEP member of the EU/India Delegation has stated that he does not believe Sharmila will be nominated this year either as very few MEPs know of her or Manipur.

The European MEPs were initially brought in by one of her Western campaigners Nicholas Crawford a philosophy student at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge. He also chairs a small student think tank. The Wilberforce Society.

The number of awards, the TV network and the personal opinions of the two people here who insist on a redirect are hugely irrelevant.  Anyone who clicks a link to an article about the actors in either film will link directly to the appropriate film; the disambiguation is a courtesy to anyone who may search for the films without first going to an actor's article.  An insistence on a redirect indicates that you find one of the films somehow more worthy than the other; people don't come here to to navigate personal opinions or biases: they're here for information.

Are you kidding me? I have been blocked for defending myself against a culprit who has been proven as such in far more ways than is humanly possible to count? Even though the idea of Wikipedia certainly is a genuine one, the way it is conducted is ridiculous. Saying my opinion is NOT an attack, and saying what is TRUE is not an attack but certainly just a way to explain things, as I had done very carefully and thoroughly in my text both now and earlier. I will say it again, no matter how you interpret it. Mario Roering is a culprit with only one single aim in life. He wants to destroy the good name and legacy of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation and its president, Kunihiko Tosa. I am the president of this federation in Denmark and Europe, thus I am the center of Mario Roering's attacks and defamation. These are facts, and the list of violations not only here on Wikipedia but nearly everywhere else on the Internet is too long to list anywhere. I have tons of evidence in mails, papers, letters, pdf-files, copies of homepages etc. to back it all up. Personally I got fed up a few years ago because of these endless and ridiculous ways, with which the Wikipedia admins/sysops are handling this situation. So at that time I chose to simply leave Wikipedia as it was, and leave the articles the way they were, full of defamation, lies and propaganda, all put in there by Mario Roering. I gave it a few years, then this year I tried again. It is obvious that neither Mario Roering nor the admins/sysops here at Wikipedia has changed at all. It is the exact same situation as a few years ago. Other webservices, homepages, free webhosting etc. which Mario Roering has exploited for supporting his crusade, in the same way he is exploiting Wikipedia, has all deleted and blocked Mario Roering from using their services after a short presentation of the facts and evidence etc. Only Wikipedia is still indulging Mario Roering in his ways and methods with no regard to his true intentions and what he is doing to our organization and/or myself. The way I have been treated here on Wikipedia I would categorize as pure and utter slander, defamation and harassment, in which the admins/sysops take an active part, though this might not be on purpose?!?!? What Mario Roering is and is doing, there can and is no doubt whatsoever. Blocking me, only shows, that fairness, honesty and rules only apply to a very few list of people here. Taking this matter to any official long time instance/institute of Wikipedia, only ads to the fact, that nothing will ever be done about it, as nobody cares. You are protecting a culprit, who has done nothing else than attacking, ridicule, defame, slander etc. the name of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation, our president, Kunihiko Tosa and myself as the president of Europe/Denmark. I have a born right as a human being to say my opinion, present the evidence as they are, and I have a right to free speech. If none of these basic human rights are treasured here at Wikipedia, it only shows, that people like Mario Roering and his methods of breaking the law, copyright violations, defamation, slander and generally lying and deceiving to reach his goals are what is treasured here at Wikipedia. For 5 years, I have spoken out, bringing to attention this man's lesser morals and lesser ethics, but every time some ignorant admin/sysop run the errands of Mario Roering, as you have done this time, punishing me for defending myself. If Mario Roering would stop his attacks, slander, defamation etc. and if this would be enforced by the sysops/admins here at Wikipedia, this situation would be solved faster than anyone of you can say Christmas. Nobody is trying to stop it, thus, whenever Mario Roering attacks me, I attack back, not every time, but often. Blocking only me, shows only, that fairness does not apply to me, but if justice was to be served, we should both be blocked forever from Wikipedia. As long as nothing is done about Mario Roering, I will continue to do as I have done, and I can assure you, that Mario Roering has, is and always will continue his culprit ways as he has done for the past 5 years. Thus the Wikipedia sysops/admins who are doing nothing to stop it, certainly only put more wood on the fire. There is absolutely no attack intended in these accusations, as they are facts and every time I have mentioned them, I have provided the proof, evidence, links etc. necessary to back up what I have said. Every time Mario Roering opens his """"mouth"""", you all listen and act by blocking me, threatening me or ordering me to take any dispute further using the official channels. When Mario Roering is blocked he only write a short request for having his block removed, and it is granted. Me, I can never do that. Where is the fairness in all of this? I have not taken part in any edit war, on the contrary, I have asked help and I have explain",0

POV language in text about Anthology 1 album cover

1) The cited reference in the current version is just the DVD cover which is a visual image not an independent source about the matter

2) The entire collage on all 3 album covers is full of images that have been torn and overlaid by other images. Not one single image on the 3 covers is in its entirety. 

2) The word """"ripped"""" in the current version of the text is pejorative and implies that there was a motive to be defamatory to Best. That may or may not be the case.   As individuals we can SPECULATE as to whether the removal of Best's head was ill-motivated or simply an artist's way to graphically convey what happened to Best (ie replaced by Starr) - but we can't do that on Wikipedia. We can only present incontrovertible facts.

They are these:

A) All three Anthology album artworks created by Klaus Voormann are in collage style with photographs and visual elements torn and only shown in part. 

B) The part of the Savage Young Beatles record jacket in the centre of the Anthology 1 artwork that is torn is at the corner where Pete Best's face had been.

C)  Where Best's face was on the poster is the face of his successor, Ringo Starr, on the Please Please Me album cover beneath it in the collage. 

D)  Best is seen on the Anthology cover in a separate small photograph standing in front of Aspinall's van parked outside The Cavern. 

E) The cover of Best's album Haymans Green displays the image of Best's face not seen because of the torn album cover seen on the Anthology 1 cover.

I'm okay with Fletcher's approach, frankly.  Yes, there are relevant qualms about calling it a """"mosque"""" since that's not all the planned center would be, but there would be facilities for holding prayers and services, and really the distinction between mosque and prayer room in this sense is a semantic distinction.

i found some material of relevance in Reuven Firestone's work """"Jihad: The Origin of Holy War in Islam"""" (Oxford University Press) related to this current dispute. i wasn't actually looking for it, but came across it while looking for something else. anyway (p. 17):

The meaning of jihad
The semantic meaning of the Arabic term jihād has no relation to holy war or even war in general. It derives, rather from the root j.h.d., the meaning of which is to strive, exert oneself, or take extraordinary pains. Jihād is a verbal noun of the third Arabic form of the root jahada, which is defined classically as """"exerting one's utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of disapprobation."""" 14 Such an object is often categorized in the literature as deriving from one of three sources: a visible enemy, the devil, and aspects of one's own self. There are, therefore, many kinds of jihād, and most have nothing to do with warfare. """"Jihād of the heart,"""" for example, denotes struggle against one's own sinful inclinations, while """"jihād of the tongue"""" requires speaking on behalf of the good and forbidding evil. 15 ...

(removed large quote from a narration about the varying kinds of jihad)

... Muhammad is also credited with saying: """"The best jihād is [speaking] a word of justice to a tyrannical ruler."""" 17 The qualifying phrase """"in the path of God"""" (fi sabīl Allah) specifically distinguishes the activity of jihād as furthering or promoting God's kingdom on earth. It can be done, for example, by simply striving to behave ethically and by speaking without causing harm to others or by actively defending Islam and propagating the faith. Jihād as religiously grounded warfare, sometimes referred to as """"jihād of the sword"""" (jihād al-sayf), is subsumed under the last two categories of defending Islam and propagating the faith, though these need not be accomplished only through war. When the term is used without qualifiers such as """"of the heart"""" or """"of the tongue,"""" however, it is universally understood as war on behalf of Islam (equivalent to """"jihād of the sword""""), and the merits of engaging in such jihād are described plentifully in the most-respected religious works. 18 Nevertheless, Muslim thinkers, and particularly ascetics and mystics, often differentiate between the """"greater jihād"""" (al-jihād al-akbar) and the """"lesser jihād"""" (al-jihād al-asghar), with the former representing the struggle against the self and only the """"lesser jihād"""" referring to warring in the path of God. 19 

 

Itaqallah, how was my suggested addition from Britannica Encyclopedia on the five types of jihad.  

I have no problem with """"in the way of God"""", since the sentence is phrased as giving jihad's meaning, not its literal meaning. -  

Another problem with the article is that it fails to mention the new interpretations of jihad (on the behalf of some renowned scholars) which disagree with usage of warfare except in defense.  
Too bad those guys weren't around during Muhammad's time.  
One can always fnd some quotes like the two above in a serious book on jihad. However, 99 percent of Firestone's work is about, yes, warfare.  Or

"""It depends how you define """"World."""" The war which commenced in 1939 was only between European states, while the two most industrially powerful countries on the globe (USA and Soviet Union) were not at war. It only becomes an actual world war in 1941. It could be rationally argued that if the war had ended before 1941, before the USA and SU got involved, then it would just have been called the European War, or the Great Nazi War, or the Anglo-Franco-German War or something similar. It is difficult to see why a war which leaves out the two most powerful countries on Earth could in any real sense be called a """"world"""" war. (And I am writing this as a European.) Still, the war has to be called something, and once it became a world war in 1941 then the name could retrospectively be applied to the fighting which preceded it.

Well, 4twenty42o, I certainly don't put on any show here, but if you find it amusing, please have a laugh. Certainly I don't see any fun in it whatsoever. I sure hope that NeilN would take another approach and not jump the gun as he certainly did this time. Also, yes, I am frustrated, and I most certainly have the best reason in the world for that. Mario Roering is not only lying, violating my copyright, slandering, posting defamation etc. here on Wikipedia harming Genseiryu and myself etc. but he does so with dedicated pages in my name on his own homepage and other sites on the Internet. Keeping up with Mario Roering and posting complaints and requests for removal of content on sites such as YouTube, free webhosting etc. is a full time job. Mario Roering has absolutely no just cause for doing what he does, and his involvement here at Wikipedia is no different from his exploiting every other possible way on the Internet to slander me. On the contrary. That is why I do not need anymore crap from anyone, and perhaps I do tend to sort people a little too fast, even though their actions may not have been ill intended, but perhaps the last situation illustrates quite well exactly why I tend to do that? Another good example is when both Mario Roering and I were blocked a few weeks back, Mario Roering was unblocked just an instant later, but I was not, even though we posted the exact same reasons for requesting the unblock. Ever since 2005, when all this started, Mario Roering's candy-talking, deceits and lies have won him favors here on Wikipedia from the admins and others. The last action from NeilN would in my best opinion constitute yet another one such favor. I have never ever postulated, that these favors were done or initiated on purpose, but I have, and I still do claim, that lack of interest for fairness, facts and true intentions, makes this kind of manipulation by Mario Roering possible. And it should not be possible. EVERYONE should be equal to rules and regulations, but for Mario Roering, on mcuh more than one occasion, that has indeed not been the case. Mario Roering has been able to continue his deceitful and ill intended ways on Wikipedia for almost 5 years now. When will it ever stop? As long as it is this easy for Mario Roering to manipulate everyone he wants to, I cannot see the end of it. Even though I still believe that Mario Roering was using NeilN, and that NeilN did indeed jump the gun here siding with one party, instead of issuing equal consequences for both, I will let this one go and """"reset"""" the system. But what I have written here, should be taken into account and something serious should be done about Mario Roering's methods and ways.   """,0

The Antelope Valley Press, colloquially referred to as the Valley Press or AV Press by its staff and Antelope Valley residents, is a daily newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Palmdale, California USA. It is the largest circulating newspaper in the area. The Valley Press covers the fast growing Antelope Valley - especially the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and adjacent areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including the upscale Los Angeles urban escapes of Acton and Agua Dulce. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance.

Other adjacent areas the Valley Press covers on an as-needed basis include the Victor Valley, Bakersfield and the southern San Joaquin Valley, and the Greater Los Angeles Area. This is especially true for aerospace related stories and local high school and college level sports.

History

The Valley Press was founded by A.J. Hicks on Saturday, April 3, 1915 as the Palmdale Post. At the time, the Valley was home to about 3,500 people. Over the decades of the 20th century, the newspaper changed hands, and there were a few name changes as well. On May 4, 1950, the paper became known as the South Antelope Valley Press.

On July 1, 1958, four men initiated a partnership between the Markham and Odett families. Arthur F. Folz was president of the board of directors in 1958, with Ralph and his brother Maurice W. Markham as vice presidents and Lamont Odett Sr. as secretary-treasurer. Ralph H. Markham bought out Maurice W. Markham, and Lamont Odett Sr. bought out Arthur F. Folz on April 1, 1961, to create the partnership of Ralph H. Markham and Lamont Odett Sr. In October 1975, Lamont Odett Sr. died and sons Bill and Monty Odett Jr. became co-publishers. On March 1, 1981, William C. Markham joined the Odetts in daily management of the paper and was elected corporate vice president and advertising director. William C. Markham became president of the board of directors after Ralph H. Markham's death in November 1985.

The Markham family became sole owners of the Antelope Valley Press in January 1994. William C. Markham is president and publisher. The William Odett family had father William and his son Lamont (""""Monty"""") Odett Sr. running the day to day operations of The Yuma Morning Sun (Now The Yuma Sun) with William's new wife Miriam as part of the team in the circa 1925 to 1935 period in Yuma, Arizona. When the Morning Sun changed ownership in 1935, the Odetts moved to the San Fernando Valley and later to Palmdale.

The paper later dropped the """"South"""" from its nameplate, and became simply the Antelope Valley Press by the early 1960s. It was a Thursday afternoon weekly until 1959 when a Sunday edition debuted. The Tuesday edition was added in 1969, followed by Friday (1982) and Wednesday (1988), Saturday (1992) and finally the Monday edition in 1998, making the Antelope Valley Press a full-fledged daily newspaper - perhaps the first Mojave Desert California based newspaper to commence daily publishing with morning delivery. The paper remains in family hands, and has never been corporately owned or had nonlocal ownership.
Technology and editorial outlook

The Valley Press was famed locally from the late 1950s for its peach-colored newsprint while under the Odett/Markham family ownership. The paper stopped using peach newsprint in 1975 due to expense and the increased use of color.

The newspaper moved into the digital age beginning in 1986 when City Editor Bill MacKenzie was given the assignment to find a publishing system. The result of that search was the installation of a Morris Publishing System network of personal computers for both classified and editorial requirements. That classified system was replaced in 1999 with Digital Technology Internal equipment. Editorial followed in 2002 to make the paper completely paginated in one system. The classified system was upgraded in early 2005 and the editorial system will be upgraded by year's end.

The first and third of those should probably be removed altogether - it isn't the purpose of Wikipedia to raise Grossman's profile, nor to sell his t-shirts. The second could be made more neutral by changing it to:
""""Having worked in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an sizeable body of work...""""
Also, several sections of the article (""""Painter"""", """"Sculptor"""", """"These days"""") don't cite any sources, so things like:
""""surveying four decades of Grossman creations, one finds that """"the awkward, early work"""" and the """"tired, later work"""" simply don't exist.""""

"Well there's been a lot said, if I can just address Kolzene's point first. I don't quite understand your suggestion that the article needs to be split into 3 different ones, what would these different articles be? Firstly let's just overview what is already in place, we've got this article: Technocratic movement (and the sub-articles like Technate, etc.), we've got Technocracy (which is just a disambiguation page), Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory). Then we have Network of European Technocrats, which is part of the broader Technocratic movement. So what you're saying is we need a Technocracy Incorporated article, specifically about that group, detached from the main article in the same way as NET? Well, I suppose that could be done, but remember that that article did already once exist and was then merged with this one. What would this article contain if all the Tech Inc. stuff were taken out and put in a different article? I have to say, I think further splitting of the articles will only create an even more confusing array of definitions for readers. Perhaps we should think about reformatting the above articles into a more reasonable arrangement. The article Technocracy used to be a lot bigger and gave more info on the different groups and definitions of the term, but it was recently trimmed down to something very small, (which I was against doing BTW). So to start from the beginning, we have the word Technocracy, which has acquired many different meanings, one meaning being a Bureaucratic oligarchy of Scientists, this is addressed in the Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory) articles and isn't really relevant here. The other meaning, the one we are concerned with here is that used by the Technical Alliance and Tech Inc. and subsequently adopted by several other groups in 1930's. Then NET, which was essentially a direct branching from Tech Inc., just in Europe, but has adopted it's own ideas, some of which are different to Tech Inc's. I don't really know what is the best way to proceed yet, but I don't think anything should be split or deleted without a lot more discussion.",0

 Website display 

I'm just curious, especially because I've been seeing several editors doing this, but why would you change """"Evanescence.com"""" to """"www.Evanescence.com"""" (as you did here), when the former is a perfectly valid link to their website and is much more visually pleasing? —  (t @ c) 

The infobox doc has the standard format as """"www.example.com"""" and the Official link at the bottom of the page was directed to www.ev.com so I followed that pattern as well.  Also, as you mentioned, most other pages have the www. on there as well. Most of the time the reasoning is because when visiting the domain without the """"www."""" subdomain, it redirects to it with the """"www."""" anyway.  Apparently this is not the case with the Evanescence website (as I have just verified).  I was really just looking for consistency, though.  Since the Ev pages all had """"www."""" listed, I kept it consistent by making the infobox the same.  I agree that Evanescence.com looks better.  However, all official channels such as their official twitter page (as well as Amy Lee's official twitter page), the official youtube page, and even the WindUp records website links to """"www.Evanescence.com"""". I believe that we should follow suit. ~ [ Scott M. Howard ]:[ Talk ] ~ 

Okay, that's fine. For most any modern website, the """"www"""" is almost completely redundant, and I personally loath such things, but it really makes no difference for our purposes here. The infobox doc makes no sense to me with that """"standard"""", since IIRC http:// and https:// could technically direct viewers to two different websites, so why not require that part as well? Feels like over-standardisation. —  (t @ c) 

I just figure consistency throughout Evanescence is best.  If that's how they advertise themselves, I guess that's how we should.  On the subject of """"www"""", I agree that it's completely redundant.  The only reason it exists seems to be out of habit. lol  It even sounds stupid on radio or TV when people are advertising their sites """"Go to double-you double-you double-you dot ...""""

 A refutation of User:Lord Loxley 

As soon as my ban expires, I shall revert the English people page to that which had been agreed by a consensus of editors, though I hope that someone else does so sooner. In the meantime, I shall attempt to address each of the issues raised by User:Lord Loxley's in his """"revisions"""".

In the """"related ethnic groups"""" section you have included Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, but excluded Welsh. This makes no sense, and it had been agreed by all editors that the Welsh are among the closest ethnic groups to the English, as anyone familiar with those two peoples knows. Your argument appears to be that the Welsh should not be included because they are English - as a result of the 1536 legislation that annexed Wales to the English kingdom. I can only assume that you have no idea what ethnicity actually means, and I suggest you read the article about it. In short, ethnicity has nothing whatsoever to do with legislation, and the mere annexation of Wales to England did not extinguish Welsh ethnic identity. But you don't need to take my word for it, just look at the Welsh people page. And nor, incidentally, is ethnicity dependent on race or genetics. You have accused me of being a racist, but it is you who are the racist by insisting that ethnicity is defined by race. As for Danes and Norwegians, their inclusion is arguable (though not so much the Swedes - very few of them settled in England). The agreed consensus prior to your unilateral intervention was that no Continental ethnic groups would be included, on the grounds that the inhabitants of the British Isles are much, much closer to each other in terms of culture, history, and language than any groups from mainland Europe. Again, this fact is obvious to anyone who knows them. As a Canadian, it is possible that you may have been ignorant of this. If you are not familiar with a subject, it is probably a good idea not to make edits to its page.

Further down the article you have inserted a sentence saying that the Tudors are the chief representative of the English kingdom. This is not only false, it is also completely irrelevant.

Still further down you have completely mangled the section dealing with the Norman Conquest and its effects. You have deliberately suppressed the historical fact that the English became a conquered nation, and inserted irrelevant descriptions of coats of arms. You then suddenly lurch into a (false) description of Neolithic Britain and Gaul, as if this was in any way relevant to the Norman Conquest. You then mention the Roman Empire and one of its short-lived breakaway states, jumping straight to Offa and Charlemagne, desperate to clutch at any sort of straw that will lend support, however flimsy, to your own preconceived notion that no distinction should be made between the English and the French (despite the obvious fact that these two peoples have a very different language, culture, and ethnic identity). Your mention of the consolidation of kingdoms around capitals such as Winchester and Paris is also completely irrelevant, and your suggestion that the English Channel has been the main focus of English cultural development is demonstrably wrong - the North Sea has been just as important, usually more so.

Moving further down still, you have inserted a whole new section entitled """"Royalty"""", and it is here that you expose the full extent of your total misunderstanding of (a) what the article is about, and (b) the English people. English identity is not based on coats of arms as symbols. If you want evidence of this, look at the World Cup, being played in Germany as we speak. The English fans, almost to a man, carry the flag of St. George, and only very rarely the Union Jack. They never, ever carry the royal coat of arms in any form. Being Canadian, I suspect that you have received a rather distorted view of the English through Holywood depictions and the like. The vast majority of English people would laugh in the face of the sort of mediavalist aristocratic fantasy that you are espousing. You then go on to claim that all Englishmen are actually descended from royalty! This is patent nonsense, and once again exposes your own royalist fantasies. The medieval French-speaking monarchy deliberately did not interbreed with its English-speaking subjects. Now, I'm not saying that no genetic material from earlier monarchs exists in the modern English population, but that is not the point. Statistically, every single person on earth might be descended from Julius Caesar, or anyone else you care to name who lived long enough ago. Oh, and French is most definitely not a lingua franca used among Englishmen - we don't need one, because we've already got English. Indeed, English people in general have been notoriously bad at learning foreign languages. And all that guff ab",0

The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. There's no way you can deny that, even if you believe that the label is undeserved, that the label could be pejorative in a non-encyclopedic context, or that somehow being categorized under """"homophobia"""" and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as """"homophobic organization."""" The categories """"homophobic organization"""" and """"homophobe"""" were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question. """"Homophobia"""" is not, and these false analogies may make it seem like we're out go get the AFA, but we aren't. Although Sam seems to think it's an irrelevant personal comment, it is the case, Hal, that since you got here, you've been arguing that the AFA's opinion of itself should more of a part of the article, and that criticism should not be. Miles have been spun about how much of a big deal this is, that we're gay activists, that we're creating attack articles, that the category homophobia is a pejorative attack on whatever it labels. Now, Sam, I know you'll insist on removing this part of my comment (editing/censoring others' comments is a practice that is, by the way, fairly dubious). But remember that we are supposed to discuss the issue at hand, not the character of others - I'm not attacking Hal's character. But his history of editing for the sake of the AFA is completely relevant to this discussion and a part of the issue at hand - it explains why he believes we've constructed an attack article (hardly), why the category is a pejorative attack or accusation (clearly not), and why it must be eventually removed. I agree with Hal: it could be taken as a pejorative, and what concerns me is that it is, but only (as far as I can tell) by someone who's made it clear that portraying the AFA in a positive light is very important (no matter [[WP:UNDUE|what that entails).

I understand you, but you also should understand me. You shouldn't revert my work.

I realy respect your effort and work there, and I don't revert it. I have no desire to get blocked, or to drag you into another blockade. I want to resolve all this disputes with you. As you can see I already changed Template:Politics of Yugoslavia to a neutral, non-image version. These are my proposals to you:

1) If we put in place your version of the list of Yugoslav Prime Ministers, it will remove Drago Marusic as Prime Minister in 1945, between Ivan Subasic and Tito. If you agree to left him on the list, this dispute is over. If we agree about Marusic, we can also agree about the issue """"Kingdom or DF Yugoslavia"""".

2) Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a complete different state than Serbia and Montenegro. It wasn't like Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Kingdom of Yugoslavia, or Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 2003, after the adoption of the Constitutional Charter, whole system of government was changed. Even the position of the Prime Minister was abolished, and merged with the position of the President. Those two countries realy need a separate articles. Also, their armies need a separate articles.

3) Articles President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and President of Serbia and Montenegro should remain separate. The last President of FRY was Vojislav Kostunica, from 2000 until 2003 when he was replaced by Svetozar Marovic of SCG (2003-2006). Those two offices was very different (President of FRY wasn't both head of state and head of government, like President of SCG). 

4) Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia wasn't """"Prime Minister of Serbia and Montenegro"""", but of FRY. That article should retain its current name.

5) As you can see, yesterday I changed Template:Politics of Yugoslavia to a neutral, non-image version. I hope that you agree with this version.

 Different from 

is a common gramatical error made nearly every time the word 'different' is used.  The Oxford dictionary of English Usage states (slightly paraphrased):

""""Different is always followed by to, never from or than.  The use of different from is a common grammatical error.  The increasing use of the awkward form different than is probably due to confusion with other than.  [It then goes on about the incorrect use of the adjectival form where the adverb is required].""""

The form 'different to' was drummed into me at school.  The Americans may well use the form 'different from' as a matter or routine since they always take the easy approach but as the article is about a UK invention, British English is the required version for the article.  Pointing to internet sites that claim otherwise is not going to impress, because they are clearly making the common error, but it is difficult to weed out those that are thinking in American English.

There are still many fundamental problems with the string theory and its successors (M-theory etc.). I mention just three problems which a good Theory of Everything (TOE) should solve:

1. A good TOE should be able to formulate its own principles and fundamental equations. Moreover, these principles and equations should clarify and simplify our picture of the physical world and allow some testable predictions. As far as I know, nothing like that is still available for the string theory (M-theory), in contrast to its rather long development and far-reaching claims. 

2. A good TOE should allow  calculations of all interaction constants and particle parameters from its fundamental principles. It was actually one of the original Einstein's goals - to give some purely geometrical or mathematical origin to fundamental physical constants. No variant of string theory is able to calculate these parameters from some first principles.

3. If the TOE is formulated in some space of higher dimension (11, etc.), as expected, there should be also a unique and justified principle of compactification - e.g., a principle how to project the structures from the 11-dim world to our tangible 4-dim world. In its contemporary status, (super)string theory is very fuzzy and umbiguous concerning the compactification.

 
In my opinion, the very word """"theory"""" is rather premature in connection with the (super)string theory and Einstein himself probably would not be very happy with its present form and claims.  """,0

Hi.  Do you have a source for your addition to the Georgian language page where you said that ფ is pronounced as /f/ when it corresponds to an /f/ sound in loan words from Greek and other languages?

For example, პროფესია (profession, occupation) is pronounced /p'rɔpʰɛsia/ (not /p'rɔfɛsia/).  As far as I am aware, /f/ is not a separate phoneme in Georgian; rather, it occurs only as an alternative pronunciation of ვ before unvoiced consonants.

 sockpuppets on Physician

Thank you for reverting these edits.

I don' know why, but this article attracts lots of anonymous editors who like to delete without any explanation. I have asked a sysop (User:Shii) to semiprotect the article  he did this a month ago.

About 15 kilobytes (3/7 of the then total), including 2 large subsections, kept on being deleted by an apparent User:Nq0x77. One of the subsections (Other designations) has been in the article largely unchanged for well over a year; the wording here was earlier the subject of much discussion & editing because it concerned potentially controversial matters, but this was apparently resolved. When I tried Nq0x77's page to ask why, there was'nt one! No explanation of why the deletions are wise is shown on the Talk page. I've restored the article to the version left by User:Cubs197 earlier today, and you restored a further revert. The article has (or had)reached B class status, and is rated as top-importance, so I suggest major edits may merit at least some discussion, and I couldn't do this because User:Nq0x77 doesn't seem to be available.

 User:Shii wrote to me: just blocked the sockpuppet instead.  (tock) , and I have just replied: Thank you very much but, sadly, I think the same person is at it again, this time using a new and different sockpuppet (User: Pednursing ?), who has just made the same ~15kb deletion. Would semi-protect status stop this, or at least make it harder for him/her/it?

The Gothic cavalry was only essential in finalizing the victory by hunting down the routers.
The late imperial army of Rome was actually quite adept and varied to face all the range of threats along the long imperial border. This also includes the introduction of increasingly heavy shock cavalry quite like Parthian cataphracts.

 Pretty badly written introduction. 

Namely that the writer seems more interested in writing about common law than civil law. While I am sure some degree of comparison is very useful, if not necessary, I don't think that going to great lengts to explain what common law is and then just say """"and civil law is not like this"""" is a very good way of defining civil law.

The 4th paragraph in the intro (the largest one) is the main culprit here. In fact the third sentence in it doesn't even follow on properly from the first two and should logically read pretty much the opposite of what it does. In addition it seems to be be very US-centric: while it mentions English Common Law, it then goes on to list examples of basic tenets of this which seem to be drawn directly from the US Constitution.

So I think it's pretty badly written as an introduction, but as I don't know too much about the subject I don't really want to go about editing it myself.""",0

Moving the page is not really worth while, but a recognition of the alternative name in the text seems to make sense to me.

On the subject of the proposed merge with ancient egyptian multiplication, the two techniques, while relying on the same fundemental mathematical principal, are very different in practice. These multiplication schemes are specifically about practice, not theory. The people that use/used these techniques use them empirically.

What, what?? Ooh no, I don't do FA-class – reviewers are much too awkward to deal with at that level. A-class coupled with GA are my limit. And as far as this article goes, it doesn't need improving, it needs a 100% rewrite – it has become far too sloppy and contains so much trivial stuff that the prose is terrible to read in places, events are all over the place (i.e. not very well written, chronologically speaking) and it isn't very encyclopedic any more. No wonder it was delisted and no one wants to promote it, which is a shame given that this man was a true British hero. In contrast Napoleon's page is well written, has better focus, and is clearly of a higher standard. If I were to rewrite this, I'd literally spend months starting from scratch in sandbox and simply replace the lot when done. I don't think """"leadership"""" is required, too WP:OWNish. Simply needs someone to be WP:BOLD and redo the whole page objectively, from birth to death, without all the off-side commentary that currently plagues the page. Unfortunately, I'm tied down writing an extensive article on Napoleon's entire military career, and I'm only up to 1796 after months of reading – long way to go yet.. so even if I were to consider rewriting this, it wouldn't be until sometime next year, at the earliest, once this other article has been through the process of several long-winded PR/A/GA reviews, first.

 Evidence Redux 

I'll be frank.  The blocking of  came a bit late for my taste.  However, he was found to be in violation of the 3 revert rule, and to again quote the policy which ironically Malke was threatening people with and was himself found to be in violation of:

"""" A bright line exists on edit warring, known as the three-revert rule (3RR). If an administrator has not acted already by this point, then action is very likely, especially if a report is made to the noticeboard. Policy forbids edit warring generally, and editors may be blocked if they edit war, with or without breaching 3RR. """"

I commend  for taking the actions he did.  The subsequent complaints Malke made, and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later, are a matter of record on his user talk page.  Malke has since deleted the notifications, but they are viewable in his talk page history, and make interesting reading.

After Malke's block on August 19, 2009, I decided I needed to take a step back.  For the past ten days I have busied myself with other Wikipedia subjects.  I now return to this page.  I suggest we talk a bit about what happened, and I also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month, edit by edit.  It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I'd welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   

On closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   

Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke's concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   

Malke's concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke's talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):

   
   
- *An impartial administrator just did; I don't know you from Adam, and haven't so much as looked at the contents of your edits; all that matters is that you broke WP:3RR, and received a short block for it; if you want to be unblocked, all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring, regardless of whether you think it is justified or not. :==( o ) 

'''I highly commend the admins, and urge others to support their work.

"Thank you for your kind offer Reinyday. I accept. Admittedly I am very new to Wikipedia and am learning as I go. In my opinion, this will eventually become the most comprehensive and definitive Sweetest Day article anywhere. Contrary to what many may think, I am not anti-Sweetest Day. I simply believe Americans have a right to know the real history of what they are celebrating when it comes to holidays. The Herbert Birch Kingston Story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a verisimilitude, meaning it is very similar to the truth but not the exact truth at all. In fact, the dissemination of this story by Hallmark, American Greetings, Retail Confectioners International and countless other promoters of Sweetest Day is a form of mass deception and market manipulation. It has been going on for 85 years and has resulted in billions of dollars in revenues for these companies. But at what cost? America pays the cost of Sweetest Day in credibility, a trend which must be reversed if we are ever to win the hearts and minds of the world again. 

Please allow all images to remain in the article (unless they do not comply with Wikipedia standards). More will be uploaded soon! Also, please do not add any of the verisimilitudes currently used in the promotion of Sweetest Day unless they are characterized as such. Thank you again Reinyday! Robb",0
"""

 A simple suggestion 

Instead of contextualizing paragraph two by books of """"The Bible,"""" which implies a later, Christian source, the more relevant words """"Hebrew Bible"""" or """"Tanakh"""" (or both) ought to be the terms of definition.  Otherwise, one might start to think that """"Old Testament"""" translations, based upon the Greek Septaguint, are the authorities when in fact the Masoretic text of the Tanakh is considered by Jews the obvious standard.  

The term 'Bible' does not at all imply a later Christian source. It is a widely used term for the books considered canonical by Christians, that is not to say that they have a Christian origin. It is also a misunderstanding that translations based on the Septuagint are authoritative for Christians. Nearly all English Bible translations are in fact based on the Masoretic text. Only in Eastern Orthodox streams of Christianity is the Septuagint the standard Bible. In any case, apart from a few fringe groups, Christians realize that the authority of any translation ultimately goes back to the original Hebrew (i.e. for the books of the Bible originally written in Hebrew of course).    

Failure to contextualize

The """"Construction"""" section's 7th paragraph begins """"In 1967 Israel captured Old Jerusalem (and the Temple Mount) from Jordan.""""  No other information is given about this; the impression is that Israel invaded Jordan without provocation, when in fact Israel's actions in the 1967 war were in response to a mass attack upon her by Arab countries, including Jordan, after Egypt's General Nasser and the other Arab States allied with Egypt had engaged in an act of war by closing down Israel's ability to ship through the Straits of Tiran with the express and stated purpose of annihilating Israel.  This false impression must be corrected if it is to avoid being unintentionally anti-Semitic.   

Having a bias against Israel is not the same as being anti-Semitic. Also, I think the current statement is simply concise, not going deep into the political situation because this is not the topic of the article. However, if you feel contextualizing is necessary, just go ahead. Remember Wikipedia's policy to be bold.    """,0

67.121.104.204  

I think you're confused in regards to the definition of state. I see that you live in California, United States, which furthers my assumptions. There is more to the word """"state"""" than the """"US state"""" (e.g. Texas, Missouri, etc) definition; a sovereign state is a political entity that we call Canada, or Serbia, or Cambodia. With this definition, China, Philippines and Japan are """"states"""". The terms """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" refer to concepts which may be similar, however still have their small distinctions. In order to avoid ambiguity, it's better to refer to objects such as China, Japan, Britain, Russia, the United States, France, et cetera as sovereign states, instead of the two alternative terms. A sovereign state is largely defined in modern contexts based on Westphalian sovereignty, whilst the definitions of nation and country differ depending on various contexts.I wouldn't put too much thought on what the Chinese Wikipedia says on this issue. The Chinese language, like all languages, has its limitations in that there is no one-to-one correspondence with English political vocabulary. The English words """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" are all translated as """"國"""" in Chinese, as Chinese does not make such a distinction. The Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China is called """"中華民國國防部"""" (國 = nation), the United Nations is called """"聯合國"""" (國 = nation), the United States Department of State is called """"美國國務院"""" (國 = state), the Commonwealth of Independent States is called """"獨立國家聯合體"""" (國 = state),  and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is called """"石油輸出國組織"""" (國 = country).

"Clearly you *haven't* read WP:NPA, otherwise you wouldn't have written this. It is difficult to understand why someone interested in Jeremy Sinden should instead rush across to his far less well-known brother's article and immediately feel the need to remove tags? The tags remain because the article is in severe need of a rewrite, not least because one of the main contributors has claimed to be a 'good friend' and a 'fan' of Marc Sinden from the age of 12(!), when they met on the set of the 'Hey Jude' video recording(!). Unfortunately this is the very same editor that was caught dragging along a bucket-load of socks to try and support various POV positions and outright puffery of Marc Sinden and Sinden-related articles. Amazingly enough, this editor and their socks have added Marc Sinden's name to around 130 articles on Wikipedia. 130! For someone who's less notable than my goldfish!
It's certainly true that the Jeremy Sinden article might lead one here, because of course there are no less than *three* mentions/links to Marcus' page from there - sadly there is not one single link from Marcus' back to Jeremy's, indeed his name has been expunged completely from the Marc Sinden article. It seems more than odd that you should seem so determined to enter an edit war in only your first day as an editor, instead of fixing the egregious error that would strike any true contemporary of Jeremy's immediately! May I therefore suggest you take three actions? 
1. Go read WP:NPA yet again, just in case it hasn't impinged. 
2. Add links and content to the Marc Sinden article that reflect and respect the memory of your school chum Jeremy Sinden, because in all the puffery of Marc, poor Jeremy seems to have been wholly ignored. 
3. Expand the content of the Jeremy Sinden article such that it *at least* matches the Marc Sinden article, because it is a disgrace that the puffed-up Marc Sinden article is perhaps ten times the size of the Jeremy Sinden article, when Jeremy was perhaps ten times more notable - go and put this right. 
Finally, as an observation; as a contemporary of Jeremy you would be around 60 years old - it is both surprising and disappointing that with such advanced age has not come the sense of insouciance, and the wisdom of seniors, that one might normally expect.

Evils of Atheism

It's about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine, and before you ask, I do not generalize, I think there's a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers. Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind, and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades. Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a """"Whatever gets you through the night"""" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith.

Listen, I don't believe that Greece is 98% Greek. I remember reading somewhere something about official statistics finding that 10% of the population of Greece do not hold Greek citizenship (i.e. are immigrants). Perhaps the 98% figure pertains to the remaining 90% which would be something like 88.2% of the total population. I think all this speculation qualifies as original research though. What is interesting is the question of """"what are the Roma (Gypsies/Τσιγγάνοι)?"""" According to the Greek government again, they number about 200,000 - are they included in the ethnic Greeks figure? According to official statistics again (1991 census), the Thrace minority is 0.98% of the total population at that time (about 28.8% of the total population of Thace at that time).

 Mangojuice, I am not against articles on coats of arms as such, that would be absurd. I am against using Western Sahara as a subsitute for the """"Sahrawi Republic"""". This is where the bug lies and this goes across all topics related to the Western Sahara conflict where koavf is involved (with his systematic reverts).
 Western Sahara is, again, 1) a disputed territroy and 2) under Moroccan administration. It has as such no national coat of arms (a part may be from the one of the power that administrates it). To have an article showing the coat of arms of the """"Sahrawi Republic"""" on the disputed Western Sahara territory is nothing but using wikipedia for Polisario political interests!
 The """"Sahrawi Republic"""", which is nothing but a governement in exile, has one however. It can appear on its page, I have no problem with it.
 Result: None - as far as I am aware of - is wanting to delete """"Coat of arms of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic"""". It should only not be same as """"Coat of arms of Western Sahara""""
 I don't know whether this is clear or not, otherwise happy to discuss every detail.
 The problem we are having with koavf is that he is a fervent militant of the """"Sahrawi Republic"""" and wants absolutely to have Western Sahara be a subtitute for this republic ín Wikipedia.
 And he is editwarring everyone who thinks differently, even when this costs him to be blocked on indefinite, and again and again.
 Only a strong admin can stop him. The best solution would be to ban him from editing the topic as had been suggested once already.
 Unfortunately he is unblocked every time by admins who want to show good will, although he does not care and just ignore them once they have unblocked him.

 A message from the UN regarding this """"UN"""" geoscheme 

Dear Bart

Thank you for your email.

The geographical groupings used by the United Nations Statistics Division follow the M49 Standard for Area Codes for Statistical use, details of which can be found here: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm

The designations employed and the presentation of material at this site do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories by the United Nations.

""""Regions"""" are so drawn as to obtain greater homogeneity in sizes of population, demographic circumstances and accuracy of demographic statistics (another example is Russia  it is in the continent of Asia but it belongs in the Eastern Europe """"region"""").  This nomenclature is widely used in international statistics but it is by no means universal.

I hope this is useful.

I submit that Shiromani's version is unsuitable on multiple levels, and also undoes a large amount of totally WP-appropriate work I added. Just to touch on a few major points:
Extensive amounts of the Shiromani version are WP:Originan research from ancient texts
A historical image of a Kayastha scribe has been replaced by an image of a god they claim descent from, which is far less informative as to the community itself.
Right in the lede it makes major claims like the only sect who are referred to as direct descendants of a Vedic God with only a blatant fansite, http://chitraguptvanshi.wetpaint.com as a source vice an actual academic work.
Random OR editorialising such as Also, it is but logical to consider the status of the Kayasthas when Sanskrit was the state language under the Hindu Kings.
Frequent non-WP tone, such as honorifics such as """"Lord"""" and a generally promotional slant on this caste
A massive """"family tree"""" of individuals of no clear notability

"I got your message regarding boorishness

Dear Mark,

There came a point where I believed that certain non-BSF people  were going to whittle down and mischaracterize the BSF position and could not be reasoned with.  It comes from watching atheist/Christian boards where atheist of the militant atheist variety cannot be reasoned with and are quite hostile.  

At that point, I mocked and taunted certain non-BSF people for censorship (which they were engaging in) and mocked sources/links like Farrell Till that the non-BSF side was offering.   I do realize that I was very probably breaking Wikipedia rules there.  I also recognize that asking Duncharris to prove he was sincere by actions and rebuffing what I thought was a faux friendship letter was somewhat premature.  I should have made greater attempts to see if it was sincere.  

I will tell you what I will do.  I will send duncharris and MickWest a peace offering letter.  If it works then fine.  If not, nothing lost.

This article is on the right track, it it were just reorganized.   In general, other articles start with a background of the history of the term.  In this case, when did the designation of MIA begin.  The idea was used as long ago as the American Civil War, and surely the concept was known in the Napoleonic wars as many prisoners were taken.  However, it is also likely that the designation of MIA was a product of the expected survival or capture of opposition.  In Pre-Napoleonic times most wounded soldiers died, and many would be killed rather than taken prisoner.  I am not enough of an expert on this to say when the changes took place, but it surely has something to do with MIA as a designation.

I think that the Kerry issue is not germane at all to the overall topic, although may be worthy of exploration.  Mentioning Viet-Nam and Korea are not US centric, either, as Korea was a UN sponsored war, and many countries sent soldiers.  While less widely supported, British, Australian, and Korean soldiers were also present in South Viet-Nam, as were Chinese, and Soviet soldiers in the North.  However, there were many wars that were fought by countries other than the US that bear mentioning, especially those fought by Israel.

If using hubs there is a limit imposed by the need for a collision to be detected everywhere, iirc it's officially two hubs for fast ethernet (though in practice you may get away with more due to shorter than required delays in the hubs) but hardly anyone uses hubs anymore so this is largely irrelevent in modern network design. Switches either seperate collision domains or eliminate them entirely so this isn't a problem on a switch based network. Eventually the delays would build up to the point where higher level protocols started to time out but the network would have to get huge for that to happen with most protocols.
Practically there are several other troublesome factors. One is that switches rely on storing the mac addresses of every machine on the lan to decide where to send packets. If there are too many machines for the switches to store the switches will """"fail open"""" and end up broadcasting traffic they don't know where to send to the whole network.

 Vandalizing

Due to prior research of the fighters involved in the first three bouts and common knowledge of the sport, all common sense and logic led to me believing (like I always did) that the order of the bouts on the mobile version was the correct one. As soon as I found out the mobile version and official version were different I re-edited the page to rearrange the bouts to the most logical order and changed the prior reference from the official site to the mobile.

Is it necessary to have this many pictures of NorthPark Center? Most major malls have only one picture of the mall, and NorthPark Center, being not too notable nationwide, has 5. Shrek05 14:31 26 Jun 2006

While NorthPark may not (yet) be notable nationwide, I don't see any reason not to have the pictures of the mall, for this reason:  the mall is the largest in Texas (at 2.35 million square feet) and one of the five largest in the US (according to the International Council of Shopping Centers).  Consequently, the pictures give readers of Wikipedia a view of how a quarter billion dollars was spent in its recent expansion.  With the 1.4-acre Center Park in the middle, NorthPark also becomes the only mall in the nation with a sizeable outdoor area for eating, playing or relaxing.  At one time, shortly after its opening by Raymond Nasher, the mall also held the distinction of being largest air-conditioned building in the entire world.
 

 picture rendering under Thunderbird looks all wrong 

The pictures on this page come out all wrong when viewed with Thunderbird (I'm using ver 1.5.0.4 under Windows XP).  It looks fine in Internet Explorer (v 6.0, same OS).

Leaving a note here in the hope that someone more skilled might find it and fix it.   

 Fountains 

It's been probably a year since I last visited, but one of the major interior architectural features has always been the fountain with colored lights, and another feature I can't describe well, sort of a mini-pond with a bridge. Unusual features worth mentioning very briefly. Incidentally, having looked at the existing pictures (only one of which is at all attractive or unique), I think we'd do better to find or snap a good picture of the fountains instead. (I'd have to look into whether there are any restrictions on taking pictures; I once had problems taking pictures inside a supermarket for my Spanish class (they thought I was some sort of corporate spy).

 Major Edit (3/26/2007) - Staff Email 

I contacted NorthPark Center staff asking them to release some images of the mall into GNU license, since the mall recently underwent construction and could use some new photos.  What I got in return was neither photos, nor permission, but a revised version of the Wikipedia article deemed to be factually correct by their staff.  (A full copy of the email is provided )

Most of the email has been transplanted into the article, with a few exceptions, as some parts did not meet Wikipedia's standards of notability or NPOV.

The biggest omission is the list of stores exclusive to NorthPark.  The information does not appear to be notable.

The introduction claims """"NorthPark Center is one of the top five shopping mall’s in the United States"""" but it appears to be outdated because the List of largest shopping malls in the United States would rank the mall as #7 in the US, based on Gross Leasable Area.  The infobox has been updated to match up with the International Council of Shopping Centers data, rather than the figures currently displayed on NorthPark Center's website.

 To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV:
 * Nothing """"compels"""" a just God to """"enforce"""" a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word """"perish"""" in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather """"middle voice"""", which means a better translation would be """"whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself"""". Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a """"river of fire"""". Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will.
 * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed.
 * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not.
 Hope this helps. I'll have to look another time at whether or how any of this should affect the article, as I'm obviously coming in very late to an old discussion.  17:15 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)""",0

By definition, socking would require having an account, which I don't. If you refer to my changing IP (90.56.10.158, 90.39.177.126), it is because I have a dynamic IP, as is common where I live. I'm not Theroadislong either.

Hi again   I really think the solar sail people are a bit optimistic about its use for interstellar travel.  The reason is just that as the acceleration is slow, you have to wait a long time, and travel a long way, to reach high speed.  At a uniform acceleration a, you reach velocity v after traveling a distance s according to 

 v = sqrt(2as)

in Newtonian approximation, which is applicable at the speeds we could hope to reach.  Then

 s = v2/(2a)

and for a given v, s gets very large if a is small.  But since the intensity of sunlight decreases like 1/s2 with distance from the Sun, a does not remain constant, but drops rapidly, making things very much worse.  Once you get out to well beyond the orbit of Pluto, where the Sun begins to look like a very bright star, the photon drag of the light of other stars begins to become significant, as well as the cosmic background radiation, which has an energy density comparable to that of starlight.  Finally there is the problem that at really high speeds, the light of the Sun would begin to be red shifted, so you lose power from that effect too.  Some of these problems can be solved by beaming light or microwaves out to the ship, with a huge power station (a trillion watts, say) near the Earth, and a large aperture mirror to focus the beam on the ship.  Then, as long as you can maintain the focal spot as small as the ship's sail, you could get constant acceleration.  A calculation I did years ago (which I will not try to reproduce now...) suggested to me that speeds of maybe  0.1c could conceivably be reached in this manner (which is very exciting) — but then, somehow, you have to stop.  

(For example, if I recall, if the aperture of the beaming mirror is R, the ship sail dia r, the distance from the Sun D, and the wavelength λ, then you need 

 λ/R = r/D

and acceleration 10-3g will get you to 0.03c in 30 years, at a distance D of 0.5 light years, 1018/2 cm, which makes the mirror R ~ 50 km in diameter for a sail r 100 km, with a 1 um λ.  NB the mirror needs to be optically perfect to << λ, but the sail does not.)

Of course 0.1c is a useful speed, and you might split the problem between a beamed laser sailer, with a fusion rocket to stop, but the trillion watt figure I remember was for a fairly small ship, 100 or 1000 tons if I recall, and I think a nuclear-electric ship capable of reaching even a few percent of c is going to be much larger than that for a payload of 100 or 1000 tons.  I cannot imagine a decade ship smaller than an aircraft carrier, so it sounds like a pretty tough way to go, though possibly competitive with other approaches.  

What I personally think we need to do is work the problem modestly hard from an engineering standpoint, considering all approaches, producing realistic design mission studies that give us the best trade-off solution with current technology.  Right now the trip time, for a program we could realistically sell to the combined economies of the planet, would probably last a thousand years or more.  So in ten or thirty years we should redo the study, and see how that number has changed due to technological advances.  At some point the curve of reasonable trip times will either get down to the order of the time between studies, or else it will flatten out when we hit the wall of feasible engineering.  Or maybe there will be a huge breakthrough when somebody figures out how to create a wormhole to a nearby star, or something equally revolutionary.  Anyhow, only when the trip time is getting down to the time between studies (which would depend on the rate of technology change) would it be sensible to start a serious program, with what NASA would call a """"Phase A study"""", leading to a program start, then a Preliminary Design Review, and then a Critical Design Review,... which is when you can start cutting metal. 

Solar sailing is probably a competitive way of getting around the Solar System, though I think nuclear-electric ion drives are likely to prove better.  The latter can certainly take us all over the Solar System in the time scales of the great explorations of the 15th and 16th centuries.  Then in 500 years the Solar System will be ours, and we will have a far better idea of exactly what is out there in the dark between the stars, possibly mini-solar systems like Jupiter & its moons.  If such systems are common, we might find useful places to go only 1% as far as Alpha Centauri, which would change everything.  And the human species would be safe at last from the many disasters which threaten us now.

 Heavily biased section named as Death on 18 August 1945 

The bias in the section named as Death on 18 August 1945, is very much conspicuous, very much unbecoming of Wikipedia. There is a literary effort to establish unconfirmed events in the veil of so-called """"scholarly opinion"""".  It appears the page is intentionally silent on the report of the last commission and the inquiry commission by Taiwan Government, the country in which the air crash was alleged to take place. It is another matter, but quite relevant, that Taiwan itself has denied this crash having ever taken place.  But what is most irritating is the last paragraph, where there is a emphasis on shock, disbelief at so-called death in India, which gives a lead into a suspicion that everything (even an Inquiry Commission report perhaps!) are all babies of this disbelief.  There are pictures like Renkoji temple, or newspapers reports published at that time which unsuccessfully try to uphold the the death theory, but keeping silent on the other theories, increases the suspicion of a using this page as a tool to publish own opinions rather than information.

A report by the WAG in 2003  discussed access to CIA, and the tone of the report indicates that they consider CIA to be a major destination (although they do not specifically state that). The tail end of the report mentions that the contractors' preferred option is a new trunk road toward the CIA (section 4.6.3), and that the route to the airport, both in the short and longer term proposals, be considered for adoption as a trunk road. (section 5). I don't know of further developments since this.

Also, the map's data is as of 2002, and may not be current.

It's been a while since I drove along the M4; does anyone recall if distance markers (or whatever the technical name for the signs) list distances to CIA as well as other locations?

 Gabrielle LeDoux 

I really did have more to say about Sharon Cissna.  It's probably nothing more than a series of moot points, seeing as how her campaign has gained approximately zero traction.  If she's even shown her face here in Fairbanks, I'm sure I would have heard about it, and yet I haven't.

 Just saw your post a minute ago. I haven't had any time to look at Wikipedia in a while. You're quite correct. I defer to your more extensive fund of information on AK politics. I'm not sure why Sharon wasted her filing fee. There has been zero campaign, reflected in the lack of traction. Phone messages left for her after her announcement and e-mail both went unanswered. I saw the contributions filing last week and see Vondesaar, Homer's version of Theresa Obermeyer, is in second place with less than $200 for the quarter. Actually, I'm thinking he's actually more like that bag lady from FBX who ran Senate, was it, about 20 years ago.  Sylvia something? If Alaska were Nevada, """"None of the above"""" could sweep the primaries and general elections. You live in Fairbanks? I had no idea. I thought you were a Washington State radio person or a punk rock band -). Given her name recognition, I expect she might win the primary if the party doesn't put out a mailer for Matt.   

Now, on to Gabrielle LeDoux.  Once again, big gaping holes which require addressing.  First, Kurt LeDoux ran for Kodiak's Senate seat in 1982 as a Democrat, unsuccessfully challenging the Republican incumbent, Bob Mulcahy.  Gabrielle LeDoux was herself a Democrat for many years, including originally filing as such in 2004 before switching to the Republicans at the last minute.  

 I didn't realize she had switched. I haven't paid much attention to Kodiak since Zharoff left office. I do remember that LeDoux hugely outraised Ogg, with most of her money coming from lawyers and labor from Anchorage. Can't remember if she had a general election opponent. She ran, unsuccessfully, for the house in 2000. Her mayor's win was nonpartisan, right?  

Second, she moved to Anchorage not long after leaving her House seat.  She ran against Pete Petersen in 2010.  Petersen himself could also be classified as a carpetbagger, considering that he ran in 2004 against Bob Lynn, who represents a district clear on the opposite side of Anchorage.  Contrast the Petersen-LeDoux race with the first race in the new district in 2002, when media accounts specifically pointed out the deep roots that both Tom Anderson and Owen Carey had in East Anchorage.  

 Thanks for all your input. Please feel free to change or add.  I doh't have any ownership in Sharon's page.   

 """"Carpetbagger"""" is a term that originally meant moving from a Northern state to run in the Deep South, after the Civil War, didn't it?  Moving a few miles in Anchorage would seem to be a bit of a stretch, to warrant that label.  Anderson's race of course was the one before McGuire made Tom stop wearing the wire and he was indicted at the end of his final year in the House. The only district which jogs my memory, unfortunately, was the kerfuffle over which district Valdez and maybe Whittier would be redistricted into in 2002. (Harris  scored?) Not nearly as big a to-do as Tuckerman's first massive gerrymandering attempt in 1992.   """,0

I am a USPS employee. I am not much of an author, nor am I a WP expert (so this is probably in the wrong place and horridly formatted, feel free to fix it), but there have been a lot of changes since the 'sorting mail' section was written. For one, the MLOCR's have almost been entirely phased out and their function is now done by DIOSS machines, which are similar to DBCS machines but have the ability to perform OCR function, as well as take images and spray ID tags on the back of pieces (for mail with addresses that cannot be read by the OCR software), as well as spray barcodes on the front. Also, the article seems to give no mention of DPS, which is a set of sort programs that take local mail (letters only, although the PO is evaluating machines that will do this with flats) and put it in walking (or driving) order for carriers to deliver. There are also lots of other changes, as well as machinery and equipment about which there probably isnt much public information, including the LCTS, APPS, RCS, FSM-100, and FSM-100-AI. There is also the entire PARS system, which is is quite interesting:

Should be the third largest - behind The Dept of Defense and Walmart.  I have changed that three times - I will NOT do it again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.3.50.168   

Removal of 'Monopoly' section
While I removed the 'Monopoly' section prior to reading the discussion pages I firmly stand behind its erasure. The word monopoly is not an appropriate word to describe a quasi-government enterprise.  While describing the USPS as a monopoly may be true in the strictest of terms, the context of its usage is clearly biased.  Historically, the term has been used to describe private entities whose capital power has eliminated all useful and healthy competition. Furthermore, the word is charged with political and economic implications inappropriate for an objective article. By extension of the posters logic, the police, fire, military, the ‘Fed’, PBS, NPR, and others are violators of anti-trust laws as well.  While the USPS does not receive funds from public monies, it’s also not – as far as I know – legislated to make a profit.  Making the USPS the first ‘monopoly’ in the history of capitalist economics to ignore profits and losses altogether.
Your understanding of capitalist economics is somewhat incomplete.  Please review anarcho-capitalism, in which the state is viewed as having a monopoly on social services.  

There are no sources that deny that the USPS is a monopoly and numerous sources that say it is. Of course it is. Any good or service that has no competition is by definition a monopoly. The government forbids competition in letter mail by law. Being a monopoly doesn't require that you're violating anti-trust laws. The USPS is what's called a legal monopoly. I'm going to put the section back in.  01:25, 4 Septem",0
"This article about same-sex marriage.  In the lede, the issue of same-sex marriage is said to be a human rights issue, an equality under the law issue, a political issue.  The article says marriages are legal and social institutions.  The article then goes on to explain why some favor changing the law to recognize same sex marriage, and it explains why some oppose changing the law to include same sex marriage.  
I don't see why a lawyer, a law professor, a politician, a judge, a law review article etc would not be considered an expert on the subject (if not they then who).  Also, the entire issue of being an expert was in regards to Self Published Sources only (Wikipedia states that a SPS may be used if the author is a recognized expert).  None of the citations are SPS  and if they were they are still experts.

 Prof Rachel Baskerville´s Capital Maintenance contribution 

Prof Baskerville,

You are not allowed on Wikipedia to qoute yourself. It is called Conflict of Interest. This is a Wikipedia policy.

I may quote or add comments from your excellent work to Wikipedia, but, you cannot do it yourself. 

Your contribution which is a direct quote from your SSRN publication is also not encyclopedic - as they say over here on Wikipedia.

I also disagree with what you are stating. We can discuss this matter here on this discussion page as it is normally done on Wikipedia. I appreciate that you are new on Wikipedia and that you are a well known and top of the class academic.

Herewith then the contribution from Prof Baskerville that I removed from the article:

""""This the IASB Framework  describes (as above) how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways:
Firstly, “A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity”. 
So most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance. 

Secondly, you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance e.g. is the capacity of the waterworks, waste water system etc in the local town the same as, or better, than it was last year? Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be chosen to report this. The Framework states:
“Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day”.  These are two ‘concepts of capital’. 

Thirdly, and this is confusing, a legal meaning in the UK arose as follows: English law developed the ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends. The ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ underpins the legal rules addressing

-TABpayment of dividends to shareholders;
-TABreduction of a company’s share capital or reserves;
-TABa company’s purchase of its own shares

and other aspects. From October 2008 private companies in the UK will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court"""".
So when a commercial lawyer is discussing capital maintenance they may be referring to this third concept.Baskerville, Rachel F., 100 Questions (and Answers) About IFRS (January 24, 2010). Available from SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1526846

I will still add my points of disagreement with Prof Baskervilles contribution.

 I have  read various pieces by Dr Mehdi Khaz'ali and listened to various  interviews with him, and must say that he comes over as a fantasist. He  just says things that some people badly want to hear, and that seems to  be the only thing that keeps him afloat in the media. Regarding Mr  Ahmadinejad not having served in the War, it is not true, but from a  technical point of view Mr Khaz'ali's story may contain some element of  truth. The fact is that Mr Ahmadinejad was not fighting as a regular  army soldier or officer, but was working party as a military logistic  engineer and partly as a military intelligence officer from behind  enemy's line. If my memory is not failing, during the War years he spent  some time in Kirkuk,  Iraq, amongst members of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan or Kurdistan  Democratic Party of Iraq  - both groups  were fighting alongside Iran against Saddam Hossein. The fact that after  the War he, i.e. Mr Ahmadinejad, became the Deputy to Governor-General of Maku  and Khoy  (West Azarbaijan Province has a sizeable Kurdish  population), and later Advisor to Governor-General of Kurdistan,  have direct relationship to his War-time experience in Iraqi Kurdistan.  Thus, indeed Mr Mohsen Rezai may not have been technically wrong in  saying that Mr Ahmadinejad has not been """"at the front"""" (assuming that  indeed the alleged statement is due to Mr Rezai), but to say that Mr  Ahmadinejad has lied about his War efforts, is just a false and  defamatory statement. Let us assume for a moment that Mr Ahmadinejad has  lied about his War efforts. Is it at all conceivable that a young man  from Tehran would get so early on so high up in the highest  administrative offices of Maku, Khoy and Kurdistan, from all places? As I  said earlier, Mehdi Khaz'ali is just a fantasist who seems to believe  in his own fantasies (there are some videos on YouTube  in which he says things that no one in his position could possibly  know).

Neuropsychological assessment of a practicing dentist with elevated urinary mercury. 
Fundamental and Applied Toxicology,

NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF A PRACTICING DENTIST WITH ELEVATED URINARY MERCURY. 

R. Singer. Santa Fe, 

New Mexico, USA 

Dentists are exposed to mercury from amalgam (composed of 52% mercury, 8% copper, 37% silver) used as implants for dental restoration. 

A recent study of 32% of Singapore's dentists found mercury 
dose-related neuropsychological deficits when compared with controls. 

The current subject, a dentist practicing for 14 years in the USA, was referred by his physician for neurobehavioral examination. 

The subject presented with symptoms including fatigue, GI problems, sweats, tremors, rashes, bowel dyscontrol, and heart arrhythmia. 

Tremors of the hand and eyelid affect the subject's hand stability while working. 

Results of the Neurotoxicity Screening Survey showed a profile of symptoms consistent with neurotoxicity. 
Urine sampling (24 h) over the past year found 2.1 - 99 ppb mercury, averaging 35 ppb (expected range < 2 ppb; atomic fluorescence spectrometry). 

High readings may be related with chelation therapy. 

Current IQ was at the 87% (% = percentile; 91-96% or greater estimated pre-morbidly), consistent with his presentation as an intelligent, competent dentist. 
In contrast to a relatively high IQ, appropriate neuropsychological testing revealed that the subject 
has deficits in immediate memory (16%); 
visuospatial perception (50%);
visual memory; visual figure-ground perception (50%);
verbal learning (2-5%); mental flexibility (12%);
attentional processes (19%); logical memory (p < .004);
and non-verbal recognition memory (50%). 

Neuropsychological testing helped confirm mercury toxicity affecting multiple organ systems. 
Such deficits impact the subject's ability to practice dentistry, and raises questions as to effects of mercury in other dentists, as well as possible",0

""" North Korea actually gained approximately 230 km² from China in the 1962 treaty. 

And here's a 19th century book by Chong Yagyong, titled """"Korea's Northern Border Reigion"""" (in a Korean sourcebook compilation translated by Peter Hacksoo Lee): 
A long time ago, the area north of the Tumen River was the land of the Su-shen people. It has not been under our control since the time of the Three Han. The ''southern slopes of Mount Changbaek, where both the Tumen and Yalu rivers have their headwaters, lay within our territory, but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. However, Emperor K'ang-hsi, in the final years of his reign [1662-1722], ordered Area Commander Wu-la (Wu-la ts'ung-kuan) Muk'eteng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. As a result, the border between those two rivers is clear as well. [emphasis mine]

Here's another study of the US-North Korea border in 1962, by the US Dept of State, which makes no mention of North Korea owning the entire mountain.  And another, which says that China actually made concessions to NK on the border in 1962 . 

The only sources that seem to claim that Korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest China conducting activities on its own side of the border, and of course, a few ultranationalist sites, but please, enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. 

On another rather amusing note, it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of  judging others by the content their edits, and which prefer to judge a book by it's cover and lash out emotionally.  
should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. The result of the debate was no move.  ' 
Requested move
Chonji → Tianchi – The name was unilaterally moved from Tianchi to Chonji without concensus, for POV reasons (cited in move and talk page), such as that it should be Korean (it's on the border between China and Korea). Another reason cited was that the name of the Baekdu Mountain page is Korean as well. However, a Google search shows nearly 30,000 hits for Tianchi, and and less than 1,000 each for Chonji and Cheonji. That's two orders of magnitude in difference. (the preceding was quoted by Yuje)  
Survey
Add """"* Support"""" or """"* Oppose"""" followed by a brief explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~
 Support for the most common name. Searches for """"Chonji"""" for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. Search on Google scholar shows only 2 uses of the name """"Chonji"""" for the lake. The use of Chonji as a clear common name doesn't apply because it's not common. 
 Support — per Yuje.  Naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. 
Oppose per Visviva and my previous comments. Like I said before, we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because """"Tianchi"""" is a name for many other places in China.  
As shown, Chonji is nowhere near common. Chonji barely shows up any hits, therefore isn't a viable alternative for a clear alternative name.  
Oppose Look at my reason below.  
Comment:  The proposition seems to be flawed...  Given that Tianchi is now an article on the lake in Urumqi, if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else; perhaps Tianchi (Changbaishan) or even (heh heh) Tianchi (Paektusan), but then again maybe Tianchi (Jilin)... if we must'' have a straw poll, it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is.

Thus perhaps Tianchi could be a disambiguation page, or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a Tianchi (disambiguation) page. Either one is a reasonable alterna",0

Hi there, you suggested a merger, but you did not start a discussion, I think there may be a case for this but moving acousmatic music to acousmatic would be the wrong way to approach it. Instead, I would suggest changing the title of the acousmatic article to 'acousmatic sound' so that the page can function as a sub-secion of 'acousmatic music'; which is a particular form of electroacoustic music, one which specifically uses acousmatic sound sources. The acousmatic sound article might focus more on Schaefers' and Chions' theories while the acousmatic music page could deal with the artistic practice of using sound in an acousmatic context.   """,0

Fat is never converted to Glc, not at least in humans according to the textbooks.  

Let me add few things. First, Glc enters/leaves the cell through a proces called facilitated diffusion. Which means that as soon as the Glc concentration inside the cell is somehow increased, Glc will start leaving the cell - which by the way happens in hepatocytes during glycogenolysis. Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound. The cell solves these two issues with a single solution by synthesizing glycogen from Glc - the enormous glycogen molecules can't leave the cell, and by having osmotically inert glycogen instead of Glc, the cell avoids the osmotic shock.  13:55, 30",0

"Avoiding Edit Wars 

Acroterion, I have been trying to avoid edit wars since I was unblocked last October 2008. I try to make articles more accurate, but sometimes it results in stepping on the toes of persons who have a particular point of view. I have learned the lesson from the past, not to push an issue. I have had a few prolonged discussions, but I have avoided edit wars on the main articles.

However, I would like to have your advice on a particular issue. It relates to a comment which I have just left on the talk page of 'Kepler's laws of planetary motion'. I do not intend to press the issue and I do not intend to make any more reverts. But I do feel that there is a matter here which needs to be observed.

I appreciate that phyics is not your topic, although I do know that you are scientific enough to grasp the concepts involved. I'll give you a quick summary. There are two equations involved in the Kepler problem, each with two terms on the active side. A couple of months ago, I was going to try and make major edits to this page, but I got stuck on the issue of agreeing names for the terms in the equations. You can see that discussion further up. There was general agreement about the actual equations, but no agreement on the names of the terms. So I lost interest and went elsewhere.

A few days ago, I returned to add what I considered to be very helpful information on elliptical orbits in relation to Kepler's second law. It was reverted. But it was reverted by a user who has only ever come to physics pages in my time, to revert my edits.

I will now walk away from that page because I don't want a repeat of what happened last July. Interestingly it was during an argument with this same user last July that indirectly led tome getting blocked, albeit that the final straw actually came on the Mozart page.

I intend to tidy up some more of the physics pages over the coming months. I am not asking you to do anything right now. But I would be grateful if you could monitor the situation and provide any advice because I do not believe that this guy is doing these reverts in the genuine spirit of promoting knowledge in physics.

NOT BEING NEUTRAL & CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Blackpearl14 does not understand what vandalism is, and wrongly calls anyone who contributes per the polices of wikipedia a vandal.  She is not neutral and is in complete conflict of interest.  Based on Blackpearl4's own posting comments about herself, she believes Wikipedia is her forum and that she is owner and controller of anything to do with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.  When you complain about her actions, she wrongly calls you things, like saying you are attacking her and such.  

NOTE: Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She  celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages?   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral.  Sorry if your feelings are hurt,  but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.

Since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of intere",0

The figure used on this page isn't the number of people who self-identify as """"Black"""", it's the estimated number of people with some degree of African ancestry... in Latin America in general and Venezuela in particular these are very different things - """"black"""" only applies to people who have sole or predominately African ancestry, while people of mixed ancestry generally consider themselves """"Brown"""" (""""Moreno"""") on the census (presumably this is what you are calling """"mestizo""""). If we simply used the """"Black"""" figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European/Native American ancestry. We can't use the """"Brown"""" figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the """"black""""/""""brown"""" colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is. 
The 100% issue is a red herring - """"mestizo"""" and """"African ancestry"""" are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... """"mestizo"""" in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in """"mestizo"""" are also included in """"African ancestry"""" and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect """"Afican ancestry"""" to be all of the """"Black"""" category plus part of the """"Brown"""" category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly.

He has ignored editors on the talk page that are trying to work towards an agreement. Before yesterday I would have reverted his edit at least once. But due to the warning I avoided the article page and focus my attention on the talk page. Instead of touching the talk page, I brought the issue to AN/I. What have I done wrong?   """,0

"Zoe had to go, and that is not a personal attack, but fact. Her reprehensible conduct was antithetical to free speech and undermined the very purpose of this site: the democratization of public information. 

You must understand that the concentration of power into the hands of a few administrators over an organization originally dedicated to open discourse and conversation is a bad thing. Please, tell me you understand that? 

The fact that users, much like yourself and very certainly like Zoe (she was the personification of such disgusting aggression and bullying) casually ban editors with whom they have disagreements, that they randomly delete articles (often with no debate whatsoever) because they find them distasteful, that they threaten editors who dare challenge their bellicose absurdity, is not a good thing.

The user Mongo alone has literally hundreds of documented incidents of gross power abuse and often outright vandalism himself (see the ED article on him). 

We live in an age when our Constitution is under attack on all fronts, when our phones are tapped, our mail is read, our bank accounts are sifted through, our libraries are monitored by the FBI, our civil liberties are disregarded, and freedom in the Land of the Free is driven back. 

We need as much freedom of speech as we can get, and Wikipedia is an excellent repository for the endangered right. The lack of respect for the First Amendment here truly scares meand shows ample cause for the political decay in this country.

Three comments about NPOV
The second paragraph in this article links to 5 specific and very negative reviews.  However, no positive reviews are provided.  Instead, readers are provided to the wiki entries for religious right, conservative and creationist.  Since Rotten Tomatoes was used as a primary source for ratings, could this sentence be updated to include at least one link to a positive film critic review?  As mentioned in Wikipedia:NPOV, even minority viewpoints cannot be completed ignored (and in this case, minority viewpoint should not be applied since the minority viewpoint is the thesis of the film).  
There seems to be a large discrepancy between film critic/scientific community reception of this film and popular opinion (user reviews) of this film.  Popular opinion votes on Internet websites are not considered a reliable source, but in this case, since Rotten Tomatoes was already used as a primary source for this portion of the article, could this section be updated to include a reference to popular reception to this film, with a link to the Rotten Tomatoes User Reviews? (368 reviews, 184 positive, 50% rating at the time of this edit).  Google user reviews for this film (an aggregate, largely from epinions.com) show a similar 2.6/5 or 52% positive rating. 
Why is this film being treated so much differently than Fahrenheit 9/11.  In this entry, there is no reference to film critic opinion or popular opinion of the film even though the reception was [nearly as extreme] (except positive, not negative - 85% at Rotten Tomatoes)   11:25, 5",0

European Hearing: """"Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes""""
On 8 April 2008 a European Hearing entitled """"crimes committed by totalitarian regimes"""" took place in Brussels. This was organised jointly by the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission around the two key issues of recognition of the crimes and reconciliation. 

The aim of the Hearing was to contribute to attaining a greater knowledge of these complex issues and to enable an exchange of views between independent experts, representatives of national institutes and NGOs dealing with these issues. 

Member States, Members of the European Parliament and representatives of the Council of Europe were also present.

Forced to retire from the Army following a controversial interrogation incident in Iraq in 2003, Congressman-elect West has also briefly taught high school and served as a civilian adviser in Afghanistan.  With his successful campaign in the 2010 mid-terms, after an unsuccessful bid in 2008, he will be the first African-American Republican Congressman from Florida since Josiah T. Walls in 1876.

 Spider Loc & Young Buck controversy 
Hey boss, what is the issue you have with the Spider Loc and Young Buck controversy that you keep deleting the entire paragraph after numerous users have updated and added content to it? Are you not recognizing the beef as factual? Check out Spider Loc's homepage or MySpace page or any one of a thousand websites (including MTV) that have covered the controversy. I think at the very least, there needs to be a section for this controversy considering Spider has released several diss tracks on mixtapes and has confirmed that the primary diss track """"Lean On Me"""" will be appear on his next album. I wont re-edit the page until I hear back from you, but please consider the addition as I think it adds a lot to the page. Thanks. (209.87.194.21  )

"""

 About what """"quick-failing"""" reeally is for 

efore conducting an extensive review, and after ensuring you are viewing an unvandalized version, check the article and its edit history for the following basic problems which are sometimes found in GA nominations.

 The article completely lacks reliable sources – see Wikipedia:Verifiability.Small articles that have a single main source may still be adequately referenced without the use of inline citations.  Inline citations may not be required for some articles; the criteria name the only six types of material that require inline citations.
 The topic is treated in an obviously non-neutral way – see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.Articles on controversial topics can be both neutral and stable, but this is only ensured if regular editors make scrupulous efforts to keep the article well-referenced.  Note that neutrality does not mean that all points of view are covered equally: instead no point of view should be given undue weight.
 There are cleanup banners that are obviously still valid, including , ,  or large numbers of , , or similar inline tags. (See also .)
 The article is or has been the subject of ongoing or recent, unresolved edit wars.
 The article specifically concerns a rapidly unfolding current event with a definite endpoint.
 The article contains significant close paraphrasing or copyright violations

Another thing to look for is that if the article has been nominated more than once, go back to the previous reviews and make sure suggestions from the other reviews have been addressed.

If the article has any of the above problems, it may be premature to provide a detailed review, in which case you can """"quickfail"""" the nomination in accordance with step two of the GAN guidelines, as long as you explain this clearly on the review page. They most commonly apply when the nominator is inexperienced or is not a regular editor of the article. If you """"quick-fail"""" an article according to the above criteria, leave a short note explaining the major problems and inform the nominator.

Even if an article can be """"quick-failed"""" according to the above criteria, reviewers could also: 

 Leave a short note explaining the major problems, but without officially closing the review until the editors at the article have had a few days to respond to your concerns.  You may find that they are interested in significantly improving the article.
 Provide a detailed review, as more specific information will help future editors improve the article to meet all of the Good article criteria, but close the review as """"not listed"""".
 Withdraw from the review, and let another reviewer decide how to handle it.

Emphasis added by me. So please remember to always actually/carefully read any policies/guidelines before using them (and to not ask other users for opinions, because they might be completely misguided - just always find and read them yourself), like that (source).   """,0

"Consensus regarding name

I have seen in this article there is an issue of consensus regarding the name. Let me shed some light on the same:

1) Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra sect, just like Pope is to Christanity. Since calling the Pope, Pope John Paul is allowed in Wikipedia, the name Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin should also be allowed. Here Syedna is the word used instead of Pope. Furthermore just like the Pope, Syedna is also placed before only one person in the world in Dawoodi Bohra community. Just like Pope it indicates leadership. So by not allowing to use it would amount to discrimination on the part of Wikipedia and its editors and administrators and other authorities towards a minority sect. 

2) All the verifications in Wikipedia is done on the basis of media references and in the entire media Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin is refered to as Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin.

I would like to request the editors to please do not confuse yourselves by the issues raised by people with less knowledge regarding this article and resolving the issue of name move ahead and concentrate on improving the content of the article.

 Please read and understand Wikipedia's policy regarding Verifiability 

Hello, I see that you're a new Wikipedia editor.  Please click on this link:  Wikipedia:Verifiability and read the Wikipedia policy regarding verifiability.  It may sound strange, but Wikipedia requires that all information in articles (especially biography articles of living persons) be sourced to published, reliable sources that other people can reference to verify the information in the articles.  Saying that some information you add to an article is based on 'privileged' knowledge is really not allowed on Wikipedia, because what you are saying is that you know something that nobody else could know or verify.  So, privileged information like that even if it is absolutely true cannot be put into an article, especially (again) a biographical article about a living person.  68 """,0

I have corrected some of the worst mischaractarizations (such as stating that GLDF """"enjoys a privileged status in America"""" due to being in amity with a few Prince Hall GLs (and I note they don't list which ones), but even with my edits it is still a masterpiece of puffery.

"Dear Graeme,Please loose your pressure
I dont want to pressurise you more. You have already helped me a lot.  but carefully ...... read my talk page at bottom & what I have answered to Keeper76 & Aleta.......
Dear Aleta, 
You are right. I respect you a lot for you have supported my page without knowing me. You see, Aleta ,  I am a human not god. it's question of creditability  not only mine but also of an entity – identity  in question. I provided all the facts what so ever was demanded by wikipedian editors or opposers. But without investigating /verifying my news/reviews on Sonee , the administrator ruthlessly  deleted it under influence of  4-5 people. Have they kept  two lines over there on the person in question. I would had not raised my voice. Frustration & fighting for my democratic rights are two different issue. You can put me in any slot. It’s your view and mind. However ,  This might be an inspiration from  Sonee to me or person like Gandhi where person has to fight his  battle alone. Without dying no body can enjoy heaven. I have learnt form such people –if  you  are certain to certify self  reasoning or common sense considering it  ethically right then  least care what might the world think of you. One should act and speak right. & that’s what I am doing here. Few people have label my writing as soap box, unreliable etc… God bless them. They don’t know  about the person what revolution his voice is going to influence the world in future. Jesus, Kabir  did not changed the world in a day. No wikipedia was there then to suppress such voices or sharing their info. Strangely Good or  ridiculously bad human one day are in scripted in history. May be Jesus or Bin Laden. So my suggestion to you as a well wisher is never leave your good deed, Person like Graeme & You are rare angel breed. I can feel from my inner sense of little wisdom . I may or may not raise the page on Sonee as my mood is very upset @ present, but ever if couple of you angels feel to raise Sonee page once again any of  your good selves can go contribute for the betterment of world welfare deeds.  Try it. You will get a peaceful sleep. Because real angels never sleep unless they help a true person in difficulty successfully. They don’t leave the victim in middle of ocean.  I am fed up putting my points clicking reading all wiki pages. I  have gone mad to convince them. It’s just writing on sand.  So,  If your instinct feel Sonee deserve two line after reading below talk page of Graeme & Keeper76  feel free to raise a para on Sonee. That is enough for my satisfaction.  Read the following links & forward my voice to the ‘Chief Arbitrator Section’ or chair persons directors who run this wiki show biz.

"Abuse of 'authority' 
Not to burst your petty little power trip, but it isn't exactly fair game to ban someone just because he was right and you were proven wrong. When someone accuses another of being an 'anti-semite' just because the ADL has labelled him as such, I want to point out to to the Wikipedia audience that however horrible it may be, 'anti-semitism' actually originated from the United States, not Nazi-Germany, though it later adopted it from the likes of Madison Grant and Charles Davenport. Wikipedia's own article on Henry Ford states as much, yet when I bring it up in a Talk section, I get accused by the likes of you for vandalism and banned.

It is the sheer height of hypocrisy that you can go around calling people like me a 'crank' and 'conspiracy theorist', yet I get BANNED by you just because I call you a 'deceptive little creature', which you clearly have demonstrated you are. You can CALL ME all sorts of names, yet I in return am not allowed that privilege. You are deliberately colluding with THF and Collect (two other sockpuppets on Prescott Bush's page) to get rid of as much 'inconvenient' information as possible. Perhaps it's just because you're really clueless and really don't know alot - that would be at least the half-way respectable scenario, and the least weighing on your conscience.

You want your audience (who I presume you want to delude, that is, unless you really DID NOT KNOW Henry Ford published The Elders Of Zion) to remain in a paradigm - without ever knowing where anti-semitism originated from and what a joke it is to see the ones who PROMOTED the concept of 'racial purity' and 'Aryan superiority' to Hitler to remain free of persecution. You use that 'ploy', that 'slogan', 'anti-semite', 'crank', as a silencing technique. It's a deceptive con-game, especially when you never get at the heart of the matter - where the anti-semitism came from, who started the ball rolling, and hey, guess what? The source of origin is a very unlikely one, and very unfortunate and inconvenient indeed for the self-righteous Americans always eager to trot out charges of 'anti-semitism'.

Unfortunately for you, and your sources, Prescott Bush's collusion with the Nazis is a well-established fact, and is well-documented in numerous high-profile books on the subject, including Trading With The Enemy: An Expose of the Nazi-American Money Plot. What you have constructed thus far are 'strawmen' arguments and falling back on 'guilt by association'. You peddle establishment sources as the ultimate harbinger of truth, perhaps KNOWING or NOT KNOWING the complete collusion of mainstream news with the establishment. More unfortunate for you, still, is that President Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, Margaret Sanger, the father of JFK and countless other Americans clearly believed in the Nordic/Aryan races' superiority and viewed the Nazis as good. Worse still is that FDR refused to take Jewish refugees from Nazi-Germany. Even worse, university professors were making statements in 1936 to the tune of 'Hitler is beating us at our own game - race hygiene and sterilization'. This is all documented in books such as Edwin Black's 'War Against The Weak' - and don't come with your silly, puny little slogan such as 'conspiracy theorist' just because you don't care and don't want to know.

Unlike you and your petty insults and one-liners, I can back up all these claims with facts and more. I can only conclude that you're a weak-minded yuppie who really does not CARE about the facts, but whether or not you can hang out with your equally deceptive Wikipedians, gain some 'street' credits and keep people in a deceitful paradigm while slandering people who want to break out of your make-believe reality. And of course, being an American, you want to uphold this concocted, grand noble myth that you're the good guys and you fought Nazism. I can only tell you haven't looked into the eugenics history of your own country, or the Royal Institute of Intl. Affairs Conference of 1938. You didn't read Edwin Black's War Against The Weak, haven't you? You haven't read Eugenics And Other Evils by Chesterton, huh?

We live in the information age, sonny. Ignorance is no veil to hide behind - and neither are petty and childish retorts like 'crank', 'anti-semite' or 'conspiracy theorists'. So lose that beard of yours and that smug grin (BTW, not to hurt your ego, but you don't look all that great), quit being so gullible, because I have a newsflash for you, if you keep sticking your head in the sand, you're gonna get hurt real bad too, bubba - by your own masters. The only thing you're doing is discrediting Wikipedia even further by engaging in clear deception.

And if it serves your power trip, go ahead, ban me again. Do what thou wilt. Do your worst, 'bubba'. Show me your power!!!! (ROFLMAO) Your Internet is gonna get shut down soon, bubba",0

Which made me think of Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience/Workshop‎ in which the """"science is based on evidence"""" clan does battle with the """"ideas are science too"""" clan in the field of cosmology as it related to plasma.

Excuse me but abusive is when someone repeatedly removes your contribution and ignores your request for why they are doing it.  Collaboratively means that one person not be completely ignored as my requests for further explanation were.  That is what I am calling abusive.  I provided solid references material in good faith and my small addition was constructive.  I have a feeling I am being set up here and this is absolutely unfair - almost dictatorial.

Cristina,

Am I allowed to wish you a Happy Valentine's day, or is that verboten?!

Anyway, how are things? Have you moved into the new apartment yet? If not when? I'm really looking forward to paying you a visit and seeing it for myself - and of course you and Kerim! Don't forget when you are settled to send me some pics of the place.

You asked about Connie and Elvira. They are both well thanks. Tomorrow Connie will visit her parents for a couple of weeks to celebrate the New Year. It must be amazing to be in China for their New Year - it is such a big event. I know travelling and hotels in China at this time is a nightmare, but I still think it would be an unforgettable experience. Maybe next year..  Life in Peru is good; no news though. I'll phone Elvira this afternoon and then see her on messenger this evening after German. Are you and Kerim going to do anything special today? Romantic meal with wine and candles, followed by a quiet walk under a moonlit sky?! Or will he come home late from work, drunk and with lipstick on his collar?  ;-)

Is next Monday a bank holiday for you? It is here but I'm not too sure what to do. Claire has invited me to Lake Constance, something I need to think about. Or I could spend three days studying German -(  Blöödy German. If Europe wants one common currency, then why not also one common language? (Not French - Sorry Kerim!) To be honest I don't like my German lessons. The teaching format is, for me, very unconventional. There is very little reading and writing - almost nothing. Instead we are 'supposed' to learn through talking and repeating. While I know this will be perfect for some, not everyone can learn in this way. I sure you know the three ways people learn: aural, visual and kinestic. Well I know I'm a mixture of visual and kinestic. And when it comes to learning a language I have to see it written on paper, write it several times and actually use the words. Also she, the teacher, is not supposed to talk in English. Which begs the question how can she explain something complex without explaining to us in our own language. OK, enough moaning about German!

Thankfully I am not suffering from spending yesterday evening in the gym. I am hoping that I become addicted to the place and that I *have* to go to get my 'fix'. Tomorrow I have a fitness assessment which will be interesting. Next week will be the induction and I shall be given a program to follow. They also have lots of classes which is one of the reasons I chose to join this gym. Along with the muscle/fitness classes they also have more relaxing classes: yoga, pilates, etc. which I quite like. I find listening/understanding the class instructor hard enough in English, so to do it in German will be amusing! The gym I go to is in the centre but there is one closer to my home; not too sure how to get there though. Elvira wasn't pleased when I told her the showers and saunas are mixed! You know how jealous those latinas are ;-)

OK, time for me to leave you in peace. Please give my greetings to all and you take care. I shall be in touch again soon.

Besitos,
Dave",0

 I believe in their Indoaryan Origin (or Iranians of India). 

Certainly from what ive seen, read and experienced about Roma people i think that they certainly show close resemalance to similar Nomads of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and  just North India (not south India); yet i don´t agree that the historians or anthropologist should keep on mentioning India as the origin of their people, since India is to big a concept and ethnicity to do so. We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans (indoeuropeans of iranian orign) that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture (later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan, Jammu-Kashmir, Guajarat and north-west regions basically to extend their culture)

It is precisly the regions of the """"Sindhu River"""" between mountains of Afghanistan and the Pakistnian valleys of """"Kashmir"""" and """"Punjab"""" the real home of Hinduism and """"indoaryans"""" (indoiranians).

So what i mean, is that if we talk about """"gypsy"""" people we must talk not precisaly about India but first about Pakistani or Afghan-Iranian aryan culture and tribes that entered those regions invading the aboriginal populations and established a new culture.

That is why many people feel (i am one) that """"roma"""" people have more connections to mesapotamia or semitic peoples since many forget to mention that indoarians (invading iranians) where culturally and ethnically closer to Semites, Huns and Greeks that came from Iran (a fusion between them peoples id say). 

Precisly the Romani languague closely resembles Punjabi and Hindi yet more closer even to Pothohari and mountain languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan (were there are many nomadic tribes).

That is the reason why many gypsy dont look Indian (south indian atleast) but more Persian, Iranian, Kurdish, Dardic, Drokpas or Pashtu people and dont have dravidian traits of austrolid or asian origin; but certinaly resemble a mix of southern european mediteraneas (iranian-greek) mixed with semitic traits. M

Many gyspys have long beards as how old nomadic VEDIC ARYANS (sun worshipers, budda etc) had; as well as have green eyes and a reddish tone to their skin like people for centuries where nomads in the mountain areas of Pakistan, North India and Afghanistan. What i mean to say is that they dress,look,act,and their music is more similar to people like the Kurds,Dards,Guajars,Pashtus,Pothoharis,Kashmiris and Punjabis than to dravidian-mongolian or austrolid indians.

We must also remember that the apperance of those nomadic indoeuropean (iranian) and others partly semitic-iranian-hun-greekish people; is how old ARYANS used to look like; add to that a reddish tone of skin since they lived in the mountains. 

The dress of gypsy people closely resembles more Iranin or Afghan nomadi peoples. The tipical jewlery and earings of women nomads in those areas is one sign. Also the long hair used buy man plus earings close resembles those aryan conceptos of sunworshipping worriors that where great horse riders and metalsmiths who brought Cattle_Cows to the desert and tropical areas of Pakistan and India; that was how historically dravidians described those whiter skinned, mostage-bearded men that invaded their more asian-austroloid land.

I believe Gypsys or Roma are descendants of the """"Indoaryan"""" of  orgin worriors of """"iranian origin"""" that settled in the mountanous regions of Pakistan (Pothohari-Kashmir) and those who went into the deserts of Rajasthan (Rajputs-Jatts). I believe these people gatthered together to defend themselves from invading Muslims as did classical persiands; yet where defeated and pride got to them so they fled their land since they wanted to continue their concept of nomadic sunworshippers.

Would it be possible to ask Elonka to address directly the criticisms and answer them rather than question the credibility of the critics?

 Fair use images and original article 

I don't understand this neurotic compulsion that people seem to have to scrap all of my contributions to this article.  The third paragraph that was previously removed, and which I have now reinstated, contains relevant description for this article.  Similar descriptions appear in other porn-related articles on wikipedia.  As for the pictures, the lead image is a promotional photo head shot and it is a much better representation of the subject than an amateur fan pic.  The """"Helles Belles"""" image illustrates relevant text in the article.  In fact, fair use rationales and appropriate licensing tags have been provided for both of these images.  I don't understand what the problem is since both images are regularly used for promotional purposes by the copyright holder to market Laura Angel and products related to her.  Thus, the appearance of these same images on wikipedia is altogether fair and appropriate as an accurate visual representation of the subject.  Also, both of the images I have added to this article are much more characteristic of Laura's professional appearance than the Brussels fan pic.  If someone wants to expand the article and add the fan pic somewhere alongside further text down below they are free to do so.  However, I request that people refrain from taking out perfectly legitimate and accurate contributions that have already been made to this article.""",0

 Samoa mo Samoa - Mata Usi Wikipedia 

Samoa (i/səˈmoʊ.ə/; Samoan: Sāmoa, IPA: [ˌsaːˈmoa]), officially the Independent State of Samoa (Samoan: Malo Sa'oloto Tuto'atasi o Sāmoa), formerly known as Western Samoa, is a country encompassing the western part of the Samoan Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Samoa announced their independence to Aotearoa - New Zealand in 1962. The main island of Samoa is Upolu, and is one of the largest islands in the Polynesian Triangle, next to Savai'i. The capital city, Apia, and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu.

Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976.[6] The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, has been called “Navigators Islands” by late European explorers, who at 3000 years after Polynesia's """"Age of Navigation"""" surged into an era of exploration. Before the 20th century because of the Samoans' seafaring skills, and origins of Polynesian culture,  

History Main article: History of Samoa
Many recent studies into the pre-history of Samoa has been taken up by Asia Pacific Universities, including departments in Aotearoa - New Zealand. In general public education, the Polynesian Expansion is chronologically studied in the range of 3,000 years, leading off at a Lapita site at Mulifanua during the 1970s.[8]

The origins of """"The Samoan Expansions"""" are linked to the Pre-historical waves of Southeast Asian expansions which is a continued study in modern research in various scientific disciplines such as Genetics, Linguistics and Anthropology. Scientific research resides on the results that the Samoans originate from, or of, the ancient lines of Austronesian expansions and predecessors during some of the first waves expansions eastward across Southern Asia and Asia Pacific. The Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia through Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE is an on going Anthropological interest.[9] The Samoan origins are currently being thoroughly assessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.

It's theorized that intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained in Pre-historical eras between the Polynesian Lapita colonies. Archaeological record supports Samoan oral History and Genealogy that indicate inter-island exploration, war, colonization, and eras of Monarchal ties between ancient Samoans, Tongans, Fijians, and in Eastern Polynesia orders - Ali'i.

Jacob Roggeveen (1659–1729), a Dutchman, was the first documented to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by another western explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811), who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when missionaries and traders began seeking relations with Samoan orders.

Religious missions were cautious in Samoa which began in the late 1830's by John Williams, of the London Missionary Society arriving in Sapapali'i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti.[10] According to Barbara A. West, another western author seeking interests of readers, """"The Samoans were also known to engage in “headhunting,” a practice invoked in ancient Samoan warfare, in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus taking his Mana.""""[11] By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation of being savage and warlike from a famously published French journal of the times, which insued panic during that time, and a wonder of Samoan invasion. The violent altercations had occurred between a village of Samoa and a French expedition [La Perouse Expedition], who had lost almost the entire crew leaving the expedition adrift, over a French sailor direspecting a Samoan woman.

Later expeditions by the British, German, and American forces, who by the late nineteenth century understood the invaluble oceanic position of Samoan trade, sought it's cooperation in resupply and refueling for coal-fired shipping and whaling.

"""::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was """"betrayed"""" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. 

That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy.  19:06, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

"""

 My signature and your actions ~  

I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing, but I couldn't be fucked.  So, I'm just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy.  

You stated when you blocked me, """"anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (personal attack in signature - will unblock on signature change"""" .  I disagree with your action on three levels.  The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all.  

 Why it wasn't a personal attack 
""""The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm."""" (From WP:BP).  Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is """"Disruption"""".  Under this it has 

""""A user may be blocked when his/her conduct severely disrupts the project — his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia.""""

And """"Blocks for general incivility are controversial"""".
In no way could any of my actions be considered """"severely"""" disruptive.  Or even simply disruptive.  While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first.  So, from WP:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block.  

Now we examine WP:NPA.  This is simply, """"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia"""" and I agree with it.  The point here is """"personal"""".  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone.  It was a generalised comment and an """"in joke"""" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke).  For the """"attack"""" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was """"attacked"""", you would not be able to do this.  

So, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits, thus it should not be a factor in anything.  

As to general incivility, I simply disagree.  From WP:CIVIL, """"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress"""".  My signature was not """"personally targeted behavior"""" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of """"conflict"""" or """"stress"""".  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case.

 Why I should not have been blocked 
In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:BP which states, 

""""Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users (whether individual IPs or IP ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users.""""

In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:BP.  You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely.  In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and/or detailing why you felt that the block was needed.

 What could have happened 
So, what could you have done?  Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example).  If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature.  If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing.   

 Conclusion 
As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing.  However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so.  This, by the way, is simply a statement.  

What would I like you to do?  Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of """"I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you"""".  

If you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless.  

A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster, but here would be fine as well.

The idea that one can distinguish the 'thesis' and 'theory' of intelligent design is puzzling. While I don't have access to Jones' Encyclopedia of Religion, there's an entry from 2003 (listed as 'forthcoming') on Dembski's list of writings on ID. Note that this is pre-Kitzmiller, and is typical of Dembski's writings of the time - Sagan, Paley and Kant. Assuming that this is substantially similar to the final version, there's nothing about thesis vs. theory.
Beyond this, John Carter appears to misunderstand the idea of """"theory"""". There are I think perhaps several other areas of what might be called """"theoretical biology,"""" such as parts of astrobiology, which also have a total lack of any hard evidence to indicate that they even have something real to study, in that case alien life. No. That's not what theoretical biology is. Take a look at the TOC of the Journal of Theoretical Biology. Or try Acta Biotheoretica. Or even check out the journal Astrobiology. Theory isn't about """"things that lack total evidence"""". 
This entire section about 'thesis' vs. 'theory' of intelligent design appears to be based on both a misunderstanding of what Dembski was saying (pre-Kitzmiller, when he was predicting the overthrow of """"materialistic"""" science and a department of ID at a major university within a decade) and a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference of what constitutes theoretical biology, and how it differs from unfounded speculation and science fiction.

First off let's be clear, this is a proposed merger not a deletion. Looking at your argument of other stuff exists, the only HD specific example that you have mentioned (List of DirecTV local channels with HD) compares the availability of affiliated HD channels between cities, not a million miles away from this page comparing channel availability between platforms. The other examples that you have given are lists per platform, as you said. The fact is HD channels on Sky do form a part of Sky Digital and not another platform called Sky+ HD, HD channels are clearly labelled on List of channels on Sky Digital as being in HD were applicable. There is absolutely no distinction in the amount of HD content shown, if it simulcasts with an SD channel etc. on the same channel between platforms. There is no need for a list of channels in a certain broadcast format on a certain platform and it seems like content forking and listcruft. You also mentioned size, labelling this page as potentially """"unwieldy"""", there are clear guidelines for the size of articles and compared to the other lists that you mentioned, this page could double in size without problems. If you want to talk long term, then in the future it's likely that being in HD or knowing if a channel uses up-scaling won't be especially notable just as being in 16:9 or using widescreen switching or stretching/zooming isn't today and at some point this page could also end up being merged or otherwise. By the way, there is a List of television stations in the United Kingdom (foreign versions may be found at Lists of television channels) and I agree that it is somewhat impractical for certain tasks. As for Andrewcrawford's actions, Help:Merging explains that """"If you think merging something improves the encyclopaedia, you can be bold and perform the merger, as described below. Because of this, it makes little sense to object to a merger purely on procedural grounds, e.g. """"you cannot do that without discussion"""" is not a good argument. If the merger is controversial, however, you may find your merger reverted, and as with all other edits, edit wars should be avoided. If you are uncertain of the merger's appropriateness, or believe it might be controversial, or your merger ends up reverted, you can propose it on either or both of the affected pages."""" A proposal had been made in August 2008. """"If there is clear agreement with the proposal by consensus, or if there is silence, proceed with the merger."""" There was silence so he did nothing wrong. With regards to DarkLight748, he did not post any kind of edit summary with his edit, since Andrew does not a appear to be a regular contributor to List of HD channels on Sky+ HD he could have perceived that as vandalism and vice versa. -   """,0

I continue to disagree. Other articles demonstrate that it is entirely possible to have readable, easy-to-use tables with sufficient numbers of columns to display results for all the parties under discussion. They also show techniques to deal with parties sometimes being reported and sometimes not, and sometimes being reported together. There is no need for the opinion polling table to be so abbreviated. Thus, we should reflect what the citations say. If polls are released that lump everyone other than the four biggest parties as """"other"""", that's fine  we report """"other"""". If polls are released that give results for the Greens, BNP etc., then we should report those.

 Post 2001 bikes 

It's unclear whether the gentlemen's agreement is still in effect. I'm also unsure if MV Agusta, Aprilia, or BMW ever considered themselves bound by it. I've added some of the restricted 186 mph (nominal) bikes, but more need to be added. I've put in the BMW S1000RR as the new record holder, based on a test at Bonneville and a number of vague claims that it went significantly over 186 mph. I'd like to see better sources on that.

I'm not totally sure what to make of the results from MCN:
 http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/News/newsresults/New-bikes/2010/September/sep0110-standard-bmw-s1000rr-reaches-197mph/_/R-EPI-126474
 http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/News/newsresults/First-rides-tests/2010/September/sep2410-near-standard-s1000rr-hits-202mph/
The numbers they give for various bikes don't state in a straightfoward way whether they tested a restricted bike, a derestricted bike, or if the bike was never restricted in the first place.

Ultimate Motorcycling is taking dictation from BMW's Gary Orr, owner of a dealership, that the bike reached 196 totally stock. Other sources seem to kind of support this, but I'd be happier if it was more independent. Is the top speed on the S1000RR governed or isn't it? What about other bikes?

If I change the text to say """"The 2008 BMW S1000RR has exceeded the 186 mph limit, but there has been no commentary as to what this means with respect to the gentlemen't agreement."""" is that synthesis or original research? 

I'd like to take a conservative approach and not accept a single claim that a bike reached a record speed, and settle on a minimum speed that multiple sources agree on. But I'm not sure what criteria to use. The alternative is to throw all claims in there and let the reader sort it out.   """,0

They do indeed. My spritzing solution is 1/4 apple cider vinegar to 3/4 apple juice. If I would have had it on hand, I would prefer using frozen apple juice concentrate to make the glaze but I had 15 quarts of juice here and didn't want to go to the store. No big deal to do the reduction, I just left the lid on a large pot with one and a half quarts of apple juice for the first hour with a low setting (3 on my stove) to get the heat up and then removed the lid to let the water vapor out. I have it steaming but not bubbling...I didn't want to drive off the flavors. The house smells *wonderful*. Apple jelly can also be used as a basis for a good glaze, too.

"""I had nearly moved on when I felt completely compelled to comment on this statement """"probably better than most clan websites, which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the 19th century. Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. Especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles"""". I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being """"bastardized"""" as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate """"sourced"""" information. There is substantial """"factually accurate"""" sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an """"opposing view"""". There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were """"out-documented"""" by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.

I seem to recall RJ saying it was his intention to release the last book as a single book even if needed a new form of book binding to be invented or sold on library carts. If I recall correct, then I can’t help but feel this is NOT at all what he intended to happen.

I can wait for it be bound into a single handcover book. In fact, if that simple intent can’t be honoured, I have to wonder about the story line itself.

If it is not about profits release all three volumes at once, don’t wait for the money that will be generated from three separate hard cover and paperback releases for each volume.

Consider this Harriet has no control over this book other then an editorial opinion if TOR books decides to replace something they can and will. More then likely there was a large advance granted to mr jordan upon the start of the book and unless the book is finished Harriet more then likely would have had to return that money due tyo the book being unfinished. Sorry folks but medical bills aren’t cheap and when some Corporation has you under contract you have no choice but to at least pretend you have some sort of control. Face it this is a business and the world is in a recession what is the garunteed way to bring in SOME MONEY?

 Is Brian really an atheist? 

In the recently aired episode, """"April in Quahog"""", Brian can be clearly observed praying some time after the news report leads the public to believe that a black hole is going to swallow the earth. Also, at the end of the episode, Brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen. Based on the context of the situation and Stewie's remark in the background that the 'someone' Brian made a deal with was God, this calls Brian's atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs (though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along). There are only two other explanations for this series of events that I can think of: One would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of 'there are no atheists in foxholes', though this is unlikely because Brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear wouldn't do, let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike McFarlane. The other would be that McFarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples' work righteous attitude towards religion, however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke, an in depth understanding of what Christianity actually teaches would be required which most people (including McFarlane) likely do not posses.

"""==Kolyma==
I came across the Kolyma article while checking out some facts presented in a Danish newspaper article and was surprised to see that it had been marked as lacking neutrality in view of assertations made about the Kolyma Gulag (without reliable references, etc.). As I believe it is extremely important to ensure that the story of the Gulag is presented properly, I have spent a few hours on this article. The main problem seems to be that the author is not too familiar with Wiki editing. So I have begun to straighten a few things out - in particular correct internal links to the authors cited, additional links to the outside world and some footnoting. It would be great if some of the experts on Russia and Russian (Soviet) history could chip in too.
There has been a suggestion that the geographical page on Kolyma should be separated from the article on the Gulag. Sooner or later, I think we should do that but the immediate problem is one of establishing the authenticity of the current write-up.
I found it interesting that of all the Kolyma articles in other languages - and there are currently 16 (see http://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolima) - only two (French and Catalan) describe the Gulag. Poland has a special page on this.
I look forward to hearing from interested parties.
 Thank you for your effort in cleaning this up. I had several concerns about how these historical topics are reflected in the Wikipedia, in particular:
 Gross inflation of casualty numbers (I think the current version is more or less ok for that)
 Use of strong emotional terms to describe an encyclopedic subject, which is completely unacceptable in my opinion. List the numbers, the facts and let the reader do the math. There is a little bit of that left in the current version, but it's probably ok now, too.
 Biased representation of the camps as working only to destroy as many people as possible, and comparison to Nazi death camps. The goal of the Soviet system was to industrialize the country in 10 years (something that the Western countries covered in two centuries before that), and to prepare for the inevitable large-scale war against countless aggressors  Germany, the US, Japan, etc, each of whom has invaded Russia just two decades prior to that. To that end, the most important purpose of the camps was to build the industry that has later launched the man in space and up to this day is in the heart of modern Russia, and to manage to do so in complete isolation and with very few available resources, before getting attacked. The brutality of the methods is very regrettable, but should be mentioned in an objective article along with the actual productive goals of the program, and the benefits the country has reaped, although at a very, very high price.
 Drawing most of the information from Solzh's Gulag and dissidents' accounts, who most certainly should not monopolize the license for eternal truth. As I mentioned in the page's discussion, eyewitness accounts are important, but not the only one and by far not the most objective source of info. If you record testimony of 227 inmates of Abu Ghraib or Guantánamo Bay, they will say that those places are hell on Earth, the most mercilessly terrorized, particularly sadistic and the most unimaginably cruel human-run organizations, and the whole US concentration camp system is """"evil"""", as, they would probably claim, are the US themselves. This alone would not make a good article on Guantánamo Bay. 
 Furthermore, Solzh's book was used as an ideological weapon against the 70's and later Soviet Union to present even the second part of the 20th century in Russia as one endless deadly torture and gulag, which is, of course, a complete nonsense.
Given that hysterical overestimation and bias are very common in the West when it comes to these topics, I long ago gave up on trying to thoroughly improve related pages, because every time it sparks an endless flame war with people who tell me about tens and hundreds of millions of fictional casualties, and then my edits get erased or lost in the never-ending stream of b.s. So now I only do minor corrections, and appreciate when people try to constructively research the topic. If the arguments I presented here would help you in your further editing, then good; if not, then Wikipedia will remain a place of hysterical hatred for anything Soviet, especially in comparison to much more mellow and well-researched Britannica and Encarta.  
I appreciate these comments and will certainly bear them in mind for future editing.

 What Makes a Person Notable?

To be fair, if Mr. Parkerson believes himself or if some one who knows him believes him to be a person who has notoriety because of his connection in Longview, I am willing to let the reader decide.

However, since Mr. Parkerson has lived and worked in Lake Charles, Louisiana since before he graduated from high school; and since he has not done anything significant or notable in his life that has been connected to his early years in Longview; and, since he is not recognized or known by any but a very few people in Longview, it is therefore fair to question his listing as a notable person from Longview.  Unlike others """"Notable People"""" listed in the Longview Texas article, very few references can be found regarding Mr. Parkerson's Longview roots.  (this contributor found only one on the Internet after extensive search). In fact, it is Lake Charles that is referenced as Mr. Parkerson's home. By comparison, in the other's listings their place of birth as Longview Texas is mentioned in almost every reference of their name. 

Mr. Parkerson was born in Longview.  He lived in White Oak (not Longview) until he was 12, (according to records found on the internet).  He moved to Nacogdoches, Texas and at some time moved again to Lake Charles, Louisiana where he graduated from high school.  Since then there is little if any record of his interaction with """"his home town.""""  As I said before, he needs to be satisfied to be a notable person from Lake Charles and Louisiana.

Therefore, if he is to be listed, and because he is not well known, some background needs to be given so that the reader will have a better understanding of Mr. Parkerson's connection to Longview. A short bio and the circumstances which led to his resignation and all should be made available to those who read his name in the list.  Otherwise he should be satisfied with his legacy in Louisiana, for he has none of note here.   """,0

 Pullback of Sections vs. Pullback of Bundles 

Actually, there is a subtle point that this article gets wrong, and in fact many books get wrong (or fail to emphasize, although I believe it's because everyone learns it this way). Yes, I know that if it is wrong, I could just update it myself; but it looks like this will require a bit of rearrangement which I'm not quite in the mood to sort out now, and so it is best for me to give a brief statement of the issue here. It's also way past my bedtime, so, if anyone wants to help out while I'm sleeping, be my guest.

The problem is a terminological confusion which arises from using the term pullback for different (but related) things. For f  M → N a smooth map, there is usually not a smooth bundle map from T*N to T*M (unless f is a diffeomorphism). There is a pointwise map of individual cotangent spaces f*p  Tf(p) N → Tp M for every p, defined by operation with the pushforward of a vector in the corresponding tangent space (it is the transpose of the pushfoward on individual tangent spaces). But for the general point q in N we can't pull back to M unless we have a way of choosing a point in f-1(q) (which is especially problematic if f is not onto...). However, we can pull back sections of the cotangent bundle (i.e. covector field, and this applies in general to covariant tensor fields). The """"pullback"""" everyone talks about is a map from covector fields on N to covector fields on M, that is, given ω: N → T*N a section, we define f*ω  M → T*M  by

where f*p is just the pointwise pullback defined before. This is always well-defined. Note that this is just the opposite of the problem with vectors and their fields (and in general, contravariant tensor fields): in that case, there is a pushforward which is a smooth bundle map of the tangent bundles, but in general vector field does not push forward unless the map is a diffeomorphism. It has been remarked in several books that the co-objects seem to have this wonderful extra structure, of being able to pull back sections. What really happened is that it gave up the capability to induce a smooth bundle map of the bundles in the process, thus restoring one aspect of """"duality"""" that seems to have been broken when dealing with this subject.""",0

I usually read all of a discussion and think about it, before replying to any of it.

We have yet to have any sources that show that Brian Harvey is an expert, or what fields he is an expert in.  It's rare for an instructor at a University to be tenured, and also rare for senior faculty to let them make policy decisions alone, without tenured senior faculty's input and approval.  Instructors are usually hired to implement policy set by senior faculty, and kept on if they do the specified job well. This frees up faculty for other tasks and projects.  But this is mute - see the next point. (But if you feel you have to, in Brian Harvey's case, sources please to show otherwise.)   

Brian Harvey is not what Wikipedia refers to as an Independent Source (aka third party source).  He has used Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SCIP) at Berkeley and has been acknowledged by Abelson and Sussman in the Second Edition of SCIP. (He is not acknowledged in the First edition. (Took me a little while to find a hardcopy.)) So using him as a reference is a small step from using Hal Abelson, the subject of this biography. Wikipedia asks that non-Independent Sources be used with care and only when an Independent Source can not be found. 
 
The Boston Globe reference has the same issue in their feature, and should not be used as we have an Independent Source.   

Chris Haynes and Dan Friedman are acknowledged in the Second Edition of SCIP.  Mitch Wand is acknowledged in the First Edition of SCIP.  So their book has the non-Independent Source problem.   

Which leaves us one source that  found. I'm not going to try and find out if it's an Independent Source, i.e. who was in the group that decided on giving Abelson the award.   

Without a reference, this sentence with the word """"worldwide"""" in it fails WP:NPOV. It is also unclear what it means: how many CS departments?, what parts of the world?, etc. Even with a reference, the claim should be in a quote from that reference, not in plain text. Wikipedia prose is suppose to be written in a neutral tone, with non-neutral text clearly tied to a source. WP:NPOV also requires that available WP:SOURCES (if any) that balance out the article on this and other parts of the text be added. If you know of one on this point or others, please add it to this biography.   

A claim this wide could have other Independent Sources making it.  If any one wants to find and add them ...   

The laundry list of course materials is trivia that isn't needed in a biography, and is distracting to the reader.   

So ....   

Proposed consensus

I propose we change the sentence to this:

The Association for Computing Machinery notes this course """"was widely emulated and adopted by colleges around the world.""""

and add this as a new paragraph, perhaps in a new section Awards:In 2011, Abelson received the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award.  The citation read """"For his contribution to computing education, through his innovative advances in curricula designed for students pursuing different kinds of computing expertise, and for his leadership in the movement for open educational resources.''

If this award was published in an ACM journal, it be better to use the  template.

The Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award has neither an article nor a template. It's in over a dozen articles so far. Create either if you feel it's meets WP:N.

Not suprising. While I can easily tell the difference between French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc., put me in a room with a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldn't tell the difference.

Someone suggested: """"Heath Robinson"""" and """"Rube Goldberg"""" as a vocabulary difference.  It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here.  They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.  At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, """"Rube Goldberg"""" is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.

As an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash.

I think Americans certainly understand the use of """"bum"""" for """"butt"""", """"rubbish"""" for """"trash"""", and (to a lesser degree) """"flat"""" for """"apartment"""".  But we don't use those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say """"that's a trash can""""; a Brit will say """"that's a rubbish bin"""".  Americans are more likely to use """"rubbish"""" in the sense of """"bullshit"""". LDC

I deleted the following pair: """"limited (Ltd)"""" and """"incorporated"""", since they actually mean different things. """"Incorporated"""" means a corporation; """"limited"""" means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations).

I would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.

Yes, I'd call it a """"torch"""", and it would probably be labeled as a """"flashlight"""" in its manufacturer's packaging. IMO, 'torch' is colloquial British English  The Anome

Request For Mediation In Removing Mclellan and The Marine Corps From Manookian's Page [Armenian Issues]
I have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on Arman Manookian to no avail. As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10",0

My concern about your username (ItsTAROTCAKEbitches)

Hello, , and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?Your username contains the insulting term 'bitches' which may offend other users.

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 If you decide to just go ahead and change your username, it is possible for you to keep your present contributions history under the new username: simply request a new name here following the guidelines on that page, rather than creating a whole new account.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at WP:RFC/NAME. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you again!    """,0

This is an oooold subject/section here, but I agree, the highly detailed diagram is quite scary-looking to a novice reader, and much more complicated than the basics of the topic. Start with something simpler, since there are certainly simpler aspects of diffraction than multislit-with-vectors. File:Wave Diffraction 4Lambda Slit.png would certainly be an improvement (simpler case, still a pretty picture that clearly illustrates some key ideas). I think that diagram would be even better if the barrier/slit were actually visible clearly rather than just another thin black line in a parallel field of black lines: consider either File:Difraction.png or File:Difrakce sterbina bodova.png. Somewhat related, seems like there is no navbox for the wave-phenomena articles. Having a directory of the reflection, refraction, diffraction, interferences, etc. main articles would be a great way to tie together all these pages and help students work through/among them.   20:14",0

However, the core code in XP is based on the former and not the latter (hence XP has an internal version number of 5.1, while Windows 2000 has one of 5.0 - among numerous other things). A list of every single feature included in Windows ME (the last of the MS-DOS based versions) but not in XP would be quite long indeed, and also quite pointless, because it would be comparing operating systems of two very different architectures. (There's also the fact that comparisons between the other """"List of features removed in Windows"""" articles and this one would actually be made far more difficult.)   """,0

 Sanskrit vs Devanagari 

Hi there,

with regard to your edits, I agree with the edit on a technical level. However, there is an issue with that, in that we put the language instead of the script due to the fact that it helps identify the etymology of the word, which the script does not do. Also, there is a translation after the script, which means that using the language name would be better. Additionally, which Devanagari script is well known, what about names derived from languages like Punjabi or Malayalam. I hope you understand the point of view. Cheers. T/@edits """,0

 Fullmetal Particle Man 

Another Youtube video (located here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahNYobJ_gjQ ) that I noticed that ALSO happens to fit extremely well features Fullmetal Alchemist characters in the positions of the four men;

Edward Elric (aka Ed, aka the Fullmetal Alchemist) is cast as Particle Man, this being the most obvious joke/reference; he's extremely touchy about his height, him being almost/most likely the shortest man in the military and NEARLY the shortest main character  I think that his brother Alphonse's real body takes that distinguishment away, however). In his sequence of the Youtube video, the lines are accompanied by rather apt sequences from the anime (among them, the line """"When he's underwater does he get wet, | Or does the water get him instead?"""" is accompanied by a clip of Ed sinking to the bottom of a body of water because of his prosthetic limbs  which happen to be made entirely of metal, hence his title the 'Fullmetal' Alchemist).

Colonel Roy Mustang (aka the Flame Alchemist) is cast as Triangle Man. Promoted at one point to Brigadier General and later became Fuhrer (sp?), he is constantly taking jabs at Edward (for a rather popular example, he more than occasionally jokes about Ed's height), though in one episode in the anime and a sidestory in the manga the two actually hold a battle on the parade grounds (with the Fuhrer's permission)  Mustang wins by a comeback landslide in the manga, but in the anime the then-Colonel hesitates (possibly due to post-traumatic stress disorder, as surmised due to a flashback being shown at that moment in the anime of a young man he had to kill in the Ishbal War) and thus loses to Ed; it is from the anime episode that the video actually gets the majority of its Particle Man VS Triangle Man footage.

Major Alex Louis Armstrong () is cast as Universe Man; all State Alchemists (such as, as noted before, Armstrong and Edward) carry watches, and in both manga and anime the man proudly brandishes his watch (supplying one shot used in the video if I recall), plus he is, despite his sheer size (he is easily tied with the husband of Izumi Curtis (sp?) as the tallest supporting character in the series) and power (he performs his particular brand of alchemy through the use of powerful punches  one scene in the anime has him pick up a slab of concrete with one hand, toss it in the air, and punch it, thus turning it into a massive bullet propelled at high speed via the punch's force). In the video, his power and compassion are both seen . . . along with his penchant for posing (most likely a trait passed down the Armstrong family line for generations  a lot of his many talents, from his alchemy to his skill at portraiture, seem to be this way).

Second Lieutenant Jean Havoc is cast as Person Man, and aptly so; out of all his co-workers, he seems to suffer the most problems, particularly in his love life  Mustang has effectively stolen every single girl he's dated in either series, anime or manga, with one exception (manga-only) being the homunculus Lust (going under the alias Solaris; admittedly, it was a poor choice, as she later was proved to have been using him and ended up wounding him in his leg to the point that he could not be of any use in the military, hence his subsequent resignation, plus the Flame Alchemist did in fact kill Lust during the same incident where she crippled Havoc). Hence, the line """"Triangle Man hates Person Man"""" is given even more meaning with this Youtube video. (Ironically, when the line """"Lives his life in a garbage can"""" comes up, it shows Roy Mustang's old residence back when he was obsessed with, if I remember correctly, human transmutation.)

If you had also bothered to read the next page (p. 164 I believe) Irving demonstrates perfectly clearly what Milch felt about production levels.

 First.Regarding the above very respectable commentary by the also very respectable editor , I feel I must affix this preliminary response, as for the upcoming weeks I won't be able to build a properly documented reply. You say that I  'unilaterally and without a source named Guevara as an official """"executioner"""".'  Not true, I did supply a reference  from a reliable source (Behind Che Guevara’s mask, the cold executioner Times Online (from The Sunday Times) September 16, 2007) that I later displaced downward. Yes, I am clearly not interested in the consensus of blatant leftist editors who regard Ernesto """"Che"""" Guevara as their personal hero, or idol, or totem, who believe he should be thought of as an exemplary human being. If user Nubiatech feels offended by the word 'bullshit', I may also feel offended when he/she childishly calls 'POV' my qualification of mass executioner, which by the way is an historical fact, as many sources prove, and which should be familiar terrain to . With all due respect, when he states that """"...none of the scholarly journals, or major biographies refer to Guevara primarily in such a manner"""", one wonders if he has gone through the immense mass of documentation available, for example, from Cuban exiles? The qualification to use should be mass murderer, which Guevara was, instead of the milder executioner. To display respect or deference toward an overt criminal is not only unjustifiable, it is plain hypocrisy.

 Second, the WP:NPOV guideline states:
 """"Balance
 Neutrality weights viewpoints in proportion to their prominence. However, when reputable sources contradict one another and are relatively equal in prominence, the core of the neutral point of view policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner."""", etc. 

 Let's briefly examine what the lead section states about """"El Che"""", to see if all viewoints are represented:
  he was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary,  (sounds respectable enough, perhaps chic, even classy)
 (he was a) politician,                       (respectable enough)
 (he was an) author,                          (sounds very respectable)
 (he was a) physician,                        (very respectable indeed)
 (he was a) military theorist,                (respectable enough)
 (he was a) guerrilla leader.                 (respectable for some)
 It should be obvious that there is no balance at all in the above qualifications; they all depict a character that ought to attract admiration, to say the least, hiding the """"insignificant"""" fact that he was a three-hundred-fold manslayer, even calling POV a reference to it. This is the logical consequence of the diligence with which leftist editors quickly delete anything that might mar their hero's image, and even cry foul (like  above) when anyone doesn't abide by their rules. This user even writes """"POV (not a fact) mentioned with due weight elsewhere on the article"""" in his reverting edit summary. Question: if it already is mentioned elsewhere, why there it's not considered 'POV', while within the lead section it is? The marrow of the discussion is that we are not talking of viewpoints here, we are talking about facts.  
 
 Third. I've been following the WP:Ignore all rules rule, mentioned by  in a prominent location in his user page, toward the objective of having Wikipedia tell the truth, which doesn't appear to be among the most important ones in this Encyclopedia (if it is, I'd appreciate anyone's help to tell me about it).

"Equal Treatment for Transnistria 

We all agree that the Transnistria page is a difficult one to edit because there are strong views on both sides. The current page is a work of twisted words and opinions and is not acceptable to any fairminded person. . I have a proposal to normalise things here. Forgive me but it is a Moldovan solution.  Take a look at the Moldova main space and you will see an interesting list of headings for the topics in keeping with the way most otherr states are dealt with. Then, take a look at the headings for the Transnistrian page and you'll see a marked difference. I suggest that the editors work under an agreement of equality and respect. Under this agreement headings are by dual agreement using Moldova as a template. For example, the Intro appears on both pages and should stay, as should ; Names, Geography, History, Politics, International relations, Economics, Human rights, Demograpghics, Economy , Information technology, Culture, Gallery, External links.  Headings that are parachuted onto the Transnistrian page that are under dispute be removed, This includes all the Smuggling, Crime, and Travel Warnings. That is assuming the Moldova page would prefer not to have such heading on that page. Under this each side is treated with equal rights. Attacks on the pages cease and a degree of harmony may prevail. Can I have your feedback please.",0

 My Statement 

Oh wow, I take a little drive and come back to a nuclear war zone? I guess I can take on each point...

 The fact that MF was not blocked for the same behavior is rather odd (also... if you ask a question after telling me to stop replying... what do you really expect?).
 I agree that Tan needed to be blocked and I agree with the desysopping. 
 To say that I have no right to be angry is a foolhardy notion. I was told multiple times to fuck off (btw, when told to fuck off, I am considerably less likely to comply).
 . They both hail from the infamous Tiscali network. That being said, rpeh has no reason to be involved in this discussion (he has a personal issue with me ever since he was desysopped on another wiki; he hasn't gotten over it). I intend to request a checkuser and request a block for sockpuppetry.
 User:Georgewilliamherbert places too much weight on unofficial warnings. A vandal can be warned four times but a user once? Hmmmm...
 Prodego has no reason to be desysopped. He had every right to block for a violation of WP:NPA tens of times.

Developing your user page - it is easy
Wikipedia is a megalopolis and like in any city, interactions are very important. I recommend that you develop your user page so that people who visit your page may know your interests and share in them. It could be a single line telling others of not only your name but what you like or a complex page with every single thing that interests you on it. This is a great way of building up work groups that facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge on articles, talks etc. Happy building!!!     talk 

Become a great editor through diligence
Being a member of  the welcoming committee on Wikipedia I encourage you to help Wikipedia in any way you can to 
increase human knowledge. If you have credible information about a topic with verifiable references please feel free to add to that topic. If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 9000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users 
[] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia 
experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.    talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.     talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.    talk """,0

Mish Mash
I believe this  article in its current format is a major mish mash because by a curious mix of disparate citations  it  seeks to cover Khatris from the Peshawar to Nadia  in  Bengal and  deep south into peninsular India . 
So either the article is restructured to cover by provinces ( Both India and Pakistan)
or by creation of separate articles for Khatris from different states . Although the overwhelming majority of Khatris are Punjabi , this article in its current state has juxtaposed  citations and content from books pertaining  to one region to attach to another , which is really quite absurd . 
Some interesting references to Manu Smriti and Dasam Granth also need discussing in the way these books have been used in the article .

"Hi Eric, no. You are not in any way one of the people I was talking about. You just got caught in the crossfire, and if I made you think I was thinking of you I apologise. Your work is consistent good plus even more importantly, you have a sensitivity to other people's work with a few people don't. You build on their work to produce something that improves in quality. The people I was talking about arrive at an article, chop it around, change meanings, change context, spelling, capitalisation and then move on, more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing. 

For example, one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie the form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking the reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to Tánaiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed the word Óg from Gearóid Og Fitzgerald and Mór from Gearóid Mór Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different people (Mór = big in gaelic and indicated the father, Óg meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work he has mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biology articles, reduced an article on mediæval history to such a degree of unreadability that the author, one of the world's top mediæval historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such people. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on the basis of google searches. I checked on google. The majority of articles said he was right. Those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. But she treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, it was gospel. 

I have had political science articles which I have written and which were based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to the Droop Quota at all (that was the sixth article that day I had done that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone to do, swept in to a topic he knows little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page, if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula). That intervention was classic Michael; go onto a page about a topic he doesn't know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that, unilaterally change it, in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.

American english and British English use different approaches to capitalisation. Many of the references were to things only found outside the US and so capitalised. Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the US. That indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in the US are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in the US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in the US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, it is largely on the basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation, then another US user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the US. So any non-American user would get r",0

 Some things about the Dutch and German education systems 
The Dutch name """"Hoger beroepsonderwijs"""" (abbrev. as HBO, though HBO (disambiguation) links to the misspelled redirect Hoger Beroeps Onderwijs) links here, but this seems to be in error, as they are not the same. For example, according to this article, a vocational university can give away master, and sometimes doctorate degrees, but a HBO in The Netherlands can do neither of them. An example of such an organisation is the Hanzehogeschool Groningen. They are not allowed to use the Dutch word for """"university"""" in their Dutch name but  but rather are what we call a Hogeschool, and what German call Fachhochschule, to confuse the world, they often call themselves """"university of applied sciences"""" in the English language.

Having come to power saying that her agenda was to pare down Wasilla to ‘the basic necessities, the bare bones’, she surprised its citizens when she redecorated the mayor’s office at a reported cost of $50,000 salvaged from the highways budget; its new red flock wallpaper matched her bold, rouge-et-noir taste in personal outfits. Another $24,000 of city money went on a white Chevy Suburban, known around Wasilla, without affection, as the mayormobile. She hired a city administrator to deputise for her in the day-to-day running of Wasilla’s affairs and employed a lobbyist in DC to wheedle lawmakers into meeting the town’s ever-expanding list of claims for congressional ‘pork’ (so named from the antebellum custom of rewarding slaves with barrels of salt pork). That expenditure, at least, paid off: during Palin’s six-year tenure as mayor, the federal government doled out more than $1000 for every man, woman and child in Wasilla. Her pet project was a $14.7m ice rink and sports complex, which opened in 2004. It is said to be lightly used, it has left the city servicing a massive debt, and a Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit continues over the bungled way in which Palin acquired the land on which it’s built.TABCut, Kill, Dig, Drill London Review of Books Vol. 30, No. 19, 9 October 2008, pages 7-10, Jonathan Raban 24.17.191.27

"I realize that several people (apparently including Rama) have attempted to point to Israel's bombing of Osiraq as the catalyst for Iraq's nuclear program, but it just does not hold up to scrutiny. Iraqi defectors as well as the IAEA's post Gulf War investigations found that Iraq had a clandestine program dating back to the late 1970's. 

Most of Iraq's nuclear work was done at Al Tuwaitha. Although the IAEA had access to Al Tuwaitha, it was extremely limited with the majority of the complex off limits to IAEA inspectors because no “declared nuclear activity” was taking place there. Evidently Blix saw nothing wrong with this.

I wanted to query two things.

First, the Amdo article is about the Amdo region, not Tibet, and not the """"sovereignty debate"""". While I can see how the relations with the Mongols can be relevant, since the Mongols first incorporated Amdo into other commandaries/provinces, I don't think we need too much detail on the relations between the Mongols and Tibet - that is dealt with in other articles. Furthermore, it is bad form to use internal reference: i.e. another Wikipedia article cannot be used as a reference. Finally, this statement presents only one point of view when clearly there are several. I don't want the History section of Amdo to turn into a rehash of either History of Tibet or Tibet sovereignty debate.

I propose to cut the added paragraph to """", a relationship which the Tibetan Government-in-Exile now terms a """"patron-priest relationship"""" whereby Tibet exchanged political control for the power of religious instruction of the Khans.[ref]"""".

You claim in that diff that """"a policy which encourages editors to work together before deleting would hinder what editors who delete other editors hard work are trying to doing here"""": thanks for the blatant mischaracterization. I have worked together with many, many editors, and have achieved great results in doing so. I have also tried to upheld Wikipedia's policies in all cases, both when I deleted articles or nominated them for deletion, but also when I denied speedies, restored pages, or suggested to keep articles in AfD debates. Many of the AfD's I started were not """"other editor's hard work"""" but blatant hoaxes, copyright violations, and so on. Other's were about someone's hard work, which was just not suited for WIkipedia. We are not a free webhost, even though we have nearly unlimited space: we are an encyclopedia, and not everything is suited for inclusion.

If a source can be found that they actually are signed to a contract and not working on a by-apperance basis.   

If they can't be added to the main roster, could they be given a special category of their own due to the World X Cup?

Question 2:

Should Karen Angle be added to the active roster now that she (kayfabe) signed an """"official TNA Knockouts"""" contract?  This new contract was signed so Kurt couldn't lay a hand on her, but it also makes her open season for the other knockouts (as evidenced by Kong's attack).

Compromise (I hope): Start a Minor Houses of A Song of Ice and Fire or thereabouts. Move the info about their history there, as well as the key points there. Move complete Roose and Ramsey bios to minor characters. However, I think this particular article should be kept around for 2 reasons:
1. Simply put, it's a good idea to centralize information. Somebody who's reading minor houses and wants to read about Roose and Ramsey will find it easier and more intuitive to go to a House Bolton entry than a minor characters entry. 
2. From all indications, the Boltons will be major players in ADWD (I think Martin saying that a Theon is coming back is better than mere """"speculation""""). Every major Westerosi institution that's had a POV centered on it (major houses, Night's Watch, Citadel) has an article. It seems pointless to get rid of this now and bring it back a year later.

 Link to Article: """"The Unknown Martin Luther King, Jr.""""  

This link Article: """"The Unknown Martin Luther King, Jr."""" has twice been removed by one particular editor, first with a remark in including the words """"What's next? a link to Stormfront?"""" which I do not understand, and later to dismissing the link as """"racist"""", which like many convenience-words ending in """"ist"""" can be defined to mean whatever the user intends it to mean (often a derogatory and empowering substitute for lack of intellingent reasoned discussion).  I do not think the link is one to be treated as vandalism, which I am sorry must be common in any article about a well-known leader.  The subject matter of the linked article does not seem to be concerned with expression of a particular point of view on race (if this is what """"racist"""" means): if it did it would not be relevant to the MLK page.  But it does seem to be biographical, has some nice photographs, and is well-written and reasonable, and therefore of interest.  As an experienced (non-American, with no point of view on the subject of the article) contributor to wikipedia, I believe a variety of appropriate links to a subject is of interest, and contributes to understanding.  And a variety of independent views expressed of a subject enriches, and is the way to approach the truth, like any scientific research: it is not for editors to filter links because they contain matter showing the subject to be less than perfect - we are all human - and I can understand that this might be the reason.

Enough.  Please can there be viewpoints on the relevance of the link to MLK ?  And consensus.  Welcome from the editor mentioned above and others.  Thanks.    
We don't link to fringe sites such as AmRen without a very good reason, and there isn't one here; the article in question is an opinion piece by a non-notable grad student, and is of no particular value to the article.

 Past tense. (Apologies in advance for any typos - bad keyboard and limited time - also, I'll try to put across a coherent argument without letting emotions get in the way, but I am really angry about this (for reasons I'll explain later)) It is incorrect English to say that events happening over a 22 year span all happened at once (i.e. in the present). For example, to say that """"EastEnders begins"""" is incorrect. EastEnders began. In 1985. The article as it is at the moment (in present tense) reads like EastEnders is a film - with a set end, which we know it is not - it keeps running. It is my strong belief that events that happened in the past in something that runs in real time should also be written in real time (i.e. past tense for things that hapened in the past) - an argument that I have seen all three editors above use at different times. One of the reasons I am angry about this is that certain editors seem to have such a disregard for our language and the way it should be written, that they are willing to forget all about grammar and write this article (which, in my opinion, and as stated by Gungadin elsewhere) is harder to read than it was before, in past tense - just to get this article to FA status - how glory-seeking is that!? Don't get me wrong, it'd be great for this article to get to FA status, but to totally forget about good grammar just because the policy pushers (may I add that WP:TENSE is a guideline, not a policy) say that it needs to be in present tense juts takes the biscuit. WP:TENSE was obviously decided without taking into account real time series - something myself and Elonka have raised on various talk pages to try and change this, but as soon as I have gone away it seems everyone has changed their minds and are happy to have this article written in bad, hard to read English, just to get it to FA status.

If the voters can't see this is better in past tense, at least we all know it is deserving of FA status anyway - AND readable. -''''''(contribs) """,0

With all respect, I don't know why people only warn against personal attacks by one editor, in a dispute where rules are clearly being broken all around.  I don't think this is the way to make people feel welcome on Wikipedia.  Chussid should not make personal attacks, but other editors should not revert his multiple changes with curt explanations in the edit history.  Any normal person in Chussid's position would find this behavior extremely aggravating and would very likely resort to personal attacks, which is exactly why this kind of behavior is not allowed.   
Indeed. And the 'reasons' they give are totally outrageous. These same people DO consider www.truepeace.org which ALSO does not give any names or an address of the person(s) behind it a 'reliable source'. Because it fits in their Zionist thinking pattern.

 Disruptive Activity 

 Please stop your disruptive editing. If you continue to vandalize Wikipedia, as you did at Paracetamol, you may be blocked from editing.    🍌 (email) 

Yeah, so I add two interesting and important new, relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the Paracetamol page. These are removed because you guys don't like primary sources? This is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with Wikipedia. My wife is pregnant. I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the """"first do no harm"""" idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   

 I'm sorry that I've upset you, but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. That is why we've written WP:MEDRS which I pointed to when I reverted you. There is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at WP:WHYMEDRS. The fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results can't be transferred into clinical practise. MEDRS is no catch all, but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. I would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically, for example by having FDA warnings automatically added.

I understand it may feel as if you're being reverted by a faceless mass, but I assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive.   🍌 (email) 

 This isn't about my feelings, it is about your behavior. You revert me with no reason, then start quoting this bureaucratic nonsense, then threaten me with banning due to my disruptive editing.

Wizardman warned Heqwm that this was a personal attack. Heqwm repeated his personal attack on his own talk page. I removed the """"anti-barnstar"""" and personal attack from my talk page, but Heqwm re-added it. I discussed the charge on my talk page. And Johntes's recounting is dishonest, as it implies that my reposting the attack happened after Wizardman's warning, when in fact it happened before.

Heqwm has been at this mischief for a long time. Mischief? Insisting that liars be punished is """"miscief""""? What kind of world do we live in?

He has been warned by other users as well, and has been placed on a form of community probation. Yes, on the basis of the very lies that are the issue here.

I don't think I have any any interaction with him since then, so I can only assume he is still upset about being put on probation, or about the related mediation case which he filed and then abandoned. Abandoned after several weeks went by without any mediator stepping forward (and after Johntex engaged in behavior in blatant violation of WP:CIVIL and WP:AGF).

His talk page history is littered with controversy and conflict with many other editors on many topics. After several years, with me not deleting anything, there are now several instances of people disagreeing with me. And...?

I ask whether Heqwm has exhausted the community's patience? I ask whether this is not a clear threat and an instance of Johntex's bullying.

To top it off, another admin came along and blocked me only a few hours after Johtex's request, meaning that I had no opportunity to address the charges.

-

Jonhtex responded """"I request that Heqwm again be blocked for posting unsubstantiated personal attacks where he accuses me of lying.""""  So... Johntex is allowed to attack me on ANI, but if I respond to his charges, I should be blocked?  Yet another example of his bullying.  As for """"undsubstantiated, I have diffs and screenshots showing quite clearly that Johntex lied.

Unofficial re-review by Sasata

At the request of the original nominator, I've having a look at the article again after changes have been made.
Referencing is now much better than before. I've condensed a couple of repeating citations.

I still believe the article needs to follow standard Wikiformat, including a lead, and division of text into sections, with appropriate headers. The argument that the article is not long enough to warrant separate sections highlights one of the article's deficiencies—it doesn't give sufficient coverage to the information out there. A search of the ISI Web of Knowledge Academic Database pulls up 76 research articles (dating from 1991-2009), but only a tiny fraction of these are cited in the article. Here are some research studies that I would expect to be cited in this article:
Thorson RM. (1993). """"Postglacial offset along the Seattle fault"""". Science 260(5109): 825–826.

Discusses data that confirms Holocene movement along the fault.
Karlin RE, Abella SEB. (1996). """"A history of Pacific Northwest earthquakes recorded in Holocene sediments from Lake Washington"""". Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth 101(B3): 6137–6150.
Gives a geohistorical perspective on the fault and discussion of the secondary effects that may have been caused by the fault.
Dewberry SR, Crosson RS. (1996). """"The M(D) 5.0 earthquake of 29 January 1995 in the Puget lowland of western Washington: An event on the Seattle fault?"""" Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America 86(4): 1167–1172.
Analyses a 5.0 magnitude earthquake 25 km south of Seattle that is most certainly germaine to this article.
Thorson RM. (1996). """"Earthquake recurrence and glacial loading in western Washington"""". Geological Society of America Bulletin 108(9): 1182–1191.
Effects of glaciation/deglaciation on earthquake recurrence and its effects on current paleoseismic approaches to determine recurrence frequency.
I could go on (and on), but I think you get the point. There's a lot of research out there that hasn't been touched on in this article, and for that reason, it doesn't meet criteria 3(a) (""""it addresses the main aspects of the topic""""). I think if you were to address some of this research, the size of the article would swell up and section divisions would suggest themselves naturally. And with section headers and beefed-up text, image placement is much easier.

I'm not a fan of the outgoing links. For example, when I click on the outbound link (... local native legends) I expect to be led to a page which discusses specifically the a'yahos legend, but instead end up on a general site about Indian legends and earthquakes. Perhaps the a'yahos legend is somewhere in one of those links, but I shouldn't be expected to hunt around for it myself. If there is a specific page which discusses a'yahos, then link to it directly, and use a web citation template. If not, then this outbound link should be in the external links section (or perhaps left out completely). Similar arguments apply to the outbound link for Lidar-based mapping that appears later. I shouldn't have to go to an external site to find a definition that helps me understand the wiki article.

I hope this helps you on your quest to get this article to GA status. Good luck!   """,0
"BLP Clarification
On your Deletion Review vote on Jim Shapiro, you mentioned that you thought WP:BLP be clarified.  I'm curious as to what you mean by that.  I agree with your vote on this deleted article.  How could the BLP be better clarified?  Thanks.",0
"I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",1

When you saved the logo from the """"official"""" site, , you probably saved the file as """"doop.jpg"""" (since that's what the site calls it). The .jpg extension is a good indication that the image is in the JPEG format. If you don't see file extensions on your computer (Windows XP hides them by default), you can always right-click on any image on a Web page and select """"Properties"""" or something similar; there should be a field in the Properties window called """"Location"""" or """"Address"""" or the like that will show you the URL of the image, which is http://www.doop.org/img/doop.jpg (as before, the .jpg extension is a good indicator that the image is a JPEG). So that original image is already compressed as a JPEG, and it will already have compression artifacts.

To respond your points: 1) The National Council of Young Israel is I believe the parent body so to speak of that speaks for Young Israel type Jews - Which is what I meant by calling it """"branch of Judaism"""". I am not aware of them being an advocacy group. Perhaps you can source your statement for that. Your personal feelings on their opinions and what you imagine them advocating obviously does not count here. What matters is that they are a notable organization by WP standards (while your neighborhood association probably is not), and therefore their opinion is notable on Wikipedia too. This is in addition to the fact that they've been cited by a noteworthy newspaper, The Jewish Press. 
2) You haven't stated why their opinion is not relevant to Goldstone himself. While there has been much criticism of the Goldstone report which has been covered in that article, this criticism is specifically about giving an award to Goldstone himself and rightly relevant to an article about him and the awards he's received.

Good point  how does the title relate to the meaning of apartheid? This was discussed somewhat in the centralized Talk and the synthesis. There are two meanings of apartheid: (1st) The official self-described policy of South Africa. (2nd) Similar or analogous policies in other places. The title """"Israeli apartheid"""" uses the 2nd meaning. This seems to favor the anti-Israel side. In the suggestion that started this thread  """"Comparisons between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa"""" the word 'apartheid' has the 1st meaning. This arguably favors the pro-Israel side.

 Irgendwer=Alfrem? 

After reviewing the archive of this talk page, I'm pretty sure Irgendwer is a sockpuppet of , who has already been banned from this article ArbCom for trying to remove the phrase """"political philosophy"""" from the lead.. Both are obviously less than fluent in English, appear to enjoy addressing others as """"troll,"""" and have a tendency to say """"kindergarten"""" when especially annoyed by opposition to their edits. I have filed a request for CheckUser here.  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

When people are losing arguments to maintain their majority POV, they may change to denunciation and enforced law. This is exactly the sense of libertarianism not to be political.  

Do you deny that you are Alfrem?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Alfrem is obvisously a dead account. So your question makes no sense. But it makes clearly sense that you are a troll.  

I'm asking if you are the same person who edited under the account Alfrem. Yes or no?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Well, well, well.  You're quite the detecive, rehpotsirhc!  This is from Alfrem's talk page:

====Alfrem banned from Libertarianism====
Enacted on 19:58, July 13, 2005 (UTC)  

 Pending resolution of this matter  is banned from editing of Libertarianism. It shall be presumed that any user, such as  who makes Alfrem's trademark edit, removal of the phrase """"Libertarianism is a political philosophy,"""" from the article is a sockpuppet of Alfrem. Such sockpuppets may be banned indefinitely if practical.

According to this, it seems like  should be banned indefinitely if practical...   

Are you the Great Dictator?  

No.  Just extraplating from what was said about you earlier.  And, by the way, there is nothing unlibertarian about banning someone from a libertarian community who cannot abide by the rules designed to protect everyone's rights within that community.   For example, being refused entrance to a tie-required restaurant - for lack of wearing a tie - is consistent with libertarianism.   

 about me? Denunciation! Not even your term of sockpuppet is correct. And, by the way, you describe Wikipedia as your property but it is used as political public good.  

When you can spare 5 free min. within your dictatorship, you may deliver about the old question:
What is your concrete evidence that libertarianism must be described in its characteristic feature as """"political""""?
 

What would be an example if such evidence, if it were possible? You've already dismissed appeals to logic, highlighting of the prima facie indefinsibility of your position, and links from across pretty much the entirety of Western civilization. You don't even understand half of what is said here. Do you want a photograph? A mathematical proof? You made up your mind along time ago and won't listen to any other opinions. Now, are you Alfrem or not?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Yes, I am convinced that Irgendwer is Alfrem. They are both German, and they use similar mannerisms such as referring to libertarianism as """"L."""", """"kindergarten"""", etc. They make similar grammatical errors. And of course both accounts have only existed for the purpose of revert warring in the intro of this article. Someone should post on WP:AN. [[Use",0

As does the person about me. I think the language should be mentioned here, because it is well spoken. There are many different types. I personally speak the form of -idiga, but there are forms such as -ither, -wither, and many others. If you need research help I would be glad to. I think the acutal spoken gibberish should be mentioned.  

How to speak Gibberish
All gibberish is, is you add the prefix """"idig"""" after the first syllable of the word. then speak the rest of the word. That is all you have to do. Easy as pie. Hello would become, hidigello.

"Research shows that one of the most prominent characteristics of infant directed speech is the wider opening of the mouth that is present in those using infant directed speech versus adult directed speech.  This differences occurs especially in vowels.  Vocal pitch is also heightened during infant directed speech and research indicates vowels are spoken with the highest pitch when infant directed speech is used.  The horizontal positioning of the lips in infant directed speech does not differ significantly from positioning used in adult directed speech.  Instead, the only observed difference remains in vertical lip positioning.  By making the opening of the lips larger, infants are more likely to focus on the face of the speaker.  Research suggests that the larger the opening of the lips during infant directed speech, the better infants will understand the message being conveyed due to the additional visual cues available.  The intensity of speech, however, does not differ from that used in adult directed speech contrary to popular belief.   

Infant directed speech does not only include the characteristics of high pitched speech and elongated syllables, but also incorporates visual body movements that assist in conveying meaning of language to infants.  One monumental visual aspect of infant directed speech is the movement of the lips.  In addition, head movements are used to emphasize various syllables within language production.  These visual cues provide infants the additional information needed to perform accurate speech discrimination during language development.  Further, visual cues allow infants to discriminate speech differences in environments in which they cannot rely on their hearing, such as in noisy environments.  The auditory and visual aspects of infant directed speech do not exist independently, however.  Infants rely equally on both methods of understanding and as development continues, infants strengthen the link between these two important categories.  

It must be considered that although infant directed speech features marked characteristics, it may not only be these characteristics aiding in development of language for children.  Due to the visual cues used  by caregivers in this method of communication, infants are more highly motivated to engage in communication.  Because infants are willing to participate in this process, caregivers are able to make significant progress through the use of infant directed speech.  

It is often assumed that infants are interested in the properties of infant directed speech and play a passive role in this interaction.  However, research indicates that infants are not only attracted to the practice itself but to people who engage in infant directed speech.  Through this practice, infants are able to determine who positive and encouraging caregivers will be in their development.  When infants use infant directed speech as a determinant of acceptable caregivers their cognitive development seems to thrive because they are being encouraged by adults who are invested in the development of the given infants.",0

Speedy deletion of Phi Beta Upsilon

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guidelines for people and for organizations. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Comment from Homosexuality (workspace) 

Actually, my citation can be the very same 2000 Breedlove study that our friend in Farmington includes in Fetal hormones and sexual orientation. Background is that length of ring finger relative to index finger is strongly correlated with fetal testosterone levels. That fact is rather well established quite apart from sexual orientation. Breedlove found an additional much weaker correlation between implied fetal testosterone and sexual orientation, with lesbians in particularly being most strongly androgynized. It's definitely interesting. Gay men show the same pattern (gays more androgynized), but to a smaller degree.

However, there is a huge overlap between the suggested fetal testosterone levels and sexual orientation. That is, on average of a bunch of lesbians had higher fetal testosterone than a paired group of straight women. But many lesbians had lower fetal testosterone than the straight-woman average. And many straight women had higher fetal testosterone than the lesbian average. The standard deviation within each group is much more than the mean difference between the groups.

So what does it show? Well, I dunno. There's something potentially interesting there, especially if it can be replicated in much larger samples. But it's hardly clear causation, nor even clear correlation. What it amounts to might be something like (purely hypothetically): """"High testesterone exposure female fetuses have a 10% chance of becoming lesbian; low testosterone exposure female fetuses have a 5% chance of becoming lesbian."""" But that's about the strongest conclusion I can imagine coming out of this (and it hasn't yet, it's been suggested), and that's a relatively weak factor.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

This at least puts everything involving law and its administration in one place.  While the courts are of course part of 'government', in some states their articles were so dominating the government category, that the executive and legislative articles were losing out.  I can certainly see putting a 'see also' notice at the top of each 'government of foo' category to point to the 'foo law' category. 

Communications: Communications, of course, encompasses media, and also telephone (area codes) and mail (zip codes) and internet, etc.  I see no differenece to be made at the US level versus the state level.  Not sure that media is of such overwhelming 
importance at the state level, however, that it needs to be in multiple places or at the state level.

 Enter the Wu-Tang copy edit request 

Hello.  I looked over Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and re-phrased some things, made a few changes.  A few additional questions I had;
 In the background section, the first block quote under """"Conception"""" says something about A&R.;  What's A&R;?  I'd fix it myself but I don't know.
 Everything from the track listing on is basically a lot of lists and charts.  I wouldn't be suprised if when you re-nominate it for featured article you got some opposes based on it being too list-heavy.  A lot of what's mentioned in the Accolades chart is already mentioned in the article so you might want to think twice about that particular section.  Also, shouldn't the personnel list be in the infobox?  I think the track listing and album positions are good.  The singles information I could take or leave.  
Overall I'm impressed; I haven't seen too many album articles that were more than stubs consisting of 1-2 sentences and a track listing.  However, towards the end the article does seem a bit slow.  I'm not sure how to help with it.  
It's a pretty good article right now.  I still think it needs a little more work before you re-nominate it for featured. ~ ''''''''''(Talk|Contribs) """,0

"I'm still awaiting an explanation as to why my careful and accurate sourcing of statements in this article was vandalized while I was away during the past three weeks.  When I added the archival sources many months ago, they were approved by a Wikipedia editor.  Moreover not only were the archival references recently vandalized, but also the reference to my published article in Brief Chronicles, a peer-reviewed academic journal, was deleted.  These archival sources cannot be characterized as 'original research'.  As noted earlier on this page, Alan Nelson's book is merely a series of quotations from these same archival sources stitched together with a bit of commentary.  If my transcripts of these archival sources (readily available to everyone on my webpage) are 'original research' and thus to be banned under Wikipedia's policy, then so is Alan's book, for the same reason, namely that it's largely a series of quotations from archival sources.  And as stated earlier, Alan misinterprets these sources, thus generating factual errors.  For example, re the Brincknell incident, Alan deliberately conflates William Waters, one of the jurors in the coroner's inquest into the death of Thomas Brincknell, and Oxford's servant, William Walter.  On p. 48, Alan writes of the coroner's inquest that:

>The 17 jurymen were, however, as compliant as the jury was packed: one juryman, William Waters, was Oxford's own servant.<

Alan clearly knew this statement to be false since he himself transcribed the testimony of Oxford's servant, William Walter, in a 1599 lawsuit in which William Walter described himself as being 50 years of age on 8 May 1599.  See Alan's transcript at:

http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/RUSWEL/ruswel07.html

Oxford's servant, William Walter, was thus almost the same age as the 17-year-old Oxford at the time of Thomas Brincknell's death, and could not possibly have served on a jury at that age.  The juryman William Waters was obviously an entirely different person from Oxford's servant, William Walter.  Because he did not like the jury's finding that the death was the result of Brincknell's own actions, Alan deliberately made a false statement about one of the jurors to impugn the jury's finding.  This is merely one among dozens of examples I could cite which demonstrate that no 'fact' stated in Alan's book can be accepted without checking it against archival documents. Nina Green",0

Perhaps. Generally, if something is commonly known as exactly """"Dallas"""", that should be listed on the disambiguation page. People (or characters) with the given name or surname may be moved to a separate page as they are partial title matches. That would suggest that Dallas (Alien) should remain on the disambiguation page. But the page could perhaps be reorganized to make it easier to use. Perhaps a section for == People and character == with entries for Dallas (name) and Dallas (Alien) (sometimes a hiddden comment is added to remind editors to only add an entry if it is known as exactly the term being disambiguated).  ≠ wiser

 0-by-0 matrix 

(I'm starting a new subsection to distinguish my comments from the previous unsigned section.)

Because of the connection with linear transformations, it is important to allow 0-by-n and n-by-0 matrices.

In response to MattTait, the determinant of the unique 0-by-0 matrix is not 0, but 1.  There are several ways to see this:
If one defines the determinant as a sum over permutations of products of entries, there is one permutation of the empty set, and the corresponding product is the empty product, which is 1.
If one wants the computation of determinants by expansion by minors to work on nonzero 1-by-1 matrices, the determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix must be 1.
One can also compute how the corresponding linear transformation multiplies 0-dimensional volume.
The determinant of a block matrix 
A 0
0 B
is the product of det(A) and det(B).  For this to hold when A is 0-by-0 and B is a nonsingular matrix, one must define det(A)=1.   

 Order of a matrix 

I don't think this use of """"order"""" is common in current mathematical literature.  To me, a matrix of order 3 would more likely be a matrix M such that M^3 = I.  I think it is better to stick with the standard terminology """"dimensions"""".

I think it is more common to write , not , for the space of m-by-n matrices with entries in F.  (I do understand that it is in bijection with linear maps from  to .)   """,0

One other thing.  Wealth distribution is a separate and distinct issue from the issue of money creation and distribution.  They are related and they do interact, but they are distinct issues.  Many Libertarians (such as Ron Paul) couldn't care less about wealth distribution provided the way in which money creation is just and in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.  Free markets can determine wealth distribution - provided the way in which money is created is open and democractically approved and """"just"""" and the product of rational discussion (i.e. not based on the threat of a bullet to the head if you question the current method of money creation and distribution).  Once new money is created, it gets gets circulated according to the tax laws, and competition laws, and finance laws and a multitude of other factors, and ends up in someone's account somewhere.  Money creation is (arguably) much more important and has many more dynamic implications for an economy than wealth distribution, which is a separate issue.  Again, this confusion shows that the level of understanding of these issues is woeful and I despair at ever increasing the general public's understanding of these vitally important issues, especially given the limitless $$$s financing the countervailing forces (Gregalton, Zenwhat, etc) that are lined up against anyone questioning the sustainability and pointing out the absolute stupidity of the current debt-based system.

"for the stated facts - it's a primary source for the text of the judgement, but a secondary source for the facts in the Findings Of Fact",0
", 27 April 2012 (UTC)
The real issue here is that OFSTED reports are primary sources, just as the Crested report is a primary source. We have a situation where editors are each trying to interpret these primary sources and adding their own spin in line with their own opinions. It's really neither here nor there what I think or what Fmph thinks, it is how the primary sources are interpreted in secondary sources that counts. We effectively have original research here where editors are try to interpret these reports themselves and cite from them selectively and not setting the reports in the appropriate context. To answer Sailmfadhley's question, OFSTED reports do sometimes get reported in local newspapers, usually if they receive an outstanding rating or if the school is put into special measures. I can't find any newspaper reports relating to the inspections at Woodleigh. It tends to be the worst-performing schools that attract the attention of secondary sources. For The Ridings School for example it is entirely appropriate to quote from OFSTED reports as they were widely cited in the national press. There might well be a need to cite the latest inspection report but in this case the most recent report is rather brief and focused on issues like flooring, bathing facilities and the general state of the accommodation rather than the education of the pupils. We don't normally include information about such matters in school articles. This is also not by any means a typical OFSTED report. All the OFSTED reports for this school have a much narrower focus than the usual OFSTED reports as they are concerned primarily with the boarding provision and the related health and safety and child welfare issues which in itself offers an unbalanced view of the school. Normally independent schools get inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate, but I cannot find any recent report from the ISI.   18:04",0

"""First of all, the Gibson report is not a government report. Not that it matters, because stating that government reports are by nature reliable is ridiculous. Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.  

I'm sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in 'spurious arguments'. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.

But in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion """"the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary"""" DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say. And just because you can't be bothered to study the points does not make the points irrelevant! I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don't seem to be following them. I suggest that certain people stop pulling Wiki-rank 'I know more about Wiki than you' and act responsibly in this, for Wikipedia and the subject concerned, if not for a patient community.

How does the language of the Franks, which is known more or less from place names and personal names only plus a few borrowed words, tell us anything about their ethnicity? We knew they were Germanic before that. Are you implying that there is a connection between Dutch and Frankish """"ethnicity""""? That connection, though it is probably there, is not very direct over a thousand five hundred years...
I don't know why the fact that a Frankish-derived language (Dutch) being spoken in a certain region (the Netherlands) should force us to believe that the Franks were originally from there. Of course the two facts are related, but the fact of the language being spoken there does not itself tell us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Franks any more than the fact that a Latin-derived language is spoken in Belgium tells us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Romans. Again, I understand the connection, but it is not made on linguistic analysis alone. This is why most books/articles on the Franks that I've read (Wallace-Hadrill, Bachrach) don't mention Dutch. Your comment about Franci seniores (what does the Franci superiores have to do with anything?) does nothing to explain to me the importance of their language. Their well-attested written language was Latin. Why not mention that? In fact, it tells us far more about the Franks than that they spoke a proto-Dutch language. 
As to the remarks concerning the pertinence of my comments only for the Merovingian period, I was not aware that the article was about the development of a language and not about the Franks, a term which does not have a consistent universal ethnic/tribal meaning by the end of the 9th century (and probably by the end of the 8th). 
In short, I don't see how you have actually answered the objection. I don't know what """"German"""" point of view you think I have, but I find that ridiculous. And shouldn't a minority of scholarship moreso undermine your """"Dutch"""" point of view? Finally, when did I declare myself a Carolingian specialist? I have no specialty.  """,0

 Further response.... 

Mr. Galal, you seem, perhaps, frustrated. This is understandable, since you work for Medcan and you surely want the Wikipedia article to include only promotional information. However, Wikipedia strives to tell the whole truth. 
- If wikipedia strives to tell the whole truth, then you should say that even though the Danish Meta Study brings up valid arguments regarding physical examinations and their impact on health outcomes, generally speaking physical examinations are widely accepted and useful healthcare screening tools. I suspect every first world country recommends medicals with a General Practitioner - your comment is stating that these countries health organizations and policy makers are incorrect. And that medicals schools are also incorrect in their lessons.  And we may as well change how medicine is practiced and treat people when they get sick, not try to catch disease early.

The meta-study itself is fairly recent (just two years old). It was brought to us thanks to the prestigious Cochrane Collaboration. I see no reason why a Danish meta-study would be inapplicable to Canada, though you are welcome to try to convince me otherwise.

I won't dispute your point that most people in First World countries undergo routine physical examinations. And I won't dispute that they are customary. But have they been proven to be useful? Not to my knowledge.
- This is an astonishingly closed minded comment.  Medcan alone has hundreds of cases where we've saved peoples lives, improved there lives, provided them insight for future care, etc.  The word """"useful"""" is vague - useful as in leading a healthier life?  Absolutely.  Useful as in keeping someone alive who has a terminal illness - probably not.

I think there is more than enough here for you to understand why we have such an issue with this comment on the Medcan wikipedia page.  If this was an Encyclopedia - there is not a chance it would be posted.  There is no facts or evidence that the Danish study is 100% true - and Medcan's model of care is not just to diagnose, but to also help people through lifestyle modifcation and coaching.""",0

Exactly, Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song """"Behind These Hazel Eyes"""". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called """"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes"""", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like """"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved"""". I like the """"problem solved"""" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.

TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?

I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote """"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?"""" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.

If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.

My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  """,0

As to """"favorable vs. unfavorable,"""" if that's truly how I felt, such incidents articles wouldn't exist. I've gone through with SpikeJones and other editors to keep everything consistent, first getting involved with them after the monorail accident in July 2009, when this exact same issue came up, and again consensus was that leaving out the victim's name didn't damage the article, nor did it add any significant value to it (at which point, tie goes to """"leave it out""""). After that, it was the rash of lewd-behavior incidents at Central Florida water parks ... again, if I was trying to protect the parks, I wouldn't have allowed the information in, as if it were completely up to me, anyway. Heck, I added a number of them into their respective articles, and I fleshed out others with more details and more source information to back it all up! (In the interest of full disclosure, the victims in those incidents were generally minors, which (a) wouldn't have been named by the news and (b) if some unscrupulous person had gotten a hold of the names, I have no doubt the names would be expunged immediately and nobody who really had the project's best interests at heart would put up a fight. In not so many words, while also incidents, they did have special conditions that don't make them good examples in this dispute.)

These incidents articles are based purely on what's in the local newspapers, with no candy-coating, no PR spin ... save one thing, which has been followed with almost all the incident/accident articles I've reviewed, both theme-park and non-theme-park. Unless they were already notable, victims' names aren't included, because they aren't necessary to, as you put it, tell the story. There are, of course, exceptions (such as the victims of the Titanic), but the theme park incident articles are consistent.

Lastly, as to your assertion of WP:COI, I'd welcome any proof you'd care to provide in regards to edits being made currently. Previous COI edits, such as those that inspired the newspaper article you cited, should indeed be expunged and replaced by neutral point of view information. But that's an issue for another day.

Hi, thanks for your comments, they will definitely be helpful in getting the article to a point where it's appropriate for more general audiences and not just trained linguists. To answer some of your specific questions:
 fómhar has [u:] in some dialects because the rule that mid vowels are raised to high vowels before nasals (including the formerly nasal mh) applies to ó in many dialects. This reminds me that I didn't discuss that raising in the article at all, so I'll add a new section about it presently.
 F and bh/mh/v are often pronounced with the bilabial fricatives  instead of the labiodental [f, v]. Unfortunately, the published sources aren't very specific about when which versions are used. The same is true for palatal vs. palatovelar (not that there's a huge difference between the two in the first place  any individual speaker probably uses both interchangeably without even hearing a difference)
 Sometimes the standard orthography does a very poor job of representing a particular dialect's pronunciation of a word. In the dialect I got the info from, scanradh happens to be pronounced as if spelled scamhradh. The pronunciation of cam is /kaum/ per the discussion of lengthening/diphthongization before fortis sonorants.
 Exactly how the fortis and lenis sonorants differ changes from dialect to dialect, as I tried to show in the chart. There isn't one unified pronunciation of the two types.
 Images of the vocal tract like the one you link to are fine for consonants, but not much use for vowels as the differences between nearby vowels are too slight to be easily seen in them. Also, they belong more on the pages about the sound in question than in this article.
 I'm sorry if your heart sinks at the word """"largely"""", but this page really isn't intended to help you get from spelling to pronunciation. (That's what Irish orthography is for.) This page is for describing how Irish is pronounced by native speakers, regardless of the spelling. The realizations of sh are also discussed at Irish orthography, though some discussion of the alternations between [h] and [ç] would probably not be amiss here.
 I'll see what I can find about stríoc. There's no epenthesis when cn gn is pronounced cr gr, because epenthesis is found only in Munster, and cr gr for cn gn is found only outside Munster.
 """"...[at abstract level] vowel-initial words... all begin with either a front or back glide that triggers either palatalization or velarization... Is there a way to determine what is being triggered in each particular case?"""" Well, from the orthography, yes (if it starts with e or i, palatalization is triggered; if it it starts with a, o, or u, velarization is triggered), but from a purely phonological point of view, no. It has to be included as part of the lexical information of the word.
 """"Alternation"""" in the table refers to the fact that some forms of a word (e.g. the nominative case) have one sound (e.g. a long vowel) with other related forms (e.g. the genitive) have another sound (e.g. a short vowel).

Hello Mr.feedhigh 
there are few things i want to make you clear
1)
why I wrote descended from """"old royal families in Nepal"""" not just Mallas is because i have some tangible evidence for this """" I myself is a newar and I think you know for a fact that most newars has an old god or a place dedicated to worship the old gods called """" Kul devta / kul devta mandir"""". Our temple is located in Balkumari hill (near Balkumari mandir in Patan) according to the """"purohit """" of the temple who also happens to be our """"purohit"""" (Sorry I can't find a good translation for this word """"purohit"""" in english) has a recorded document (I can provide the document if you like to examine it, also give you the contact address of the purohit himself, whos living near Mangal Bazzar even today) states that the """"kul devta"""" temple was erected at the time of Bhaskar verma by his second son Diwakar verma as a tribute to the god called """"Bhairav"""" and thats how were descended and still worship the same place and temple even till this day. Also according to the same purohit we adopted """"Shrestha"""" (changed from Verma) in the time of jayasthitti Malla (the reasons purohit told my there was a lot of instability in Patan and family feuds happening , but am not sure the exact reasons. If you want details, like I said I can give you the contact of  the """"purohit"""" who gave me this information you can also go to him to examine the document. Hence, this is the reason I wrote descended from old royal families in Nepal.

2)
Second you removed [during shah dynasty] yes it seems ironic serving the same people who later happen took our whole race out of power but there is a lot of history here too and history has to be written as it happened . What can i say is that you have to accept defeat sometimes , but it doesn't mean we will always be defeated , or accept that defeat for all eternity ( All I want to say is .This 2006 revolt where you probably think a  lot of Newars participated is not the only revolt that Newars has supported , if you look at history from the time of Damodar Pandey to Ranas, lot of Newars has reovlted , be it from house of Tripura from bhaktapur or others that followed it , but as always these revolt has been hijacked , for the most recent I wold like to give you the name Puspe Kamal Dahal """"prachande"""" .As always there is one prachande in the story. Like I said history has to be written as it is . I personally come from a family where my forefathers served as general and strategists for Shah Dyansty , my Great grand father was the first person to open a soda factory in Nepal ( even King Mahendra was astonished that we could make soda in Nepal) he also did a lot of things but am not here to publicize my family . What I want to remind you is that not all the Shah kings were anti Newar . There were Shah kings who patronize Newar's Arts and Language too in history. and I think we have to credit them for this and not forget them.

I'm sure you don't want an 8-page report on the differences between the various groups, so I created a diagram for your convenience. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, I think it shows what I could scratch the surface with in about 10,000 words. Adding citations might bring it up to 12,000, but the ratios involved will always be subjective. I will never be able to get a million Jews to sign a statement that they are against Zionism, for instance, but based on the people I've talked to, I think that about 35% to 40% are. That percentage could be off, but I personally have talked to many people of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds, from all around the world, who think that the methods of the Zionists are despicable, and who will not fight with the Zionists when the end comes and the sides are chosen.

If you believe President Bush when he says, """"If you are not with us, you are against us,"""" then it looks like the sides have already been chosen. I don't think there's very many people with the side of the Crusaders and Zionists. If the only other position is against the Crusaders and Zionists, then I feel comfortable with the numbers of my side during the upcoming apocolypse.

I started this article because someone in al-Qaeda asserted that al-Qaeda is the same as the Front. It isn't, so I changed the al-Qaeda article to more accurately describe it as a subset of the Front. After that, people wanted to know what the Front was, so I started this article. I didn't put the original reference to the Front in the al-Qaeda article; I merely clarified it. There are a lot of groups in Islam that don't like the United States or Israel. I realize that its easier to combine many of these groups into a general idea when talking about them, but thinking of the larger International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders, which is really more of a movement, as the same thing as al Qaeda, is perhaps too much of a generalization. You could generalize the World Islamic Front as loose enough to be the same thing as the International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders except that the World Islamic Front only has Islamic members. That means that most of the people in Bush's """"against us"""" category could not be part of the World Islamic Front.

Your assertion that """"bin Laden certainly would have no part of such a front as you describe,"""" is absolutely untrue. bin Laden isn't a racist. He encourages any group that helps his cause and has often appealed to American and Jews to control the crimes being committed in their names by their leaders.  """,0

confused state of """"medieval"""" connections
The questions are the following:
did George V actually adopt the Jerusalem cross, and if so, what is our evidence for this?
does this have anything to do with the flag shown for Sivas (Savasto) in the Spanish """"Book of All Kingdoms""""? If so, what is the connection,  seeing as Sivas was never part of the kingdom of Georgia?
when the current flag was designed in the early 1990s, were the people who made the flag aware of these supposed medieval connections? Or were they simply pointed out later by vexillologists? What is the earliest reference to the post-1991 flag?  Adoption by the  United National Movement dates to c. 1999.  Kldiashvili wrote a """"History of the Georgian heraldry"""" in 1997. So what we are looking for is information from Kldiashvili, and if possible information on the period of 1991 to 1997.

I am under the impression that seagrasses are the only truly marine plants. Everything else either isn't really marine, e.g. mangroves are essentially terrestrial; or isn't really a plant e.g. seaweeds are algae.... Although come to think of it the latest thinking has the Chlorophyta amongst the Plantae. But leaving aside the navel gazing (if I can; I'll try), I say that """"marine plants"""" and """"seagrasses"""" are essentially synonymous, and personally I prefer the latter term. Hesperian 
 I was going to say 'proper plants, but http://florabase.calm.wa.gov.au/marineplants/ were fast and loose: includes both marine angiosperms and a variety of marine macro-algae. cygnis insignis

If this is true, we should keep in mind that this info should ultimately be on the page for this topic.  The trick is supporting that it's true, of course.  I looked at your source for the ballot, and it's unclear to me how recent the information on that page is (I couldn't find a date of publication for the info, and my half-knowledge of Spanish may be insufficient to help me know whether this is or is not the current government's ballot for the upcoming elections (as opposed to the ballot as it had existed previously, before the crisis).  But if it is the current government's version of the ballot, that's interesting, especially since it seems like César Ham in particular should be disqualified by Article 239 just as it was argued Zelaya was.  (Possibly Reyes as well, but definitely Ham given that he participated in the """"reclaiming of the ballots"""" thing.)  That's an inconsistency in the argument of the Micheletti side.

I note that this is a Honduran source, which may not be admissible under the current """"Honduran newspapers are likely to be mouthpieces for the establishment, so they're not reliable sources"""" view which has been prevailing here, but it's unlikely a pro-Micheletti source, on the other hand, would lie about what Micheletti's formal position is.  We could probably trust it to print what Micheletti says will be on the ballot.  I'm more concerned that I'm not sure the source you've posted here has a date indicating that it is the current version of the ballot.   """,0

"""Jackson didn't perform at the WMA because he can't sing at all anymore. That is the real reason he hasn't toured for a decade, along with his bankruptcy. Even his vocals on """"We've Had Enough"""" four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with, certainly not comparable with the real King, Elvis Presley. Jackson has had financial problems since at least 1998 due to his declining sales and popularity, as well as his inactivity and having to support all his siblings and parents. In 2002 it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and after losing those lawsuits in May 2003 he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of $400 million. Invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album, """"Dangerous"""", and it was thoroughly mediocre music. Almost all of Jackson's remaining fans regard it as his worst album. In 1989 Jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the King of Pop - a meaningless, self-proclaimed title. He even planned to buy Graceland so he could demolish it, which certainly says far more about Jackson's megalomania than it does about Presley. Half the songs on the Dangerous album weren't good, especially the unbelievably awful Heal the World, and it only sold 30 million copies on the strength of his previous three albums. Yeah, WJ was unique all right, but the less said about that the better. You must know some very sad 20-year-olds if they still admire the disgraced former King of Pop. Anyway, most people know him as Wacko Jacko. Justin is the real King of Pop and like Eminem he just doesn't want to risk offending WJ's fans. Justin will continue to perform, while Jackson's active career finished a decade ago. ( )

Dear C.Fred, this is ridiculous. I'm just conveying a fact, and Wikipedia is blocking me as soon as I do. I'm like the boy that states the fact that the emperor is naked, and you're among the public that tells him to be quiet. Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me? Anything that isn't right on the point? Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease. Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded. It is ridiculous, ridiculous... 

I thus contest being blocked for telling the truth. I argue that if telling the truth in itself is a reason for being blocked, then Wikipedia can certainly not be allocated to the category 'encyclopedia', since the definition of this concept surely must include telling the truth (to the best of its ability). If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the """"explanation"""" of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make """"heads and tails"""" of. If it belongs in an encyclopedia, then I'm Santa, Cladism is not science, but rather a reaction against science). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )""",0

Qwyrxian, let me attempt to point out the flaws of your response to my arguments set forth above: Yes, I'm a new editor, however, with all due respect, that has no bearing on your inclination to decide on behalf of all viewers what should be made available to them.

I very much understand the purpose of Wikipedia.  My assertion is NOT that the middle-finger incident should be included in the subject article (I started) because of news reports, as you contend.  If you will review the foregoing, the reason why I cited the news reports is because a flagrantly reckless comment was inserted that what is of issue now is not worthy of documenting when the exact opposite is true; the news reports is best evidence in that regard, and the person who said it is not worthy has only but his mouthan inferior source of 'evidence,' relatively speaking.  It is noteworthy, and, if you can come to appreciate the context of the subject's profession and for which has become known to be involved in, then you'll come to appreciate the significance it plays out in the essential need to properly reflect the entirety of the trial in which the subject became a major fixture as co-counsel.

Your example of everyday political speeches is seriously an aytypical example by which to convey your point:  Contrary to a mudane, everyday speech, here, an attorney just allegedly got out of court in obtaining a siginficant finding in his client's favordefeating immense odds and seemingly going against the court of public opinionand just afterwards gathered with his team at a restaurant just down the street from that historic victory, during which he released the manifestation of his emotions, etc., as one could imagine.  This was included as part of a segment of the whole article of the article-there is no article specifically on this incident, so let's also come to appreciate that.

And, to the contrary that this incident is of interest only at the moment, more and more discussions are being held about the audacious incident, and has cultivated an interest in what happens next, as if it is leading to a whole host of other actions (whether that includes the filing of a bar complaint, etc.), and this leads us to the national grand scale interest of the audacity of officers of courts acting in such a manner, etc.

Furthermore, I concede that Wikipedia is not in existence for the greater good, and that was never my contentio.  Again, you misunderstood the context I place in the words, """"public interests."""" Going back to the above, it is incontrovertible that is of the interests of the public, and, consequently, it should be documented well because, as noted in the latter paragraph, it is beginning to take shape in having a lasting impact on what we have come to expect from individuals, such as the subject of the article.

Let otherscertainly at least those who helped me in creating the articlechime in with their thoughts before you take an action on behalf everyone else.  Let's not do something in such a haphazard way.  Do not deny information in haste.   """,0

 CNN Article - Got some citations for you. Please Help Me with the Unreliably Sourced Statement 

Hi. I saw your comments on the CNN talk page in which you claimed - in response to another user's claims that CNN had a liberal bias - """"Please add citations to back your claims. Avoid using weasel words when making claims."""" Well, here are some peer-reviewed, scholarly articles to back that claim:
>Jeffrey N. Weatherly, et al, “Perceptions of Political Bias in the Headlines of Two Major News Organizations,” Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics (2007) (12), 91 at p. 97 (finding that “Overall, participants . . . rated the headlines from CNN as significantly more liberal than those from FOX News. . . . CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”)
>Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, Harvard University, & Project for Excellence in Journalism, “The Invisible Primary – Invisible No Longer: A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign,” p. 32  (noting that “The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates—by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”)
Please note that at the beginning of the CNN article (fourth paragraph down), the following statement appears: """"Among the general public, CNN has a more centrist perception.” The source for this proposition is FAIR, FAIR being a “progressive media criticism organization” whose “target invariably is bias on the right” . Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. Will you please help me to get rid of this statement on the CNN article? It not only is backed by a patently biased source, it is actually REFUTED by peer-reviewed, university-sanctioned sources. Thanks.   """,0

"Here are some further facts about inflation:

Inflation is always and everywhere the destruction of value in money. This destruction is transferred to constant real value non-monetary items never or not fully updated by the application of the stable measuring unit assumption under the Historical Cost Accounting model since money is the universal unit of account. Monetary inflation is an economic process resulting in the destruction of the real value of monetary items over time leading to an increase in the general level of prices. Historical Cost Accounting inflation is the Historical Cost Accounting practice of never or not fully updating constant real value non-monetary items resulting in their destruction at the rate of inflation when they are never updated or at a lower rate when they are only partly updated over time.

Hi, everybody. I just stumbled by this little edit war, and would like to make a few suggestions. As this article stands, it's a jumbled mess. I believe that Marie is correct, in that some semblance of encyclopedic structure needs to be used in this article. I have great respect for Logger9's expertize in these subjects that so greatly interest me, and his willingness to back everything up with a source. However, to Logger9, I think a liitle guidance may be helpful in composing a proper encyclopedia structure. Encyclopedic writing is not like scientific writing.

To make it simple, an encyclopedia needs to be written in a journalistic format. The most important information is delivered as quickly as possible, in the first few sentences. This is done using the fewest amount of words possible, and should written so even a child can make snese of it, (at a 6th grade level). We call this the """"lede,"""" and the only purpose of the lede is to answer the question, """"What is a liquid?"""" It should be no more than a paragraph or two.

On a subject such as this, an """"intro"""" section would be appropriate. This is just an expanded lede. This may seem a bit redundant, but is actually extremely useful. Some people coming to this article will know absolutely nothing about science, and don't want the feeling of being thrown into a college level class head first. The intro should be written at about a 10th grade level, explaining the scientific aspects in the simplest of terms. (Imagine you're teaching a 10th grade science class. How would you explain it to them?)

Then, the following sections should get into college level explanations. It is perfectly acceptable to describe well established theories, and the histories behind those theories, but be careful to make it brief. The article is meant to answer the question of what a liquid is, and should not stray into the History of liquid theory. Also, when giving theory, realize that a scientific theory is really just a very well thought opinion, and should be attributed to its source. Under no circumstances should we combine theories in a way that might lead the reader to a third conclusion, unintended by the original sources. Nor should we give the impression that any theory is somehow absolute truth.

Also, you will find that most readers want information to be in its correct place. I have seen instances in the past where information was copied and pasted directly from one article to the next. This sort of redundency is usually unnecessary. It's better to add a link to the article where the info is most relevant. And, it is also very distasteful in writing to copy, even from oneself. If it is absolutely necessary to have the same info in multiple articles, then the writing should still be original. The goal is to make articles succinct ... to fulfill the readers curiosity about a subject and only that subject, but to link to any related subject that may further the reader's knowledge. By using this format, it helps satisfy everyone's curiosity before they become bored and move on.

To Marie, I'm glad you explained that English is not your first language, because at first I did think the tone was a little harsh, but now it makes sense. I think Logger9 has some very useful contributions to make, so I'd love to see a discussion on how to incorporate them into appropriate places. I'm fascinated by the science, and would love it if we all could work together to make it understandable to all. (I'm sure you both are far more knowledible than I am.) To everybody, please use your edit summaries! There are many people watching, and edit summaries save us all alot of time.   """,0

 Carbon-Carbon 

Perhaps that could use a little more explanation, then. Carbon brakes  are carbon on carbon, in that the material is used as both brake pad and disc. However, the material used is a carbon-carbon composite: carbon fibres set in a carbon matrix (see Reinforced carbon-carbon for more technical stuff). It could actually be either reason I suppose, but they are normally referred to as 'carbon-carbon'. The topic is discussed in greater detail further down the article - I've put a '(see below)' at the first appearance of 'carbon-carbon' which links to the 'Technical innovation' section further down.

Thanks for all the further edits - I've only reverted one (sorry! -)). The direct quote from Michael Scarlett about the MRD/merde connection shouldn't be corrected (ellipsis is acceptable), even if wrong grammatically, since that's what he wrote. Unless I've misquoted of course, which I'll check when I can get my hands on the article.

One question - I don't understand why in """"He also became the first man to win a Formula One race in a car bearing his own name..."""" 'race' is now in italics. 'Race' as opposed to what?

Also - are you sure about removing non-breaking spaces for units? My recollection is that they are recommended.

Somewhat earlier  correctly observed that """"a citation for that formal definition of equality with domain but not codomain could be useful in that discussion"""".  The citation I gave is from Tom Apostol Calculus, page 54, but this is rather old.  Looking in recent literature was very instructive.  The problem is that definitions of function equality in the literature seem rare somehow (not found in about a dozen of recent math and CS books where such a definition could be expected).  Googling on """"function equality"""" or """"equal functions"""" was equally ineffective, but """"functions f and g are equal"""" yields many results (mostly lecture notes).  Some definitions of function equality include codomain equality, some do not. Here are a few that do not include codomain equality, as requested:

http://solitaryroad.com/c303.html
 http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs103/handouts/25%20Functions.pdf
 http://www.bus.ucf.edu/sgerking/ECO%203401/Chapter%202.ppt
 http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m3000/lecture8a.pdf
 http://www.cse.unl.edu/~cse235/files/Functions.ppt

An interesting subtlety: many of the latter group define a codomain, but do not include it in the definition of function equality.  As Leibniz would say, this means that they do not really consider the codomain as part of the definition of a function.  More subtle: some talk about """"the domain of f"""" but about """"the codomain"""" (without """"of f"""").

A pragmatic observation: authors including a codomain (say Y) in the definition of a function seem to do very little with it, except (i) defining when a function is """"onto"""" instead of """"onto Y"""", (ii) allowing it to restrict flexibility in the way functions can be combined, for instance, by composition.

 WP:AFC on Marathonios 

Note: The following post by an IP about Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Tiberius Claudius Hipparchus Marathonios has been copied here from User talk:EdJohnston/Anontalk.   

Thank you for taking the time to review my proposed article! As the source of the wealth of Herodes Atticus probably was his grandfather, i thought some sentences could exist for him, having also an interesting story. His name is (or almost is) as set in my article, through many sources (of which a mentioned in the article only one):
http://www.geni.com/people/Tiberius-Claudius-Hipparchus-de-Marathon/6000000013238402549
http://www.muldermedia.com/roots/INDIs/II2429.html
http://www.genealogieonline.nl/kwartierstaat-vermaat/I8432.php

Marathonios shows descent from Marathon, a famous town of Attica. It was usual at the time to always add the town to which one was belonging. So, most of the times one was using only his first name, but among faraway people the town was used as well (Thales of Miletus or Miletios etc). Whether Wikipedia's policy is to use the full name or just the first i cannot tell and i would appreciate your advice.
But.. in this article http://mapyourinfo.com/wiki/en.wikipedia.org/Herodes%20Atticus/ (see Ancestry) Wikipedia already uses that exact name!  
Probably the right spelling might have been Marathonius, as all the name in in latin, but mostly is mentioned as Marathonios, so i would vote this way.

Thanks for your note. If you create future AFC nominations, the record-keeping is easier if you will create an account, instead of using a variety of IP addresses. My original AFC comment was based on the linked sources not supporting your submission. It appeared to me that bits of information about different ancient figures were being mixed up together. This runs of the risk of an article misinforming our readers. In your above post, geni.com etc are not considered to be WP:Reliable sources for Wikipedia. The Google Book is OK but it only confirms that Herod Atticus's grandfather was known as Tiberius Claudius Hipparchus, without the word 'Marathonios'. So your information has no reliable source. Herod Atticus may have had a relative known as 'Marathonios', but that seems to be a different person who was born after the death of Hipparchus.    """,0
"Article on Sexual Orientation 

Thanks for the information you sent on signing edits, however, I had problems using it.  Unfortunately, I did not sign my most recent changes because I could not find the place to add my signature.

I have added three links I believe enrich the discussion on sexual orientation.  All links regarding prostaglandins and sexual behavior/development are relevant to the discussion of whether sexual orientation is determined from birth.  Moreover, the paper by Amateau and McCarthy the one by Sanders are of interest for raising the issue of epitestosterone's influence on brain gender and sex behavior.  

Recently, epitestosterone and the T/E ratio have received a great deal of attention in the press, and given that the upswing of endocrine research on homosexuals started with a paper that found significantly lowered excretion of testosterone and epitestosterone in homosexual men, the GLBT community should be aware of this research (see Endocrine Function in Male and Female Homosexuals, Loraine et al. 1970; and Sex Hormones and Male Homosexuality, Meyer-Bahlburg 1977).",0

"incorrect interpretation! 

The european translator, assumed that since hafez was a follower of sufism and love in sufism had sometimes been pederastic, therefore the beloved should have been a young boy. Well, I am looking at the persian version of the verses translated by  Henry Wilberforce-Clarke, and as person whose mother tongue is persian it seems to me that the beloved was an adult female rather than a young boy. Since hafez is using pronouns to refer to his beloved and the cupbeareand, one could go both ways but in persian we always use the phrase 'lock of hair of the beloved' to refer to females (since they have long hair you know). Besides anyone who is familiar with hafez poetry and have an advance understanding of medieval persian language, would know that Hafez is very unlikely to have pederastic inclinations.

Besides being inconsistent, your criteria are arbitrary.
And they are your criteria. You've got a serious problem with ownership of this article; it's very nice that you've done so much work on it, but if you want to enforce your own version on everyone else, Wikipedia is not the place to be publishing.
How ironic that you're complaining about me removing """"relevant cited information"""" (ie. one guy's opinion) from the introduction while you are at the same time removing relevant cited information from the body. Scholars describe it as a genre. That is enough.
You claim that adding this genre makes the list useless to the reader, but that's a very silly claim, because quite the opposite is true: suppressing genres because of the opinion of one writer (or really, because of the opinion of one editor) makes Wikipedia a less useful and trustworthy reference. In Rescue opera, we can go into detail about scholars' thoughts on its coherency as a genre, but the list structure of this article is not set up to deal with competing theories: Charlton's opinion that everyone else is wrong has no place here, and certainly not pride of place.

"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",0

"""

Sad that some editors jumped to conclusions without reading or analyzing the article or using the proper AfD process, but I recognize that there is a lot of emotion these days. It took over an hour to build the article but seconds were spent to kill it.

First I carefully reviewed (again) the BLP policies so I could carefully follow them. Than I used the Article Creation Template (or whatever its called) with it's step by step questions. The result of those questions was to create the article. I also check that there are no conflicting articles.  The less than ideal article name is because there is a completely unrelated http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha (an Russian Olympic mascot, not a person). When a last name is known, obviously the article would be renamed.

Next I did not just paste in some news report. I stitched together various reports in a logical topical arrangement using unique language plus direct quotes from involved people. 

I created it from a variety of sources (over 7 different ones anyway) and ref'd the heck out every statement per BPL which says """"We must get the article right. Be very firm about the use of high-quality sources. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be explicitly attributed to a reliable, published source, which is usually done with an inline citation. Contentious material about living persons (or in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced – whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable – should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion."""". Before saying this is a BLP violation please show which statements were not reliably sourced to published sources with inline citations.

I did ref the Daily Mail (admit not the very best source at times) sometimes because they were pulling info from various places and some of it was a little different than other sources so I wanted to reflect both versions where info seemed to conflict. However, the most comprehensive source I've found so far is an AP article. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bomb-suspect-influenced-mysterious-radical There are more than 1.1 million hits on Google for """"Boston Marathon Misha"""" as I write so an argument that this person is not WELLKNOWN is debatable. 

The article is not strictly negative. It states reported bio info (granted there is limited info to report). Mostly it summarizes a real debate through the media between various family members (mainly the Maryland uncle and a former husband of a sister) who cite Misha as the driving force behind Tam's radicalization and the mother who says he was just a nice guy. The various interviews are easy to find and widely quoted, though I believe the refs were mostly to the original media sources or multiple sources.  

There is some wild speculation about this guy by the media out there. I specifically excluded any of that from the article. My goal was to write an over referenced, comprehensive, neutral, informative article that accurately pulls together the various media reports so far.  Like many articles, there is room for improvement. The article was redirected (as a sub for a deletion nomination) before anyone even had a chance to properly review it and improve it. 

BLPCRIME may not apply as no one, and certianly not the article, is accusing Misha of a crime.

The absence of a known complete name does not disqualify a person from having a Wikipedia article. Consider DB Copper and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name

Hi Petebutt and thanks for all the hard work you're putting into expanding these lists. However, you're also causing quite a bit of chaos through, I think, unfamiliarity with how Wikilinks work.

To make a long story short, whatever goes inside the double-square brackets - [[ and ]] must be the name of the actual page that you're pointing to; if not, problems can occur. 

For example, in your recent edits to the Lockheed part of the list, you removed """"Lockheed"""" from some of the entries. This means that F-4 points to the Phantom II and U-2 points to a disambiguation page. If you want the link to appear different on the screen from the actual page name, we use what's called a """"pipe""""; for example - [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] will appear as """"U-2"""" on the page, but take you to the Lockheed U-2 article (try it! - U-2).

Hi again - you're really getting the hang of things now. I'll continue to offer some unsolicited advice - if I'm bombarding you too much, please feel free to tell me to get lost! )

I took the liberty of moving your """"under construction"""" article from your userpage to User:Petebutt/Sandbox, which is the conventional spot to store such things.

A few notes from your recent contributions - these are all really formatting """"nits"""" (with perhaps the exception of the links) - please take them in a spirit of friendly encouragement and as a """"fast track"""" towards learning Wikipedia (and WikiProject Aircraft) style.

SectionsIn many articles, you'll see """"hidden"""" comments like . These have been left as reminders that if the article ever grows big enough to require splitting into sections, these are the conventional names for these sections (take a look at a major article like F-4 Phantom II as an example, and WikiProject Aircraft: Page content for the guide)
 the section will not become visible until the """""""" are removed
 in short articles, there's no advantage to using these; it's better to just leave them hidden - remember that we're trying to write encyclopedia articles in connected prose. One-sentence paragraphs (let alone sections) have little value here
 For experimental, one-off prototypes, the """"Operators"""" and """"operational history"""" sections are meaningless - just leave them out.

ContextYou removed context-giving introductions from a couple of articles. It's extremely important that articles establish context right at the beginning. There are a number of different ways that readers may come across an article; therefore the lead should establish straight away the what-where-when, and that for example, the """"Yakovlev Yak-25 was a prototype fighter aircraft built in the Soviet Union in 1947"""". Elaboration can (and should!) follow - but straight away, the reader knows what this article is about, and that this is not a car, washing machine, or something from Star Trek.

Over four hours??? Guess what I was doing during the four hours between 1:00am and 5:00am last night? Sleeping. Wikipedia is an international website with editors from all over the world; not everyone will have an opportunity to respond to a talk page comment at any given moment. People work. People study. People eat. And, yes, people sleep. Some people will edit every three hours; others will edit every three days. You cannot just say that because no one has commented in four hours a discussion is closed. I'd suggest waiting five to seven days after the conclusion of a conversation before considering it closed. 300 (film) is a very active article and there clearly are a lot of matters that are as of yet unsettled. The fact that a talk page has reached a certain size is not an automatic license to archive the page, particularly when there is unfinished business. Regarding your pending three-revert rule violation, all of your reverts to 300 (film) contribute to the rule unless you are reverting simple vandalism. That is not what you are doing; you are reverting legitimate edits, so clearly """"consensus"""" has not yet been reached. The best course of action is to go to the talk page and discuss the matter more. Perhaps you might consider Wikipedia:Mediation Committee or Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal.

 Attempt at close of old RfC 

That is, the RfC listed on Archive 4 of this talk page, """"RfC: Does the article minimize the centrality of India to the notion of caste?"""" That the discussion wasn't closed earlier is of little surprise: it is long, it is technical, and the older it gets the less appetizing it gets: such discussions are very much not like Parmigiano-Reggiano. In fact, the discussion is so long that you'll have to accept the general conclusions I think I was able to draw without my being able to point at each and every individual comment supporting it. What I, as a non-Hundi-Indian currently middle-class college professor, conclude, are the following points:
Scholarly consensus appears to be that the caste system is still of the greatest importance to Hindu India; vice versa, discussions of the caste system in secondary and tertiary scholarly sources note the centrality of Hindu India to the very concept of """"caste"""".
Scholarly and especially less scholarly discussions on the concept of caste in other societies, esp. those outside SE Asia, mostly seem to use the term in the """"broader"""" sense signaled in various places in the RfCas a convenient shorthand for """"social stratification"""" and such. I note also that the application of the term """"caste"""" to some other cultures, popular until the 1970s and perhaps after, has now come under (academic) scrutiny and criticism.
Considering those two points, I conclude that it is 
The 1 September 2012 version of the article does suffer from OR and some coatracking; the current version is much better in that respect, though far from perfect. Note, for example, the very loose use of the word """"caste"""" in this newspaper article to warrant the inclusion of Cagot. As it turns out, there are sources """"comparing"""" their segregation to that of the Indian caste system: such a comparison is perhaps valid, but does not itself warrant calling them a caste.

Allow me a few observations and suggestions.
""""Caste"""" should (and this is supported in the RfC) include extensive discussion of the situation in India.
Examples from other cultures (some of which well established and verified in the current version of the article and associated main articles) must of course be thoroughly verified; an article from The Independent cannot suffice for what is, after all, an encyclopedic article.
I believe it is imperative (and comments in the RfC and elsewhere in the talk page archives support this) to come to a clarification of terms. The current lead does some of that already, but a separate section is warranted. Etymology should be the least important part of such a section; more important is a history of the usage of the termnot to be able to list every example of its usage, but rather to sketch the attractiveness of the paradigm to scholars of various periods, an attractiveness that has by now lost some of its currency. Parts of the lead of the 1 September 2012 version point to that as well; what's important is to delineate the term and its currency. Fowler&Fowler; cites Balkin in the RfC (""""social stratification in the United States does not really match the technical definition of caste ... caste is at best an effective hyperbole"""") and it's precisely that kind of research and criticism that need to be used here.
Sourcing should continue to be scrutinizedin Caste system in India, I read """"Caste is neither unique to Hindu religion nor to India; caste systems have been observed in other parts of the world, for example, in the Muslim community of Yemen, Christian colonies of Spain, and Japan"""", with one reference possibly very outdated (1972) and another a newspaper article from the New York Times. This is an article in which Wikipedia's crowdsourcing """"hey it's in the paper let's add it"""" needs to be held in check.

In all, I believe this was an interesting discussion in which the participants are perhaps closer to consensus than they thought. It is clear that there is no consensus that the article is redundant to Caste system in India etc.; it's clear also that there is consensus that the article should be much more focused than the 1 September 2012 version was, and that India must occupy a position of great(er) importance. In various places various quantified suggestions were made; I cannot comment on those numbers. I sensed some hesitance at perhaps """"borrowing"""" material from Caste system in Indiawell, if that's where good content on the concept of caste, its history, and its usage can be found, that's where you go. Good luck.   """,0

Filter 405
I have disabled it, sorry. The trigger was blocking edits of  (e.g. ). I have only briefly looked into the coding, and apparently the filter is simply blocking wikilinking by given IPs/users, i.e., it works accidentally, simply because the vandal happens to use a certain IP range and add wikilinks. I haven't thought about a better algorithm (particularly how to detect wlinking of common terms). A spontaneous idea is to target edits that add two wikilinks into one word, like [[pea]][[cock]], i.e. just filter addition of ]][[ - this should have a nearly 100% hit rate, but might be insufficient. Cheers.   
Do note that it is intended as a replacement for a rangeblock on a pretty active range, and the vandal's actions in the past have reached a level warranting a long-term rangeblock.

Thanks?=
I am an African American currently residing outside of the States.  I just wanted to write and say """"Thanks DeeCee"""", for your work over at the Black Supremacist page.  I surfed there by accident.  I was shocked to find that Wikipedia has even chosen to include this article.  It is far too long in view of the insignificance of so-called """"Black Supremacy"""" when compared to the massive White Supremacist Movement which is once again taking the entire White World by storm.  (Are you a Black Supremacist, if you are only trying to survive in a nation that overtly practices and tolerates Racist practices such a lynching or segregation?)  Until I read our courageous comments, I was truly daunted by the sheer malevolence that appears to be at work in that article, especially the insidious denigrations of Marcus Garvey.  So many considered him to be a hero for addressing Black suffering in the Post Slavery Occident.  Yet, that article slanders him viciously, referring to him as an errand boy of the Klu Klux Klan and a friend of White Supremacists.  I have not been able to find any truth in any of these statements, so I deleted them.  So much of the material there appears to be merely conjectured or anecdotal designed to tell ugly tales about African people in general rather than focus on the purported subject at hand.  Yet, on the White Supremacist page, there are no such juicy tidbits to further incite anger and outrage.  There are no tales told period, just the bare bones concerning this virulent hate-inspired movement.  In fact, much has been left out.  The White Supremacist article could have included a number of recent and not so reccent events that would have turned any reader's stomach but the writer keeps it very cut and dry.  Not so on the Black Supremaciy page where, the author goes out of his way to assasinate the character of any Black person who remotely expresses any racial pride or hope for his people.  I guess, he is just two fingers from calling Martin Luther King a Black Supremacist, since he incited Black people to protest white brutality and segregation.

I want to complain to Wikipedia about the unhealthy tone in which the Black Supremacist page has been written.  The assaults on Rappers and other musicians such as Lauren Hill is shocking.  I have no doubt that the article is motived by racial hate.  It is so apt that you have identified the problems as systemic.  Wikipedia is a true menace in the sense that people of African descent are often assaulted but may lack the resources, time or orientations necessary to defend themselves against those who use Wikipedia to commit what amounts to racial assault.  Refutations are highly resented and a general ambiance of White supremacist aggression reigns on many pages.  I haven't read all that you've written, I imagine that you spend a lot of time, fighting the good fight.  Again thanks.  I hope you get this message.Sincerely

Asking for a link
Giving away content or tools
Widget development
Social media campaigns
Purchasing links and more….
But first, let’s start with the basic theories…

* Why Link Building Matters

Whenever any user enters a query into a search engine, the search engine needs to determine how to return the best results. How? There are two key steps:
Figure out which pages on the web are related in any way to the query
Evaluate which of the pages that relate to the query are the most important
Each link to a web page is seen as a vote for that web page.
In simple terms, if there are two pages that are equally relevant to a given search query, the page with the better inbound link profile will rank higher than the other page (being all other factors equal).
Hence, the need of Link Building!

*How Search Engines Evaluate Links

Each link to a web page is a vote for that web page.
That implies the higher the PR, the more the value of that vote. This is partially true. But, two votes may not have equal weight even if they are from same PR page.
Value of vote depends on – Relevance and Authority
Now let’s take a deeper look at these factors…

* Relevance Factor

Purpose of the linking website

"""re:    """"TigerDirect has always relied very heavily on rebate marketing and this has been true, in the least, for several years, and their failure to honor them has made them as big as they are toda.""""    That is baloney.   That statement reflects pure bias.   You can go count the number of rebates on TigerDirect.com and you'll find less there than you find on Amazon or Newegg or any of TigerDirect.com's other competitors.   Regarding the attorney general's complaint, you also have to note that in response to the complaint Tigerdirect argued that it's not true.   If you want to state that a company has used rebates in its marketing and has had public complaints about the fulfillment of those rebates then you can create a blanket statement and apply it to pretty much every computer and CE reseller in the country.

A tag has been placed on Magnus howie requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Adding abortion to the template

Basically, here are the changes: When Joe's Garage Act I was released on CD in 1987 (the same year the Box Set edition was released on vinyl), it put in the same package as Joe's Garage Acts II & III.

I don't know about the remastered vinyl box set that came out the same year, but I assume it had the original names. The only thing close to an explanation I've ever heard for any of these changes is the """"Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt"""" change. I've looked it up, and as far as I can tell it was the subject of a discussion that took place in Frank Zappa's """"Society Pages"""" fanzine, issue #3 (which was published in 1991):

Rob Samler: """"What is a Fembot in a wet t-shirt?""""
Frank Zappa: """"Do you remember the Six Million Dollar Man...?""""

Umm - I'm not exactly """"promoting"""" him.  I'm a Democrat, and I voted for Gore.  But the consensus of several users - in fact, EVERY user except you - was very clearly in favor of the quote being removed from the introduction.  The quote provides no context, is blatantly POV, not to mention terribly inaccurate and silly, considering what actually happened with the election fraud (see http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1104-36.htm) and the fact that Gore actually won anyway.  So how did he make Dubyah the president?  Yes, I'm aware that's the first thing many people think of when they see him, just as the first thing many people think of when they see Mama Cass is that she died choking on a ham sandwich.  This, like the quote, is not true at all, but merely an ill-researched fallacy.  Does this mean we should write in Cass' introduction that she is best known for having choked on a ham sandwich?  No, because it simply isn't factually based or accurate at all. Even if it was accurate, it still wouldn't be appropriate for the introduction as it provides no context. Pretend you are someone who didn't know anything about him, and you saw this quote that he """"made George W. Bush the president""""-what would that mean? Is he the magical fairy who goes around granting wishes and making people president with his magical fairy wand from Lollypopland? You need to provide context and a detailed account of what actually happened before you provide such a glib, not to mention factually inaccurate, summary. As I said before, I've reviewed Toes+umbrellas chacha's edits, and none of them appear to be vandalism, but a pretty good faith attempt at removing something which not only constitutes a huge violation of NPOV policy, but also violates the consensus as reached on this talk page months ago.  So again, I don't know what your point is about that user being banned, when the offense seems to be only the fact that they removed vandalism well over 3 times.  To me, your offenses of violation of NPOV, violating consensus when no one agrees with you, and editing other user's sigs seem a twinkle more extreme than theirs.  I invite everyone to look at the comments that Griot left on Astruc's talk page wherein he revealed his very clear bias on this issue-he accused Nader of being a """"Maoist""""-and he is clearly just using Wikipedia as his own personal coloring book to slander him in violation of NPOV policy, and in violation of an irrefutable consensus on this issue.

Count me among one of the biggest supports of Arbcom. I think they are over-worked, and generally under-appreciated. They take on the toughest situations, and try their best. That said, I'm dumbfounded at how the Tea Party case turned out, specifically (though not exclusively) the sanction against user:Collect. I had not followed that case while in progress. I knew it existed, but the first time I looked at it was after I saw the request for appeal by Collect. I decided to trace through the case, to see if I could understand how the committee reached their sanction. I traced through  my observations at  a talk page post to NW. Short version, I saw virtually nothing in the evidence, and virtually nothing in the workshop, so I was puzzled by the strong sanction. 
The response, and I quote:
You said:
I think that for the large part, the evidence and workshop phases were ignored in this case 

In some fairness, the sanction itself listed some diffs, but I find them short of compelling.

 Housewife 

You're right Dybryd, WP:BLP says nothing about how we shouldn't mention that he's gay because he doesn't want us to, the fact that he's self-identified is all that matters.  We don't do anything purely because the subject of an article wishes it.  I find it very confusing that Brannan went on that rant against Wikipedia saying he was gay, that he didn't want such attention focused upon his gay identity, in light of the new promotional video for a song on his upcoming album; """"Housewife"""".  If Brannan really didn't want a focus to be on his homosexuality, he wouldn't have singled that song out for promotion.  I wonder if he was messing around when he wrote that blog entry about Wikipedia, he's kind of known for being histri-ironic.     """,0

 Homeopathy 

The reference to the term """"Homöopathie"""" being first published in 1807 is on page 263 of the Dean article (page 9 of the pdf), although his referencing is a little convoluted - it cites an article called """"Fingerzeige auf den homöopathischen Gebrauch der Arzneien in der bisherigen Praxis"""", referring to ref. 52 which itself refers back to ref. 24 which has it published in Hufeland’s Journal, xxvi (1807), 5–43.  

I'll reword the """"Hahnemann's concept"""" section to include Hahnemann's use of the term """"doctrine of specifics"""" and reference Dudgeon.

I've noticed there's a short """"to do"""" list on the Homeopathy talk page which I might try to work on now that things have quietened down over there.  Do you know of any good but reasonably concise sources (preferably available online) for:

i) the concept of healing crisis in the context of homeopathy;
ii) the work of Constantine Hering and James Tyler Kent and how it differs from Hahnemann?

 Removed text from article 
You're right the history section needs serious work.  I have removed it from the article because, I believe, it is a lot of conjecture.  It certainly doesn't jive with what I've read on the subject, and goes contrary to information found in referenced articles, for example country dance originating in frontier towns.  I would suggest that the country dance section of the folk dance article is read carefully.  

I would also suggest that careful citing of references in this history section will make it a lot better.  What happened to the role of the """"dance master"""", and of """"recorded music""""?  These are both important aspects of the caller's history.

It's a little too hit-and-miss for my taste.   

History
The role of the dance caller or cuer came out of necessity, given the origins of folk dance in America, but also in various cultures throughout the world.

In America, you can find many examples throughout history of frontier towns (where country dance originated) having people with traditions and dance styles from all over the world.  It was customary for people, when they finished work for the day, or when the week was over, to relax and go to a community dance event.  Everyone from town came.

Having people, however, from all sorts of different cultures caused problems.  People from one culture would know a certain type of music, or certain steps; and while there was some overlap in a few cases, the different steps were very confusing to those who didn't know the dances.  Also confusing was the fact that even in the case of overlap between cultures, the steps had differing names.

Thus, the country dance caller was created out of necessity.  Rather than only the dances they knew from each caller, someone was called upon (or more often just came about in an effort to help everyone have a good time) who learned the dances and steps of everyone, and each town created their own list of dance steps.

As towns expanded, and people travelled, these new callers (named such because they called out what you were to do next in each dance) were able to learn from each other and each other's styles to the point where, modernly, there is a full Callerlab devoted to maintaining a list of proper square dance calls, integrating new calls and styles of dance, and generally supporting and promoting new ideas in square dance calling, as well as up-and-coming callers.""",0

Many of the issues pointed out here are worthy of discussion. As a work in progress like the rest of Wikipedia, this article will be improved with time. A big problem for articles about religion in China (and popular or folk religion in particular) is that this (extremely vast and varied) field of research has received little attention in the West until recent times and most of its literary heritage has not been translated in Western languages (or has been mistranslated). There are also discrepancies in the Western and Chinese understanding of what is and what is not """"religious"""". Only recently Western and Chinese scholars are cooperating for a clearer analysis of Chinese folk (or popular) religion.
Regarding the style I have used in writing this article (for example the use of many notes, quotations, and the explanation of the different names of this religion or complex of religions), it is due to the complexity of the topic itself.

There is no widely agreed-upon definition of terrorism. Let's hold off on that for now until we get a number of news organizations calling it that.  (Talk) 
It might, but it's too soon to say. We don't know the motivations of the shooter (though I can't help but wonder if it's a tea party sympathizer taking to those """"second amendment remedies"""").

There has to be more conservative categories we can use until we know all the facts. Is there a shootings in 2011 category?  - talk 

Murder is being misused.  Technically, it is a BLP violation.  Killings, yes.  Murder is a legal term.  Let's be precise.    

Murder - The unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another  Nidhiki 

My issue was more with the use of it being mass murder, since that's a bit unclear especially when the number dead isn't concretely known.  - talk 

 I went ahead and removed Category:Assassination attempts and Category:Mass murder in 2011 per the above.  - talk

I see you've reverted SPUI on this template - however, his version had support on the talk page. I can understand you're a bit grumpy with SPUI at the moment, but I'd appreciate if you'd check the talk pages before reverting. In this particular instance, SPUI's suggestion was bang on the money. CfD is not a vote, and the template formatting isn't helping with that. The Cfd template itself is often useful for situations where """"this category is rubbish, we need to rescope it or merge it into something else or just plain delete it (oh, and if you really do want to keep it, it still needs to be renamed)"""" that degenerating it into a keep vs delete thing (with all the horrid prospects of vote-counting) is not the wisest of ideas.

 Choosing an easement curve 

I'd like to be clear about:
(a) which curves are actually used in practice ...
(b) in the various railways administrations; not just North American but also others, e.g. Australian, European, Indian etc.  (This would help with NPOV.)

My main concern is with (a).  Although the article mostly discusses Euler spirals, it seems to give the impression that's the only curve used, under varying names.  However, consider this quotation (from the AREMA reference in the article):
There are several different types of mathematical spirals available for use, including the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate.  Of more common use on railways are the Searles, the Talbot and the AREMA 10-Chord spirals, which are empirical approximations of true spirals.
This reference is, of course, discussing common use on American railways; but even in this limited context, it appears there are at least three ideal mathematical spiral forms involved: """"the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate"""", along with various practical approximations to them.

The article would ideally give the history of the use and adaptation of these various spiral forms.  Doing so would provide a solid illustration of how technological innovation was both necessitated and encouraged by the Age of Rail - a valuable insight into the social impact of rail.

I'm guessing that the AREMA reference probably continues on from the quote above to give some further detail about those approximations, their inventors and their history; but it may not.  In any case, can anybody provide suitable references to help flesh out this story?

"""::Respectable guide books (in their printed versions) mostly count as reliable sources, and, interestingly, most such respectable guide books are very uncomplimentary about Gibraltar as a tourist destination. (In comparison to the lovely areas of the Spanish coast to the west of Gibraltar.) If there really are concerns about the Gibraltar government's off-hand comments about not wanting """"nasty"""" material added - which seemed quite innocent and unremarkable to me - then the concerned people should spend some time adding neutral and due weight content from guide books to some of the Gibraltar-related article. I somehow doubt there will be mass reverting of such additions, which will helpfully show that we're still getting neutral and encyclopedic content.

If all of this brings us to a point where detailed summaries of such respected guide books can be easily accessed through Wikipedia when visiting Andalucia, that would be a huge benefit to people like me. So get to it!

 Why confusion and controversy in the """"real world"""" does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic 

Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out """"the truth"""" about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.

I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors """"get it wrong"""" is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.

Instead of """"truth"""", Wikipedia aims for """"verifiability"""".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents """"THE TRUTH"""" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.

I have been trying to hit this NPOV """"sweet spot"""" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.

 
Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits. That's why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ """,0

 America's Failed Federal Criminal Justice System.

 America's Failed Federal Criminal Justice System. 

By:  Mark A. Varca, Chief Information Officer, FedCURE.

FedCURE is the world's leading advocate for America's, ever growing, federal inmate population. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to extend an invitation to each of you to join us in our efforts to reform the federal criminal justice system in the United States. Federal CURE, Incorporated, is a nonprofit organization that, inter alia, deals largely with the issues faced by federal inmates and their loved ones. 

We are working to reinstate parole; increase good time allowances;  provide for compassionate releases; restore PELL grants; and opportunities for successful reentry  into the community, for all federal offenders; and promote a system that incarcerates fewer people and provides humane conditions for those who are incarcerated or under post-incarceration supervision via parole or supervised release. Over 45,000 people were released from federal prison in the United States last year.  On this day, the United States Federal Bureau of Prisons houses 185,100+ people.  Most serving long, non parolable, sentences for non violent offenses.

Please consider, if you have not already, joining and contributing to FedCURE.  We are the world's leading experts in matters relating to federal inmates.  Collectively, five of FedCURE's 14 board members have over 50 years of in prison experiencebehind the fenceas former federal inmates.   Each holding J.D.'s, two holding LL.M's and two holding Ph. D's.  Our lifetime members include the best criminal attorneys in the United States.  .

""""Martha Stewart's incarceration has made her the DIVA of federal criminal justice reform in the United States.""""  Mrs. Stewart wrote from prison in a December 2004 letter posted on her Web site, """"I beseech you all to think about these [inmates] - to encourage the American people to ask for reforms, both in sentencing guidelines, in length of incarceration for nonviolent first-time offenders, and for those involved in drug-taking.""""  The synergies behind that have yet to unfold.  However, we can state with confidence that, when all the discussions settle on the table concluding that the federal criminal justice system in the United States is undoubtedly broken and in need of reform; and that after all of the discussion about what's wrong with the system and what can be done to fix it comes to rest, in the end, it always comes down to one important reform issue:  To reduce federal prison sentences.  In today's political environment, however, there is only one possible hope that would best accomplish this reform:  Enact federal legislation to revive our former system of parole for federal prisoners; and to provide new re-entry opportunities for people being released from prison. 

To that end, FedCURE is feverishly advocating in favor of  H.R. 3072 (former H.R. 4036, as amended) a bill to Revive the System of Parole for Federal Prisoners, that was introduced, in the 109th Congress, by the Honorable U.S. Representative, Danny K. Davis (D) of Illinois on 27 June 2005.   

Parole of federal offenders began after enactment of legislation on June 25, 1910.  Under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the United States Parole Commission retained jurisdiction over defendants who committed their offenses prior to November 1, 1987.  At the same time, the Act provided for the abolition of the Parole Commission on November 1, 1992.  The phase out of the Commission has been extended by statute several times. The status of the Commission beyond November 1, 2005 remains unresolved despite the Commission having taken over supervision of all DC offenders in addition to the remaining 4,000 Old Law offenders.  Presently, the Commission has over 100 employees and a budget of over $10 million.   H.R. 3020, introduced on 22 June 2005, seeks """"To extend the existence of the U.S. Parole Commission.

When the U. S. Sentencing Guidelines were imposed for federal defendants whose criminal activities took place subsequent to November 1, 1987, parole was eliminated.  Early release was limited to approximately 47 days of good time each year and the sentences themselves were increased appreciably.  The majority of federal inmates are non-violent low-level drug offenders with very long sentences.  Moreover, the majority of this segment of the federal inmate population is being incarcerated for the first time. Thousands of people in prison are serving life sentences for non-violent offenses without the possibility of parole.  The vast majority of these people are also first time offenders.

 Sound of jewellery 

The sound of jewellery has played an enermous part in many stories, poems, and religious literature (more details and sources to come).
Different jewellery creates different sounds, ie plastic bangles create a high pitched clink sound, while others such as baxelite produce
a """"clunck"""" sound. Knowing how a particular piece of jewellery sounds can help someone identify whether or not a piece of jewellery is fake.
Indeed people have written about the sound of """"fake gold"""", and jewel makers such as Sharon Alouf, a famous jeweler have praised the high frequency pitched noise of gold bangles(most likely real gold she is wearing). To this day, the jeweler claims, """"the sound of bangles clinking together is very soothing to me. It always reminds me of motherhood.""""Alouf is even partial to particular tones. """"Gold produces my favorite sound,"""" she says, """"the pitch is higher and clearer, which I find energizing.""""

Destructuring of the article
Ladies and gentlemen, apart from painful neutrality issue, I'm concerned with the growing deformation of the article's structure and style. I'm talking mainly about the actions of the definite national group of editors (which I could avoid naming unless it renews its usual personal attacking again).

Two weeks ago I removed the duplicating and excessicely-detailed sentences, as well as irrelevant images from """"Ukraine"""" section, and the other side seemed to agree non-images edit. Now I find new duplicating passages in the first section (although the intro looks better now). Editors who responsible for this: did you care reading section in the whole? And more, new lenghty redundant subsection on Vitebsk appeared. Not to mention the images, which litter only """"Ukraine"""" section (is this a permanent trollish attack on Ukrainian editors?).

Why doing things like that? I can understand POV-pushing intentions of pro-partisans users... But we must first of all care about innocent readers, not concerned with survival of either Russia or Ukraine. Otherwise the project would degrade, and Jimbo would run out of his budget.

Distinctively on images issue: I will put NPOV tag unless they will be removed in a week.  """,0
Your comment on your edit proves you are ignorant of Islam.,1
"""New edits - explanations and justifications ==

Considering the controversy about the definition of Druz as Arabs, we'd better of say """"Arab and Arabic speaking people that are not Jewish"""". The Druz may or may not be Arabs, but they definitely speak Arabic.
Some of the 150,000 Palestinian Arabs who became Israeli citizens in 1952 were refugees who managed to return to their homes before the borders closed. By the way, I wonder if we should write """"Palestinian and Bedouin Arabs"""", as the Bedouins often distinguish themselves from the Palestinians.
""""Occupied East Jerusalem"""" - let us do without the complicated discussion about the legal status of Jerusalem. Saying that East Jerusalem was unilaterlly annexed is quite enough in terms of supplying required information.
It is improtant to emphasize the special status of the Druze.
It is important to emphasize the special status of Jerusalemite Arabs.
The regard of Israeli Arabs as an indiginous minority is a theory or a claim. It is not a fact. It is very hard to determine which of the Arabs in Mandatory Palestine is an immigrant from other parts of the Middle East, or a descendant of such an immigrant, and which of them is actually indigenous. This way or another, the conflict between Israel and its Arab citizens cannot be said to be the mere result of a universal phenomenon of tension between indigenous people and newly established authorities. The main cause of tension is the Israeli Arab conflict.

Request for protection/Vandalism

Wow. The last few months of the history are all anonymous IPs vandalising the page (with the usual reverts). Can we semi-protect the page if it keeps happening? Also, I notice the Synthesis section that used to be here got lost in the shuffle  should I restore it?  

Hello. I have requested protection for this article and it got rejected. Can someone else try it? What do people think about the rate of vandalism of this page? I personally find it outrageous.  

Crazy, it's every day now. BTW, could folks please post warnings (as per ) on the vandal's talk pages?  

I agree with [User:Kupirijo|Kupirijo]. This page is vandalized often by people going after sports teams.  21:56, 7 May 2007

Biochemistry Vandalism
PLEASE if you are not sure about something please discuss it here. Steroids include phytosterols. Phytosterols are not derived from cholesterol otherwise all vegan people would be in deep trouble ). In general there is a tendency to write comments from a human perspective. Please remember that compounds are found throughout nature and span many living organisms. That said I removed the anonymous person's comments that all steroids come from cholesterol, who he removed my previous comments on the HMG-CoA pathway. I added lanosterol and squalene instead.  Thanks.  

 corticosteroid v. anabolic steroid 

Canof steroid hormones that are genericly refered to as """"steroids"""" by different groups (corticosteroids by doctors, anabolic by athletes), end of similarity.  The corticosteroids are actually catabolic, the opposite of anabolic. 

removed section and reasons

TABThe first “Steroid” was a product developed in the 1930’s to give much needed testostarone to people whose bodies did not produce enough on their own. It just so happens that testosterone helps build muscle at an alarming rate. Once Steroids were proven effective on animals, Germany used these steroids on soldiers in WWII. The Germans saw that their POW’s (Prisoners of War) were suffering from malnutrition, so they made the decision to treat them with steroids. The steroids helped prevent muscle loss, thus making them live longer. It wasn’t until the mid 1950’s where steroids were first used in professional sports. Many Russian and European weightlifters used these steroids to increase their game and dominate the sport of power lifting.
TABThere are many types of Steroids, but the most common of them all is anabolic-androgenic.  Most athletes take this steroid for the good effects the anabolic part brings. Anabolic means increasing body tissue (mostly muscle). So when an athlete takes the steroid their muscles increase dramatically giving them an impressive amount of strength. The only bad effect this part brings is that it can increase your muscles so dramatically; it can cause the user to become more prone to injury. The androgenic portion of the steroid is the bad part. This part is highly related to the male hormone: testosterone. This increases facial hair, baldness, nervousness, bad breath, and much more. The doctors sometimes prescribe their patients steroids because of the androgenic part. Androgenic helps synthesize testosterone, giving much needed help to patients whose bodies do not produce enough on their own. Doctors however prescribe only about 4-10 mg a day, whereas an athlete may take up to 100mg a day. Steroids are still not safe even if you use it in small doses, unless your body is lacking testosterone. Athletes need to consider the dangers of Steroids and not just the increased muscle tissue.
TABAs well as the many types of Steroids, they can also be taken a couple different ways. The most common way to take Steroids is through injection; this is when the user takes a liquid steroid out of a bottle and puts in a needle. The user then injects the needle directly in the skin, like a shot in the doctor’s office. This can be especially dangerous because many abusers do not use sterile needles. HIV and AIDS can be transmitted from a person that has the disease to a person who does not have it. The other way you take steroids is in a pill form through the mouth. This is used less then injection throughout the athletic world because they do not work as well. Injection works faster and is much more efficient then pills. Pills are chea",0

 Bridge to Teribithia 

Now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text, I've checked, and he or she is right; there is no mention of Young at IMDb, the film's page, or her own homepage. That User:Shelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that she's not Shelby Young; moreover, if she were, she shouldn't be editing the article on herself. Mel Etitis (Talk)  

I haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  

IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an """"alternate ending""""). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  

1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in """"Night at the Museum"""". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. 
2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.

3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.

4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a """"popular"""" one that has been photoshopped. If so, where is it? I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. Ispy1981 

Jiust to make clear on the last point, that I offered no such argument. Mel Etitis (Talk)  

Sorry bout that. It was early for me, and I hadn't had my coffee yet.

Thank you Will. 
Here are the three scholars' descriptions of what Rawat wanted to do as he grew older -
1. not allow others to dictate the direction and management of the movement.(Geaves)
2. manifest his own vision of development and growth. (Downton)
3. decide what direction the movement should take.(Melton)

and this desire caused

1. a deep rift in Prem Rawat’s family.(Geaves)
2. he had to encroach on his mother's territory and, given the fact that she was accustomed to having control, a fight was inevitable.(Downton)
3. a split between Maharaji and his family, ostensibly caused by his mother's inability to accept Maharaji's marriage to an American follower(Melton)

So how about """"As Rawat turned 16, his desire to decide to dictate the direction of the movement led to split with his mother.

It looked really shoddy. I tightened up the prose, condensed it into summary style.

 Deleting comments on your talk page    
  
I should point out the wikipage wikipedia:Avoiding common mistakes. This page is essentially a list of rules that others expect you to abide by. The second to last rule is relevent to talk pages. While it's not the case that you can never delete material from your user page it is not considered acceptable to do so to new comments. I wouldn't worry too much about undeleting the comments you have already deleted but I would ask respectfully that you refrain from deleting any further comments (especially those critical of yourself). If you continue to delete critical comments on this page you may find that others take offense in which case they may try to get you banned.  10:18, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)""",0

I imagine my edits will probably be reverted several times, so I may as well start this in case. Character articles describe characters, but they are not meant to hold every single plot detail relevant to the characters. Entries should have a basic description, background information if it is necessary, and plot details only if they deal with character development. Something like Doyle's development is fine to list, while random graphic novel appearances are unnecessary. Character lists also only deal with important characters.

I think you sound like a delusional, academic lesbian who wishes you had a neighborhood of your own.  I've never even denied that lesbians are found in the neighborhood.  My point is that while they have always been present, perhaps in greater numbers than elsewhere, they have had minimal impact on the neighborhood. They certainly have not been numerous enough to warrant a term like """"Dike Slope"""".  The reality is lesbianism is largely an academic phenomenon.  It doesn't surprise me in the slightest some professor would make such a claim.  But, that one class does not trump a substantial portion of my personal experience over many years.

I will no longer be vandalizing Wikipedia or its userpages.

My non constructive edits were done out of boredom, especially those  containing racial slurs. (I am not racist, in fact I am racially mixed myself)

I wanted to show President Ramsey how to market the """"New U of L"""" and Wikipedia was my penpad to this end. 

My vandalism started after a edit conflict over the Courier Journal's sports and editorial coverage, where my (what I felt were) legitment edits on the page for C-J critism were removed and I was blasted. After another C-J my account was blocked.

Manufacturable and repeatable standards
Example physical standards of the base units used in the metric system capable of being accurately manufactured (known as realisable by the BIPM), ideally with reference to naturally occurring stable physical constants or phenomena rather than to a single existing physical object or artefacts. The BIPM publish a set of instructions for how to manufacture a reference standard for each of the base units. This is known as a mise en pratique in French, the primary language of the BIPM. Where practical at the time, the definitions of the base units were developed so that a suitably equipped laboratory would be able to construct an acceptably accurate reference standard without the need to compare it with an existing physical object, which may not be available locally. In practice, such such realisation is done under the auspices of what is known as a mutual acceptance arrangement (MAA).

Please discuss.",0

 If this is of any assistance 
Here is a copy of the list I last posted over at the Juggernaut Talk page of the small part of Asgardian's past offenses that I had the energy to look up when I originally wrote it. I have also asked User:Nightscream to contribute. Feel free to add anything that you may not have known previously:

Asgardian being a proven sockpuppet user, which turns suspicious whenever various anonymous ips have reverted to his edits: 

Asgardian's block page for consistent edit-warring, before starting to simply do one revert a day or so to get away with it, regardless if this is in direct violation of consensus, like in the Dormammu case:  

Newer conflicts:  

User: J Greb noticing that Asgardian has continually written edit-summaries that have little, or nothing to do with what he's actually doing, or even flat-out contradict it, and Asgardian stating that he'll continue to do so as long as he can get away with it:  """"I've grown very, very tired of edits like this where the editor does multiple things and then puts in a partially truthful edit summary."""" Response: """"As for J Greb's concern, I've made a request to be directed to the relevant rule on Wikipedia."""" 

User: Nightscream noticing Asgardian's tendency for dishonesty, to then accuse anyone who points if out for """"incivility"""", which given that he does what he always does makes it impossible to even respond: 

Asgardian recently apparently systematically vandalising page-structures just to make a point, and various other users making a plea to finally shut him down:    

Only the most recent situation of distorting profile content and deleting multiple references regardless that the information was entirely correct, and that the entire Talk population disagrees with him, and going by my experience on other pages such as Thanos he will eventually revert everything at a time when everyone else has mostly lost interest, even if he has to wait half a year to do so:  

(This proved prophetic, as most recently User:Duae_Quartunciae [warned] him of a ban if he continued to remove valid references, and he left the pages Dormammu alone for a few weeks after this, but then returned and did exactly the same thing all over again, despite that nobody agreed with him, with my main problem being that he essentially replaced referenced exact quotes with personal opinions.)

In addition, there was this old hint that he finds this behavior funny:  """"""""insidious misrepresentation""""...heh. How old are you?""""

That said, I have been reluctant to view him as a troll, since he does seem to try doing much more useful things than simply being a neverending nuisance for everyone in this """"community"""", myself in particular, despite , but reasoning and compromises (i.e. rewrite the sentences for better structure if you wish, but keep valid references and accuracy cor",0

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio """,1

I moved the 69-72 Markham and Dixie championships from the Central B/Mid-Ontario to the Metro League, where they played.

DIXIE BEEHIVES 

(1957 - 1986)

Perhaps the first team to operate in the OHA under the Dixie name was the Dixie Staffords of the pre-Metro Junior 'B' Grouping that operated during the 1949-50 season. In 1952, the East York Rockets of the Metro grouping moved to become the Dixie Rockets. A few years later, the team changed its name to the Dixie Beehives. The Metro Junior 'B' Hockey League was a strong league and the Beehives were the league's most stable team. In 1972, a new Tier II Junior 'A' Provincial League was formed and the Dixie Beehives were one of six Metro teams to move up to the new league. The Beehives played in the league until 1986 when they ceased operations. The league managed to last only one additional season.

PATEY, Larry
Hockey
Born: March 19, 1953
Toronto, Ontario
Lary Patey played most of his young career in Mississauga, first in the Port Credit Hockey Association and later with the Metro Junior B Dixie Beehives. It was with the Beehives in March of 1971 that Patey suffered a near fatal accident during the Metro Junior B final against the Markham Waxers that Dixie would eventually go on to win in five games.

Hammered into the boards by 6- foot-6 defenceman Bob Dailey, Patsey slumped to the ice. While trying to get up, Patsey's teammate Rick Cornacchia took on Dailey in a tussle and the ensuing melee, Patey was caught in the face by a skate blade. 

From that horrific evening, Patey went on to a long and successful 12-year National Hockey League career as a centreman. After leading the Western League in scoring while with Sault Lake City Golden Eagles where captured rookie of the year honors, Patey was soon called up to the now defunct California Golden Seals. Later, Patey was traded to the St. Louis Blues in 1975-76 for Wayne Merrick and he concluded his career with New York Rangers before having to retire because of lower back injury.

A workaholic on the ice throughout his career, Patey later applied the same hard work ethic in the world of real estate and earned President's Club Honors as one of the Gundaker Better Homes and Gardens in St. Louis after only being in the business for four years.

While Patey had his most productive season offensively for California in 1974- 75 when he scored 25 goals to go along with 20 assists, it was during his stay with the Blues that the seventh-round draft choice drew the most attention for his strong two-way play.

""""St. Louis didn't care how many goals I scored- they had Red Berenson, Derek Sanderson and Gary Unger up front to do that. They wanted me to play defensively and aggressively."""" Patey combined both skills to set a St. Louis club record for most shorthanded goals in a season and was always called on to line up against the Bryan Trottiers, Bobby Clarkes and Phil Espositos of the NHL.

""""I enjoyed doing it because there was less pressure in having to score goals and I took a lot of pride in my role.""""

Living the life as a shadow, Patey did manage to score 153 goals in his 12 year professional career before retiring after the 1984-85 season.

While the league's fans didn't always notice Patey, or the fine job he did in shutting down opponents, his peers throughout the league certainly did.""",0

The USA under the Confederation may have had the same name as the modern-day USA, but it was not the modern-day USA. The USA (Confederation) and the USA (Union, or also called """"nation""""), are different entities. The argument can be made that while the USA (Confederacy) was a """"firm league of friendship"""" among a number of """"free and independent states,"""" the USA (Union) was a separate political entity that, although it replaced the USA league, was something completely different. Saying that the Articles was the first constitution of the USA, and then providing a link to the (modern-day) United States, is misleading. My point: The article as it currently stands is incorrect because it asserts that the Articles was the constitution of a union that did not yet exist, although the political body in place did have the superficial similarity of having the same name.

And the verifiable reliable sources which support my interpretation are the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.

I have confirmed that the following organizations WILL issue 'registration papers' for Shiloh Shepherds, therefor I request that they be added to the list of """"registries"""" that the Wikipedia has compiled.

ACA - American Canine Association http://www.acavet.com/  

APR- American Purebred Registry  http://www.americanpurebred.com/

APRI - American Pet Registry Inc. http://www.aprpets.org/main/index.php

ARU - Animal Registry Unlimited http://friendpages.com/cgi-bin/public/pages/cover.cgi?pageid=animalregistry

CKC - Continental Kennel Club http://www.continentalkennelclub.com/

DRA - Dog Registry of America  http://www.dogpapers.com/

FIC -  Federation of International Canines http://www.ficregistry.org/mainpage.html

INPDBA - International Progressive Dog Breeders Alliance http://ipdba.8k.com/

NAPDR - North American Purebred Dog Registry http://www.napdr.com/

UABR -  United All Breed Registry http://www.unitedregistry.com/

UKCI -  Universal Kennel Club International http://www.universalkennel.com/

WKC - World Kennel Club http://www.worldkennelclub.com/

WWKC - World Wide Kennel Club http://www.worldwidekennel.qpg.com/

All I ask is that these be included in your list of """"registries"""" that are willing to issue papers for these dogs!  I think this is only fair .. that ALL should be represented!!

However, I do request that you mention that the ISSR, Inc. (formed in 1991) was the original registry started by the Breed Founder.

"""I believe the translation of the sentence """"Gott ließ uns fallen, und so stürzen wir denn auf ihn zu."""" is possibly inaccurate because perhaps the author translated the separable verb  """"zustürzen"""" as the simple verb stürzen.

In my German-English dictionary:

Stürzen = """"to fall"""" or """"to crash""""

Zustürzen = """"rush up to""""

But if Dürrenmatt was writing in a Swiss-German dialect (which I know almost nothing about other than that German-speakers sometimes have difficulty understanding Swiss German-speakers), these words could have different meanings, and I could be completely wrong.

I think a better translation would be:

"Fruitella Edit - Not By me, 

Dear GofW, I just saw that I was supposed to have made some changes to the entry for Fruitella. Nope. One reason why I didn't, is because I have no idea what that is, and another is that I am currently banned from editing until sometime in the future.

The problem is that I only edited 2 entries - for The Russell Tribunal and Stop The War. I firmly disagree with the reasons given for reverting these 2 edits - both organisations are openly anti-Israeli (and actually quite happy to be portrayed as such). I merely pointed this out.

The bottom line is this; Nobody has complained except   and one other individual, a little truce with him and he had no problem.

Collapsible boxes in some instances are the best way to present information without cluttering the page. 
As to the superfluous images, again the opinion of one individual. The article is a general article on eating disorders. Including images of obese individuals or the ravages that having an eating disorder can have on a person serve no purpose. If the same priciples are applied across the board the article on obesity had a number of superfluous images, including the one of an overweight child on a school playground. Someone already commented on the use of that image as being inappropriate. Someone staked out a school playground to take a picture of an overweight child,it is now on more than one article on Wikipedia. How would you feel if that was YOU. Despite the fact the face is not visible she knows it is her, her friends probably do, so that's real nice being an example of an """"overweight child"""" on the internet for all the world to see. Although if someone wanted to tease her I don't think they would use a term a little less politically correct.Somehow that picture is o.k., Penfield's Homunculus, placed near a block of text describing the somatosensory cortex, not o.k., that makes no sense.

The Battle of Tulifinny 
The date is December 9, 1864, and the place is Tulifinny Creek. Citadel cadets joined with cadets from their sister academy, the Arsenal in Columbia, to form the Battalion of State Cadets. This was different from the Cadet Company. They had been ordered to protect the Tulifinny trestle of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. The mural depicts the cadets repulsing the attack.

""""Before long, firing sounded in Charlestonthe shots that were to blast in pieces this tenurial Southern existence. Grimmer and blacker for the South, the war years rolled slowly on. And on November 30, 1864, there occurred near Grahamville the battle of Honey Hill. For Beaufort District, it meant the beginning of the end. 
Many stories of this battle have been told and written. An authentic and complete account was written in 1899 by Captain Ben Williams, of Brunson, who was a participant, was then adjutant of his regiment. His articles were published in the News and Courier and in the Hampton County Guardian. 
Outnumbered five to one, a little band of South Carolina cavalry, infantry and Citadel cadets faced a Federal naval expedition which had advanced up Broad River and disembarked at Boyd’s landing (or Salvesberg, the local name). The enemy’s destination was Grahamville Depot; their real objective the destruction of the railway track according to Sherman’s orders. 
With seven guns, a well-built breastwork, and the superb strategy of Colonel Charles Jones Colcock, who commanded the Third Military District of the state, the little Confederate band inflicted on the invaders losses amounting to nearly 8oo in a few action-packed hours. Colonel Colcock was everywhere, according to other officers. He even enlisted a strong, blowing wind on his side, having his men to fire a field of broomstraw, so that the flames were hurled into the faces of the enemy at a critical moment. Reinforcements of Georgia Reserves arrived from Savannah hours later, under General Gustavus W. Smith, but the general refused to take over the actual command from one whose ability and success had proved so outstanding. Tales have been told by many elderly local people of the surrounding roads literally running with Negro blood, because more than half the Federal force was made up of Negro regiments trained at Hilton Head. """"You could walk on dead Negroes for miles,"""" they declared. Old manuscripts tell further of bodies hastily buried in trenches; of later washing rains exposing a gruesome welter of arms and legs. These bodies later received decent burial in the Federal cemetery at Beaufort. 
An interesting side light on this battle is the fact that a local Negro, Allen Orr, participated. (He was proud of his service on the Confederate side). As a teen-age boy he went into this battle in which so many of his race were slain, """"Went with a white friend to take care of the horses."""" He lived until a few years ago. At the age of 100 years-plus, he enjoyed giving a pantomime of the manner in which he dodged behind the breastwork as the bullets were flying. The breastwork is evident for all to see. A number of cannon balls have been excavated at the site.""""""",0

In English, all three can be used in a metaphorical sense to mean about the same thing. """"Expands his breast/chest/heart"""" doesn't mean much of anything.

"There was much continuity with the earlier English church (Dioceses were reorganised, and new ones created, but much of the senior clergy remained the same, abbeys were dissolved, but some were raised to the status of cathedrals, at Peterborough for instance the last abbot became the first bishop), and under Henry the church retained a largely catholic identity.  It was under Edward that a more Protestant character appeared, due to those who dominated his governemtn (edward was under age).  Of course under Mary the pendulum swung (violently) back the other way, and Elizabeth's position attemoted to reach a compromise.  To some extent that broke down under Charles I, and of course under the Commonwealtha presbyterian polity was adopted, but with the Restoration returned the bishops.  High Church and Low Church had slightly different connotations then, and what we would now recognise as Anglo-Catholicism emerged in the 19th century (along with more evangelical groups such as the Clapham Set).

Hello Ben. May I start by noting that you have not attended to a single point I have made, but merely made unfounded protestations without any factual evidence to back them; please write all sources and proof if you have a factual point to make? These reverts to the long-standing article were not my writings, they were edits back to a well-accepted compromise (a fact you surreptitiously ignore), and the main text has been in an approved state for months now. Two separate administrators are happily with its compromise from both sides, but you appear to think you can smash in here like a bull in a china store, and rearrange the whole lot based on your own religious biases and PR campaigns for the Watchtower org. As I kindly pointed out Ben, please read all the talk pages, yes all 14 of them before you do any more vandalizing, and make casual unfounded accusations. These subjects have been debated many times and a common compromise was reached months ago, which you appear clearly not interested in. Your selfishness in trying to destroy the hard work of others and their extensive debates on these matters is quite typical of many with your religious background (the blinkered view that any method is acceptable if it makes the JWs look good in the public eye). Censorship is not welcome here, especially when it has a blatant religious agenda and bias. You have failed to make a single point of valid criticism that has not been discussed at great length before (please go and read all 14 pages of talk) as you might start to understand why you are being so unreasonable and astoundingly narrow-minded. Wikipedia is here for factual information, not public relation promotions for religious sects; if you want that then go to the Watchtower's website. If you have a specific point with referenced proof and backup, then bring it here and discuss it, but please check it has not already been done before, and please don't come out with more nebulous vague accusation with no specific point or proof. If you have facts you feel are incorrect, then produce your documented proof with references, then it can be discussed here in a mature way, before any possible changes are made.

What does that even mean? not that it's wrong to be there. I'd just like an explanation. might as well use 6 and 7

James 1:6 But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.

James 1:7 For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.

James 1:8 He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.

or the whole 10 lines

1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings. 2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various temptations, 3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 4 Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. 5 But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be given to him. 6 But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed. 7 For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord. 8 He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. 9 But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position; 10 and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.

So.. it looks like double-minded in 1-8 is refering to faith and having no doubt in 1-6. But it doesn't say anything about knowing. Or is knowing without having doubt? Can you be without doubt and still say u don't know? that sounds possible """"i don't know but i don't doubt it""""

Is theism only refering to christianity? or does it not matter anyway if only christianity is right? i don't think that would be NPOV

By the way, isn't God supposed to be beyond our comprehension? and if so, how can u know what god is if it's god is beyond our comprehension? and agnosticism is probably used more to say about knowing if god exsists, but i guess knowing what is god is part of knowing ultimate reality. hmm..

I found in the 

The Bridge on the Drina by Ivo Andric, Univeristy of Chicago Press 1977

Translator's foreword by Lovett F. Edwards, page 7: Dr Ivo Andric is himself a Serb and a Bosnian

Introduction by William H. McNeil, page 3:They went to live with her parents in Visegrad on the banks of the Drina, where young Ivo grew up in an artisan family (his grandfather was a carpenter) playing on the bridge he was later to make so famous, ..., The family was Orthodox Christian, i.e. Serb;

and in the

The Nobel Prize in Literature 1961 Presentation Speech by Anders Österling, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy - As a young Serbian student, he joined the national revolutionary movement, suffered persecution, and was imprisoned in 1914 when the war broke out. 

which shall have place in his biography for knowing that the book translator Edwards and the world-renown historian McNeil were close Ivo's friends. Both biographical notes were written in the first edition of this Ivo's book in 1959 and the biographical data are coming from the very Ivo.

Anders Österling's Presentation Speech during the official ceremony 1961 in Sweden and in the Andric's presence - gives the undeniable credibility to biographical data heard in this speech. - 

As to the Clasification paragraph - it has nothing to do with biography - just a slander and disrespect of this great writer. My proposal - delete it completely. 

From the above discussion - is visible that Andric rejected idea to be seen as of Croatian lineage

When Krleza attempted to allign Ivo with Croats - Ivo responded this way

 Enes Cengic; """"Krleza post mortem"""",  I-III. Svjetlost, Sarajevo, 1990. 2. part, pages 171-172

 """" Medjutim, s tekstom o Andricu za staru Enciklopediju stvari su tekle ovako:
 Tekst je napisao Milan Bogdanovic i poslao ga meni na imprimatur, kao biva, da li ga primam  ili ne.
 Kao ni mnoge druge tekstove,  vjerovali vi sad meni ili ne ... ja tekst o Andricu nisam citao. 
 Mislio sam: Neka pise sto hoce, tako cemo to i objaviti. Ionako  je bilo iznad moje moci da tu ista 
 diram i ispravljam. Mjesec ili ne znam koliko nakon sto mi je poslao tekst, primim od Milana pismo 
 u kojem mi kaze da je kopiju teksta dao Ivi Andricu na uvid te da on moli da budem ljubazan i da u 
 tekstu nesto izmijenim, a to je:

 Ivo Andric, rodjen u Travniku 10.10.1892. godine, hrvatskog porijekla, zavrsio skole itd.... Moli 
 me da brisem da je hrvatskog porijekla. Na to odgovaram Bogdanovicu (oprostite sto citiram):
     
 Dragi moj Milane,

 Pozdravi Ivu Andrica u moje ime, veoma srdacno,i poruci mu, ako mozes, da mu ja jebem hrvatsku
 majku, brisat cu da je hrvatskog  porijekla."""" 

Shortly, Milan Bogdanovic wrote a text of Andric's biography, presented a copy of this text to Andric. Andric asked Bogdanovic to remove the note saying that he (Ivo) was a man of Croatian lineage.

TO: KMH03 AND MARK

I am not slipping.  I have taken responsibility for my actions said I should not have created the bio of duncharris.  I shouldn't have done this.  Two wrongs do not make a right.

I also realize that mark is right I should use the term non-BSF.  

Thirdly, I am very aware via the creationism article that it is the minority view people who are not respected.  Are they given a chance to present info or is the article overrun by the consensus contrary to the minority view article policy?  I think we know the answer to this question.  But Wikipedia doesn't really care about respecting minority view articles in many cases.  Now I realize that some want to take a cookie cutter approach and let the consensus view dominate, overrun and even trample minority view articles.  This is not Wikipedia policy though.  

Now you can say I am unreasonable but it is simply not true.  

Now I saw Mark's """"assuming that Wikipedia doesn't work"""" comment.  I do think it is fair to ask if the creationism article is working.  Is it working?  Is there much civility like some (not many) internet creation-evolution forums I have seen?  No there isn't civility. It is a failure.  I believe Wikipedia fails in issues like creationism.   I think it is a failure due to mismanagement or due to premeditation.   But I believe it is a failure.  I know it is not blasphemy to say Wikipedia fails in issues like this.  Minority view people are often not respected at Wikipedia even in minority view articles.  

Now why was the Conservative Christianity repeatedly changed to Christian right?  Is it because of magnaninimous generosity of a person in the non-BSF camp? No it wasn't.   

Perhaps in the future articles like creationism will have the minority view truly aired and done in accordance with the current Wikipedia rules.  But I think this is unrealistic at this time as I see no commitment at this time.""",0

 My Conrtibutions to Shady Records 

So I've been asked to consult this page by JrPut or idk his name; but anyway:

The Shady Producers/DJ's list should be updated.
I have valid links for Mr. Porter, Alchemist, Rikanatti, and Luis Resto. The following are all Reliable links, and even though Aftermath Ent. Blog is a blog, we have used it as multible sources on additional articles, and we have also used MTV News as a reliable source, and that in itself is a blog.
 Alchemist 
Luis Resto
Rikanatti
Eminem also acts as a producer for the label, and since he is the founder, CEO, and signed to the label as its main artist, I would presume that linking references for him as a producer is frivalous and uneeded. 

Now, The Bass Brothers and Eminem have ended their working relationship. We have multible sources for this including when Em purchased his new studio, and F.B.T sued Interscope/Aftermath.

However, with that said, we have no additional proof that DJ Head has ended his working relationship with EM. We have no source saying that he has, and unless you supply one, we're going to be leaving him in the active section. Just because a producer didn't release any tracks for the label in a while does not constitute their absence from the label.

So Please, Let me re-add Alchemist, Eminem, Mr. Porter, Luis Resto, Rikanatti, and DJ Head to the production list, and let us move on with our lives. No need to keep pricking this crap in the butt.

Well I just finished a good bit of editing.  I haven't had a chance to go through and do all the tagging and referencing yet since work calls but I am extremely confident in the scientific factual basis of everything stated in here.

Also, not sure how to exactly do that as it all can be found in numerous scientific journals, databases, etc. but is so conveniently placed all in that one book.

The only thing I am unsure about as I have no experience with is Molecular Tagging Velocimetry.  To put it simply, I would like to keep technique defects in the summaries but I don't know what this one's is.  To put is bluntly, the description as it is now is too good to be true.  I know it has defects and problems, I don't know what they are.  The fact is the technique was developed in 97ish and is not in widespread use.  If the description were accurate, everyone would use it.  I have met or heard of not one person using it, which means there is some big flaw in the technique that if someone can find, be my guest to add it.

Everything else, please post on discussion page before editing critical information as I am positive what I have said can be completely defended but am open to solid arguments.  I won't be pigheaded about it.

Consensus Can Change
A small group of editors can reach a consensual decision, but when the article gains wider attention, others may then disagree. The original group should not block further change on grounds that they already have made a decision.
...
Wikipedia's decisions are ever-changing, because new people visit every day, and through new information and new ideas, we may gain insights we did not have previously. It is important that there is a way to challenge past decisions, however these decisions were reached. Decisions should therefore practically never be """"binding"""" in the sense that the decision cannot be taken back.
(Emphasis added)

Also see the flowchart at that page, particularly the first two boxes. I came across the article that was in a previous consensus, and made a change. That should not, no, can not be considered vandalism.  (talk|Contribs)

Furthermore, I'm not actually convinced consensus has been reached here, with regard to the port/spinoff/version/other-term debate. From what I can tell by going through all the comments here,  strongly believes that """"spinoff"""" is the only acceptable term;  """"isn't sure"""" but believes """"port"""" is definitely not the right term, and leans slightly toward """"other versions""""; , , and at least one unsigned comment all believe that """"spinoff"""" is not appropriate and that """"version"""" should be chosen as, while less specific, is not inaccurate by any interpretation;  supports """"spinoff"""" but feels there might be some other, better term nobody has thought of;  believes that a variety of terms should be used;  votes for """"spinoff.""""

So out of eight contributors, we have one very strong supporter of """"spinoff"""", two more moderate supporters of """"spinoff"""", three supporters of """"version"""" (and one """"slight support"""") and one supporter of """"all of the above.""""

So I have two questions,
Have I summarized everyone's position accurately?
Is there really a consensus here? (I don't think there is, yet)

 transjordan, western palestine 

Hello Tewfik,  Here is how the text was before:
 Between July 1922 and 1948, the term Palestine referred to the British Mandate of Palestine. After the seperation of Transjordan, the term referred to Western Palestine,
First there is a contradiction, since the first sentence says that Palestine meant the full area of the Mandate (which included Transjordan) up to 1948 while the second says that it only meant the west part after the separation of Transjordan.  Second, the separation of Transjordan preceded the coming-into-legal-existence of the Mandate, so the time sequence is wrong.  Third, it seems confusing to say in effect """"Palestine meant Western Palestine"""" as if there is also another Palestine that isn't Palestine.  The facts as I understand them is that before the Mandate came into effect """"Palestine"""" was only informally defined, then as soon as the Mandate came into effect the British administration began to use Palestine to refer to the left bit and Transjordan to refer to the right bit.  talk """,0

I agree with you that Mansfield probably wouldn't object to the label. He's willing to write a book about manliness, after all! ) But I don't think I'm being oversensitive. I've seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the Wikipedia to stigmatize various Bush administration officials, and it often involves linking together Leo Strauss, neoconservatism, and the War in Iraq. At one time, I thought the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles """"publicly identify with the belief in question"""" (at least I thought it did although I can't find the relevant passage now) and I assumed that's why the comment in the article said """"Mansfield has self identified as a Straussian."""" So when I downloaded the interview and it turned out that it did not substantiate the claim, I changed the language without changing the substance. There are so many conspiracy theories out there about Leo Strauss and the War in Iraq (see G-hits for the search terms [""""Leo Strauss"""" War Iraq]) that I tend to be vigilant with notable students of Leo Strauss, since the word """"Straussian"""" has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively. Is there a reason you feel strongly about using the word """"Straussian""""? I don't think being a Straussian is anything to be ashamed of, but I don't like to see the Wikipedia being used for POV pushing by people who misunderstand Strauss. Thank you for the civil reply.

Regarding the Jehovah's Witnesses material in general, part of the problem is getting independent reliable sources. We really can't treat sources published by the JWs as equal to independent publishers. For this sort of thing, I think the best ways to proceed would be to file a request for comment as per WP:RFC, maybe contacting any editors dealing with religion or Christianity articles in general, possibly on the talk pages of the relevant projects, or maybe leaving a message on the ethnic and religious conflicts noticeboard at WP:ECCN.

 Articles for creation/Miriam Battista 

Hi Arctic Kangaroo,

I'm totally puzzled by the reasons you gave for rejecting this article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation:/Miriam Battista. Miriam Battista is definitely """" 'worthy of notice' – that is, 'significant, interesting, or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded'."""" It's true that her moment of national fame was short, but it was intense, and she continued to be noticed in the press as an adult actress. Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday. For comparison, please look at the article for Gladys Hulette. I certainly think that Battista rises to at least the same level of notability.

As far as verifiable references are concerned, I truly thought I had over-referenced if anything! There are references to Charles Donald Fox's book Famous Film Folk, Photoplay, Variety, The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Internet Broadway Database, and Internet Movie Database - are these not considered reliable, verifiable sources? If the problem is that I used too many references to privately held materials, I apologize for that, but I thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening. I guess that raises a basic question for me: would Wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted, even if it sheds light on the subject? If the answer is """"Yes,"""" I'm afraid that Wikipedia is missing out on a gold mine of material.

I had been considering trying to get in touch with Wikipedia editors who are working on WikiProject Biography, as well as those involved in WikiProject Film before submitting this article for review, but as a newbie I wasn't sure how to do that. Now that the article has been rejected, I would very much like to get feedback directly from anyone involved in those two projects, as well as more feedback from you.

 stradbroke galleon etc 

Hallo Hesperian
Just thought I should send you a copy of my comments on the end of your little witch hunt. Yes you won, bully for you, I hope it makes you feel like a big man. I look forward to when I bump into you in the flesh so we can sort this out the old fashioned way; face to face. that will be fun!!!

hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by """"mainstream"""" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the """"mainstream"""" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails. Gregjay (talk)

"""
Rather than have Folken once again try to """"game the system"""" and then accuse me of being domineering when I try to revert his mistakes, who else here honestly prefers what he did over what was here before?  
1-it is not """"Original Research"""" it is clarifying what was a confusing point
2-I don't care if I've """"hurt your feelings"""", but...yes, the explanation you substituted wasn't proper English and just said """"one quarter German and Japanese"""" etc.....if I don't like it I should write it better? Yikes.  Folken I'm not going to help you in defacing an article
3-once again, you're doing surprisingly little """"actual work"""" but simply quoting rules and """"gaming the system"""" without contributing much of any real value
4-Folken, I'm not going to hand you a crown for quoting rules out of context for your own benefit, nor am I taking such threats seriously.  You would use the letter of the law to destroy the spirit of the law.  
5-Folken, how many times can I say this?  I'll be more direct:  you are not an Administrator, and have no real authority or """"sticking power"""" to maintain a revert.  I'm going to revert your awful changes, and let me guess; you're going to revert them back and claim """"revert war""""?  Yikes.    

I am not """"gaming the system"""". Please explain what you mean by that instead of throwing random bad faith accusation. You cannot revert """"mistakes"""" as I haven't done any, contrary to you. Or again, please prove what mistakes I would have committed, instead of blindly reverting and justifying your actions with unsubstanciated and gratuitous accusations.

1) No, making things up about the never-mentionned nationality or appearance of never-seen characters, or about the supposed lives of characters prior to the series (the dual-citizenship) that are never mentionned, is original research. There is no need of """"clarifying"""" with OR a point that is self-explanatory.

2) Again, your words are not the word of God. You can use all the excuses you want, like """"improper english"""", it still won't work as you are unable to prove anything you're saying. And yes, you are going to rewrite instead of remove. Otherwise, it means your """"proper english"""" is just an unsubstanciated pretext. If you refuse to reword, then it means there's nothing to reword and that it's already proper english.
Your bad faith accusation of """"defacing"""" are considered as a personal attack. You have now been warned.

3) """"Actual work"""" includes getting rid of unsuitable edits like yours. And yes, quoting rule is an important thing in WP as rules define how contributors must work on WP. So yes, correcting the edits of users like you who don't give a damn about the rules and make unsuitable edits is a huge """"actual"""" work. Also, you still fail to explain what """"gaming the system"""" means...Don't throw random accusations.

4) """"Quoting rules out of context"""" seems to be your favorite attack. But please explain how what I said would be """"out of context"""". You're quick in accusing and insulting, not in actually proving your point...And yes, I'm serious.

5) I'll be clear, VVVVV, you are not an Administrator, and have no real authority or """"sticking power"""" to maintain a revert. The thing is, you're not going to revert anything, unless you've forgotten your little speech about """"consensus"""" and """"community effort""""...I have not see you discussing anything about content or asking anyone's opinion. Sure, you've stated all the hatred you have for me, but it doesn't count as consensus discussion.

So, to sum it up, you accuse me of """"being an admin"""" because I oppose to your edits, but you don't have any problem with mass reverting without any justification ? enough of this.  

Cooler heads prevailing:  yes, I have indeed not changed your reversion, and I will wait for what everyone else has to say.  (I didn't mean that last part about """"what if I change it back?"""" literally..nevermind).  but on to point 2:  specifically, your profile says that English is not your primary language, and you added in a sentence that didn't make sense; leading me to suspect that you are honestly mistaken.  Not in grammar or something, I mean it was confusing.  Why should I help you make a reversion I disagree with in the first place?  And if it's because you're quoting a literal translation of a Red Cross Book excerpt....Folken you honestly know that the literal translation is choppy and needs to be smoothed out.  These aren't """"my"""" edits Folken: the article as it exi",0

Hi.  I'm , editor-in-chief of the Wikipedia Signpost.  We're doing candidate profiles for the Board elections.  We publish in a matter of hours, so I hope you can answer them before press time.  The questions we'd like you to answer are below.  Talk to  if you have any questions; he'll be covering the elections this year.  Thanks,   

Hello!

The Wikipedia Signpost, a community-newspaper in the English Wikipedia, is covering the Board of Trustees elections and will be featuring each of the candidates in next week's issue. As such, we would appreciate it if you would take some time to answer a few interview questions. Each candidate will be asked the same questions; by no means, though, feel obligated to answer any (or even) all of them, though we would greatly appreciate it if you did.

Some of the questions may be a bit redundant to the candidate information you have filled out already. This is both for convenience and for giving you the opportunity to expand on some of them a bit. However, we ask that you keep all responses brief, limiting them to no more than one or two paragraphs each.

You may leave replies to my English Wikipedia talk page, or on my meta talk page.

As always, the Signpost reserves the right to re-distribute the questions and replies, shorten any responses if necessary, and take any other editorial action deemed appropriate.

Actually if you translate the data from the french government it states,
Greek Community in France:15 000 (9th rank in the World), now the www.diplomatie.gouv.fr is source on many wiki pages in terms of the ethnic groups. Just beacuase you do not like the number does not mean it is wrong.

The Number of Greeks in italy is not 30,000 but rather 6831 as is stated in the official government figures.

Another reversion! the swedish census counted 10,749 but once again you have inflated the figures to 14,000 for the foreign ministry figures!

 Inclusion of retraction by """"The Hindu"""" 

This article was the subject of a """"Mediation"""" proceeding between 
(a) """"India Against Corruption"""" organisation and (b) Wikipedia """"community"""" represented by User:Sitush at . 

The core issues were:
(a) Whether the appellations """"Team Anna"""" and """"India Against Corruption"""" unambiguously refer to the same entity or not
 (b) Whether defamatory / disparaging statements emanating from misuse of the India Against Corruption's title(s) by third parties should be associated with the actual India Against Corruption movement in Wikipedia's article(s), or if these should be taken to articles on Anna Hazare, Team Anna, Jantantra Morcha etc. ?

Midway through the mediation, Sitush dropped out when he couldn't justify his edits. These content issues accordingly stand automatically decided in IAC's favour. 

Despite the decision, the article content is unchanged and the defamatory/disparaging statement remain. On 27.March.2014 the venerable newspaper """"The Hindu"""" published a retraction (by means of a clarification) of their story implying that Genl. V.K.Singh and Mr. Anna Hazare were a part of India Against Corruption.

Accordingly, the issues for discussion are proposed as follows:

A) Is the published retraction by """"The Hindu"""" worthy of prominent inclusion in this article with the following text, or suchlike

Public Notice

Sarbajit Roy National Convenor of India Against Corruption has issued public notices and clarified """"that persons like Gen (Retd.) V.K.Singh were never associated with India Against Corruption and neither was Mr. Anna Hazare a part of it. Referring to them in the context of IAC is misleading especially in context of political activity"""".

B) Should the above information also be prominently included in the article LEDE so that casual internet readers are not confused.

C) Should all content about """"Team Anna"""" be deleted or taken back to the """"Team Anna"""" article which was unilaterally merged here on 25 Nov. 2013 without notice or discussion.   """,0

"You know what, since the last exchange Oakster has clarified a source on the page, and he has also reverted you. Make the argument with him, or take it to the project page. 
The sources clearly show the following; The Triple Crown was defined with Pedro Morales WWF title, WWF IC, WWF Tag. Then HBK expanded it to GSC, to include the Euro. Then Kurt Angle expanded it to include the SD Tag titles. Then HBK and HHH expanded it to include the WHC. So Tier 1 (WHC, WWE) Tier 2 (TT and SD TT) Tier 3 (IC not US) and Tier 4 (Euro). Then Kane expanded it to include HC on Tier 4. If anyone has any combination of those seven titles then they are a Grand Slam Champion. Even if tomorrow WWE.com were to announce the TCC and GSC never happened it would not change a thing. 
The point about Benoit is that WWE.com is not 100% reliable. They do change their minds (did the Rockers ever beat the Hart Foundation, no for about a decade then yes once Bret Hart left and they rewrote history). AT the moment the WWE do not acknowledge the existence of the 2004 RR winner, so does this mean we erase it from Benoit's article? No. The expanded definition for the GSC and TCC still stand, and as HBK never even wrestled for WWF/WWE while the HC title was active I have no idea why his bio would ever talk about the HC title. (He was retired from March 1998 to SummerSlam 2002 the exact length of time the HC title was active.)

"What's that Oil for again? ==

It says the main reason for using oil in old large capacitors and transformers is because of the heat generated. Funny, I thought it was used mainly as an insulating medium and dielectric. 

OK, its for cooling as well! 

But not mainly for cooling in capacitors as they shouldnt get very hot (unless thers a lot of ripple current and a high ESR). So I intend to correct this statement. 

Ive posted a dispute tag in this area, because I dont believe in general that oil is used for capacitor cooling.
Quote from manufacturer literature:

'#  Why are GAEP high voltage capacitors oil-filled?
 
Highly insulating oil is used to suppress partial discharges (corona), increase the dielectric strength, and increase the effective permittivity (dielectric constant) of the capacitor dielectric. Oil-filled film capacitors have high energy density in comparison with other types of capacitors used at high voltage, such as ceramic capacitors. Different types of oils are used with different types of capacitor dielectric and electrode designs.

 If a photo shows that the post office is itself labelled """"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE"""" on its exterior, then I would concede, would generally agree it could be renamed to that, unless there is more weight of sources calling it something different.  Pubdog and/or BD2412, could you separate off those into one requested move discussion, using the multi-move requested move option?

 Maybe some other concern here can be addressed simply.  Specifically, I don't see any problem with there being double redirects for existing articles.  If there's a redirect to an existing individual post office article, and the article is moved, that does indeed set up a double redirect (a redirect to a redirect to the article).  But, bots come by and fix those automatically, within a day or so.  Nothing needs to be done; this is not an issue to worry about.  If a name change is agreed to, then just moving the article suffices.  And then because of dab style rules, the name shown in the dab page could/should be updated to show the actual article name.  The county NRHP list-article need not be changed, it can still show the NRHP-official name and reach the article by a redirect (perhaps temporarily by a double redirect but a bot will make it a single redirect very soon).  Pubdog does that address your concern?

 More complicated are cases where there is no article, and the topic is listed as a redlink in this dab page plus in a NRHP county/city/state list-article plus possibly also in a local town article.  Then to implement a change requires finding and changing all of those to point directly to the new preferred name.  You can't set up a redirect to a non-existant article; it will be deleted promptly.  In these cases i would prefer for a stub NRHP article to be created immediately as that is easier and allows for verification that all the related pages link to the right article.  BD2412, will you please agree that we can do that or comment otherwise, rather than proceeding some other way, in cases where a change of name for a non-existent article is eventually agreed upon?

"Who is minding the minder?  Climategate and Wikipedia == 
http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/climategate_how_the_cabal_controlled_wikipedia

One person in the nine-member Realclimate.org team — U.K. scientist and Green Party activist William Connolley — would take on particularly crucial duties.

Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.

All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.

 You People... 
...Are hoping, begging and wishing for previlages, respect a title that you did not earn, go by on your own and are not deserving of.  You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.

Once the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.

If you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.

All of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask """"if they can be white, then why should I not be?""""  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  

Sadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.

I still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.

Also, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning """"your type of whites as opposed to my type"""" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.",0

 Response to Gnangarra and a suggestion for a compromise 
Introduction:Thanks Gnangarra for your comments. Everyone interprets policies differently and this talk page is no exception to that. There are two policies widely debated here, which are WP:BLP and WP:UNDUE. I am summarising opinions of the editors involved in this discussion based on the current talk page, I did not include opinions from BLP notice board and individual members talk pages. If I may have made mistakes (unintentional) in the summarisation, please feel free to remind me and I will correct. Now, while Gnangarra, Pete (Skyring), Suturz and Yeti Hunter think it is WP:BLP violation, MickMacNee, Merbabu, Orderinchaos, Peter Ballard, chaser, Lester, Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont. Gnagarra and Orderinchaos believe it violates WP:UNDUE MickMacNee, Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont.

Quote from WP:BLP

My interpretation:The reason why Gnangarra thinks it violates BLP is because of the availability of only one reliable source. As far as I understand, reliable sources in plural do not mean that it needs more than one reliable source. Even if a strict requirement for multiple sources need to be strictly followed as asserted by Gnangarra, we have more than one instance when Howard was accused of war crimes as noted in the begining of this talk page, including the head of a state. Please remember the key word here is war crime allegations not crimes. Due to these reasons, I personally think that this does not violate BLP (as with many others).

Clarify you are taking my comments out of context, you ask specifically what policies was I quoting for opposing the text. It was the lack of multiple independent sources, ie one reliable source the ABC article, though still questionable as its lacking specific details. In this BLP is clear poorly source contentious material should be removed. garra 

Quote from WP:UNDUE
 and 

My interpretation:
I guess the first quote deals with two different views. An example can be that one view being that the world is round and one being world is flat. In our current dispute, I am not sure what we are comparing. Are we comparing reports that he was alleged of war crimes and not alleged of war crimes (if such reports exists which contradict the ABC news reports) or are we comparing that he was alleged of war crimes and he never commited war crimes. It is hard to make the distinction here.

The second quote says that minority view should not be represented at all except in articles devoted to those views. The content in dispute may fail inclusion as per WP:UNDUE because the belief that he commited war crimes are held by a small n",0
Why you did not vote to keep those articles? Now you created another strange SPI. Try to be a good editor like the greeneditor 217.42.231.23,0

If I am here to put you or your culture down, or to discredit India, why in the first place would I have stuck up for you. I had not intentions in mind when I did that. It just ticked me off when Kenneth sent you that messed up message. Just like, for example, a few years ago, when a Punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime. I was outraged...

I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam.

Well, I'm sorry, but I don't have those links that you desire. Yes, this article is very POV based, in favour of vangard propaganda sociology. Unfortunately, due to the tyrannical trends of namby pamby liberalism (Labour UK, for example), not much genuine research can be done in the subject, because it's quite politically incorrect these days. For example, when a university professor says that on average Black people score lower in IQ tests than white people, said professor gets voted out of tenure 600 to 1. So it's not good practice for libertarian capitalists to bother trying to counter argue against all this namby pamby left wing crap. Labour UK is a twisted experiment, which, although capitalist and ostensibly right wing, has introduced very bizarre left wing projects in to the political playing field: such as, teaching young children about homosexuality in schools, trying to make gay hate a crime like race hate, trying to make condemnation of monotheistic religions a crime, with use of the truth distorting term 'incitement to religious hatred' etc. We are on the losing side, those of us who love truth.

Kibo is the nickname, username and e-mail address (kibo@world.std.com or kibo@kibo.com) of James Parry (b.

His exploits have gleaned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the joke pseudo-religion kibology, centered on the newsgroup alt.religion.kibology. 

James Parry grew up and lived in Schenectady, New York before moving to Boston, Massachusetts about 1990, where he lives today. He initially was a Computer Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, but when he moved to Boston attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.

Many assume his nickname is derived from the acronym KIBO, although Parry himself has repeatedly denied this.  Another rumor has it being short for King Body, a pseudonym he very briefly used on computer forums as a freshman at RPI in the mid-1980's.

 2008 BATTLE of KODORI 

Abkhaz separatists strike disputed Georgia gorge

Posted 11 hours 29 minutes ago

Abkhazia has said it has launched an operation to drive Georgia out of a disputed gorge, possibly opening a """"second front"""" in Tbilisi's battle to retain fractious breakaway regions.

The separatist foreign minister Sergei Shamba said Abkhazian artillery and warplanes struck Georgian forces in Kodori, a narrow gorge which cuts deep into the Abkhazian territory and is an ideal route for any invasion in the region.

The attack came less than 48 hours after Georgia sent troops to retake the breakaway province of South Ossetia, triggering an invasion of Russian forces dispatched to restore the status quo.

""""Abkhazian forces, in response to the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia, have started a military operation the Kodori gorge to clear it from illegal Georgian troops,"""" Mr Shamba told Reuters.

Mr Shamba said at midday (local time) Abkhaz warplanes launched airstrikes at the Tbilisi-controlled upper part of the Gorge and artillery was pounding the area.

""""Today was only the initial part of the operation by heavy artillery supported by aviation,"""" Mr Shamba said.

Georgians denied an all-out Abkhaz attack and said they were ready to face down any aggression.""",0

Hi Red - When you get a chance, take a look at the Charles E. Bassett article. I've addressed just about all of the suggestions that you have made - at least up to this point. It may require further tweaking, here and there, but I think you'll find my latest version very much closer to what you hand in mind. While I have your attention  I had an idea that you might be able to assist with - since your technical chops are undoubtedly better than mine. In short - Is it possible to move the """"Dodge City Peace Commission"""" photo from its current location, blow it up to a larger size, and place that enlarged photo so that it is placed in what is currently a large blank space next to the Table of Contents? I think it would make a far more attractive page. I probably should mention that, prior to turning to writing full-time, I worked for several years as a corporate art director - who specialized in page layouts. Let me know what you think about the idea. Also let me know if there are any remaining issues with the Bassett article that you think should be addressed. I'm sure we can work together.   """,0

 Abortion titles mediation 

I'll tell you right now, if we don't see significantly more response, your idea, regardless of its merits, isn't going anywhere.  A way must be found to increase participation.   
There's no way to force someone to participate, mediation in itself is voluntary. It might be a good idea to send another round of notifications, but this time, with wording that encourages them to add their opinion eg """"A proposal has been made to rename the two abortion articles to completely new names"""". The idea, which is located at Link, is currently open for opinions. Your thoughts on the matter would be appreciated"""" or something like that anyway. That should hopefully kick the discussion up a gear.  The clock is ticking.... 
I think giving some additional exposure to that discussion is a good idea. But personally I think the matter is likely to have been settled which is why I haven't made any further points. Unless there is a big change in opinion after 30 days you should just move the articles to their new titles.    
The issue is mentioned on the abortion-rights talk page, but notifying involved parties (as listed on the mediation talk page) might be a wise move to take.  The clock is ticking.... 
I did that as soon as that list was made.    
Sure, but it might be wise to post them a reminder like the one I recommended.  The clock is ticking.... 
Fair enough.

 Questions about a certain [reversion] edit   

I have some questions about this edit. 

I did not remove the character string that [supposedly] is the title.  That is, the string that is the title according to the """"edit comment"""" which says: """"um, no, the title is the line above that"""".] 

On the other hand, this edit (see above) did remove the character string that (IMHO) was a better title.  (That is, the string that I thought was better, as [all or part of] a """"title"""" for the web page with the URL of http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon;_id=128944 .) 

I am not immediately ready to """"insist"""" that leaving in both of those two character strings is the best choice.  (However, if you have any comments about that """"idea"""", I am willing to listen.)  

I am prepared to try to reach some consensus.  Is there anything we can do to explore (or discuss) (or, explain to each other) the goals that are [perhaps] to be achieved by choosing well, [and carefully] which character string to use as the """"title""""?   (or, maybe that should say, << the goals that are """"more nearly"""" to be achieved >> by doing so) (- ? -). 

Would it benefit anyone (perhaps in pursuing the above mentioned goals?) if one of us were to explore (or discuss) (or, explain) the reasons why the use of the character stringSabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 for the """"title"""", would be better? 

Do we both understand (thoroughly and well) what each word of that """"title"""" means, and what its role is, in doing whatever things a title is supposed to be helpful for?  (such as, describing the """"topic"""" of a certain web page, and informing the reader a little bit, what a certain web page is """"about"""" - ? - ) 

Do we both (or, do any of us) think that this """"title""""Sabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 comes closer to describing the """"topic"""" of the web page, or otherwise (in some sense) doing thoroughly and well those things that a title is [/slash, """"should"""" be] helpful for? 

Have both of us [sufficiently] considered the question of what the web page with the URL of (value of the """"url"""" field) is about?  IMHO, it comes pretty close to being about """"Palmetto"""".  I could be wrong... 

I hope this does not sound [too] negative.  I hope that there is still a chance that one of us can wake up and learn something, that is not already known (at least, something that we don't both already know).  So, maybe there is hope for a happy, win-win outcome, that will be the best for all concerned.  (It would even be fine with me, if [after reaching some consensus successfully] we were to nuke this whole section, if [e.g.] we both wanted to delete it before it got in to any """"archive"""" files.) """"No harm / no foul.""""  (getting in to """"history"""" logs,  or, """"remaining"""" in them  might be a different matter.) 

You are welcome (btw) to answer some questions that I did not [know to] ask.  (""""if any"""").  

The kindness of a response (and/OR an edit that restores the word """"Palmetto"""") would be appreciated.  Thank you.    """,0

"This is why I support Natalya's first option, in particular regard to Abtract and Collectonian;The parties may not edit, at all, any page that the other party has been involved in editing recently...with perhaps 50 edits/two weeks being the definition. It stops them coming into contact. If Abtract and Sesshomaru want to work informally to Abtracts formula (and Collectonian notes Abtracts areas of interests), then it simply means they don't report each other. The original restriction remains, with Natalya's new wording, so that any future disagreement can be resolved back to those principles (it may avoid a party trying to redefine what the informal agreement means). Also, I don't see any reason for a time limit - if it works it stays.

"MSU Interview 

Dear Woohookitty,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

 Up to your old tricks I see 

Thankfully I have not had the displeasure or the need to smell your odious stench on this site for a while as thankfully wikipedia is large enough to avoid contemptible creatures like you.

However I notice we have crossed swords again with you crying out your age old mantra - like the fucktard you are - it's """"unsourced"""". Well done, fucking well done, you are so pig-shit thick and lazy rather than 1. do a little bit of work and find some sources yourself, you just delete stuff because it takes less effort, or 2. assume good faith. Most people don't make stuff up that they add. If you had one iota of sense in that pig-shit brain of yours, you would at least do a quick internet search to check the facts before having a WP:OWN fap and then deleting anything that you like. 

Personally I think, and I have said this before, you make absolutely no positive contributions to this site. Just looking at your edit log clearly shows you generate nothing or even bother to write something = er this is an encyclopedia. If you had your way, it would be whittled down to nothing. You have got talent or knowledge except self-importance because it's easier to be a fucking Rules Lawyer than an editor. 

I have nothing but the utter contempt for you because you cannot even do the most simplest of things and look up something. If Wikipedia is measured by the likes of you, then it's stands by the lowest common denominator: ignorance. Your application of sourcing is so fucked up and arbitrary it's laughable. Are you the sort asshole who needs to see it on the news to figure out the Pope's a catholic? etc After seeing what you have been up to butchering articles like a retard with a paper cutter, I pray to all things dark and evil that you will eventually fuck with one of this site's even worse self-important cunts. Then when you suffer massive butthurt you'll quit and realise it was also fucking pointless being such a grandstanding bastard.""",1
"Apology 

A message from my talk page:
I can see now. I was placing my personal feelings on a golden pedestal and making them the driver of my outbursts. Hell, i gnored the note of civility on the top of this very talk page. I know my actions were unwarranted, uncalled for and extremely immature. Lashing out won'y solve anything. This could be the insomnia talking, but i can see bright as day i'm in the wrong. And i regret my actions.

I apology, Hodson, for my truly unacceptable conduct. I allowed the hurt i felt months ago come back as bitter anger and made me blind to the real problem.

You're welcome.  Philip doesn't seem to be in the Appletons' article, so I doubt I will run across him, and will have to leave the garage in its present miserable shape.

I took a closer look, unfortunately this family had a bent for recycling names. as a result I started a rage and transferred what info you added  to that page Nicholas van Rensselaer
  
LOL there was no rage but a Page I did start P
  
 A move would have been more appropriate.  Wikipedia isn't a genealogy site.  I would say the dreadfully obscure Van Rensselaers should just remain notes on their parents' pages.  And I think the disambiguation more properly belongs on the obscure fellow.   
 So I added a disambiguation to the obscure fellow, and repaired the links and orphaned talk page that resulted from a copy being used instead of a move.  There may be one or two links you have made to Nicholas Van Rensselaer that now need to be sent to Nicholas Van Rensselaer (soldier).

I made one for a Revolutionary soldier. then YOU come along totally deface it with info on a reverend without even bothering to look at dates or anything. So I REPAIRED YOU MISTAKE!

This one restores the following text (for a second time after I had removed it twice):
His job description, or U.N. mandate, deliberately excludes Palestinian human-rights abuses.

Far from being embarrassed, he launched into this year’s diatribe this way: """"Today I deliver my annual criticism of Israel’s human rights record.""""

The relevance is that there is no business model for power accumulation behind it, and that affects the sources available.  Limiting information sources to entrenched power sources (Government, academia and corporate) stacks the deck with biased point of view in favour of power structures, or in the case of the state of this page, makes it impossible to describe UBI.

It is not a book of conjecture or hypothesis. If Davis claims that Mahavatar Babaji is Hairakhan Baba then that is clearly his conclusion, it is not some popular idea that he just presented for the readers to decide, he stated it as a fact.

 Format of quotations 

I've done some copyediting. In particular, there was a problem that a full stop was placed before a footnote, the footnote was added, and another full stop was placed after it. A few quotations had not been closed with quotation marks, etc.

Some quotations have are enclosed in   tags, which seem, according to my eye, to change them into italics but not to do anything else.  I don't see any reason to have some quotations in italics and some not. Actually, I don't see any reason to have any quotations in italics.  We've already had problems (in the Hitler article from which this section comes) with someome putting quotations that implied that Hitler was a fervent Christian in block quotes, and leaving the quotations that implied he was anti-Christian embedded in the text where they wouldn't look so obvious, and later saying that was done according to the length of each quotation (a claim which was refuted by a simple word count). I don't see a pattern in other articles of quotations being in italics.

I'm going to change all of the quotations to plain text (i.e. not italics).  Long quotations can, of course, go in block quotes, regardless of which POV they support. Unrelated to the issue of format is the use of the word """"deplored"""" in the last sentence. I propose changing that to """"rejected"""". """"Deplored"""" suggests shock and anger at the fact that this idea existed, rather than simply rejection of the idea. If I'm mistaken in this (as I don't know whether Hitler condemned the idea that Nazism was a religion, or the the idea that anyone would think it was), please change it back.  ♫ """,0

Good Article review
Using the ever-changing meme catch phrases of the internet, this article is full of win! In other words, I find this article to be richly deserving to GA status, due to its high quality. There can, of course, be some improvements, but nothing that I think represents real failures of the Good Article criteria. The article is neutral almost everywhere, I see no sign of real instability, it seems to fulfill the specific MoS guidelines of the GA criteria nicely, there don't seem to be any obvious gaps in the article's coverage, the referencing is top quality, and the images all seem to be ok. I also have a few comments on more minor things that should help improve this article even further.
You mention """"Conservative clergy"""" as people who opposed the bank, but even though that is exactly the phrase the reference uses, i'm not so sure that's actually what the Islamic equivalent of clergy is called. Might want to look into that. 
The paragraph about the Global Elders seems like it doesn't belong, because it looks less neutral than the rest of the article. """"convened a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and integrity together to the world."""" is entirely subjective and this line is not referenced, I presume this was meant as a direct quote of some statement they made, that should be referenced and the sentence should be framed in a way that makes it clear that it was from a statement, rather than a statement of fact according to Wikipedia alone. 
It looks like the paragraph has more to do with the Global Elders rather than Yunus. It should focus on that Yunus is a member, rather than talk about who is funding the Global Elders and who is the chair and all those details not directly relevant to Yunus. 
In the family section, """"His younger brother Muhammad Jahangir is a popular television presenter."""" doesn't seem to be referenced.

I am curious as to why you are so sensitive to issues pertaining to wikipedia cofounded (which it was) and bomis being a porn search engine (which it was...again). so why haven't you been banned for editing your own biography? and why the censorship on your wikipedia biography? there isn't a controversy section anymore (which I plan to add back in), and criticizing the king (Jimbo) gets you immeadiately banned. in fact, I am pretty sure this will be deleted in the name of protecting """"Jimbo"""". so please, consider what I am saying, and will some editor have the guts to ban Jimbo at least for a while, for vandalising wikipedia (deleting Larry Sanger as a cofounder from a page constitutes as vandalism, whatever may be running through little jimmies head!) 216.102.76.54  """,0

 Traditional or Simplified Chinese? 

I've moved this to a new section because it has become difficult to continue two topics in the same section. I would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of Traditional and Simplified Chinese in TW related articles (without discussing romanisation methods). My aim is just to get a consensus (either way), and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. I have tried posting similar topics in the HK page as well as the manual of style, but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus. 

Why are we still including both sets in these articles?

Naturally I support removing simplified Chinese from TW related articles. It is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the PRC article as it is to include simplified chinese in the ROC article. I am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity, but about de facto usage. Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other? This doesn't have anything to do with anyone's personal views on """"one china"""" or """"two chinas"""", but rather is an issue of reflecting the language situation in both areas and cleaning up articles.

Ah, good catch, thank you, I was going based on the wording of a Times Union article that called it a State historical marker. If the list is indeed complete, please make the note of that invisible, as my note was. When I put a list article up for FL status is when I learned that we dont put statements like """"This is a list of..."""" or """"This is a complete list of..."""" The preferred way of doing an opening paragraph is to actually have a prose that describes and tells about the list rather than being straight forward about it. One I worked on and am proud of is List of incorporated places in New York's Capital District. Some very recently promoted FL's would be the most up-to-date on style preferences used on lists today- such as List of Oregon state symbols which is nearest in type/topic of list to yours that I know of, a search of other list articles of a similar topic and see what they do may be beneficial to this article and the writing of a prose lead. This is really skimpy and just a summary but reading Wikipedia:Featured list criteria could be beneficial if you havent already, or contacting someone who regularly does FL promotion reviews (I can provide you with some names if you want).
Separate from that, perhaps changing the title of the article to expand its scope to include any historical marker would be something you are interested in doing? A separate list article could always be done to cover them. If you're like me and enjoy researching and learning new things, expanding or making a new article for other types of historical markers could be fun and I for one would be very interested in seeing the work and learning more from the hard work that you've shown you do a good job at.

 Seth Material 

Oasis, thank you for the supportive comments that you made on the Seth Material talk page recently.

If you are truly a new editor, there are some things you need to know.  Wikipedia's rules governing editing and the behavior of editors are very poorly written.  They encourage people who have nothing else to do to spend hours and hours on the site each day.  However, once an editor has exhausted his knowledge, any contributions he makes after that are of dubious value.  The result is that there are contingents of what I call """"Wiki-addicts"""" who make little positive contribution to the encyclopedia, but who make a lot of trouble for other editors.  They generally call themselves """"skeptics"""", and they spend hours each day attacking articles they don't like.  They fancy themselves to be guardians of neutrality, but their edits are rarely neutral.  They also fancy themselves to be Wikipedia experts, and consequently they are rarely willing to collaborate.  Generally, they are atheists, right-wing Christians and political conservatives, and they attack articles on topics that are not in the mainstream, especially in the area of religion.  The Seth Material article has suffered from such attacks since it was created a couple years ago.  Recently, several """"skeptics"""" ganged up on me and got me kicked off the article.  The editors who are now in control of it have no knowledge of the Seth Material whatsoever, beyond the fact that they don't like it, so the article is now controlled by editors who would prefer to delete the article altogether.  They have already cut out portions of it.  If you want to see the most complete version of the article, look for the version edited by """"Itsmejudith"""".  You'll find text in there that has since been deleted.

Basically, my message to you is that Wikipedia is a hostile environment, especially if you are interested in topics of religion or spirituality.  If you have things to say in those areas, it is best to do it on your own web site.  With so many editors on Wikipedia intent on censoring information they don't like, it is very hard to make contributions in those areas without getting into non-stop edit-wars.  """,0

To conclude that a person’s statements must have been made under oath before they can be used to corroborate anything – let alone an event that is independently captured on film (and which lends credibility to the waiters’ accounts itself) – is nothing short of a fiction. I strongly recommend that you re-read WP:CITE and WP:RS. I haven’t dug around for mainstream media outlets reporting the news or the video and its authenticity for that matter (primarily because I just don’t care enough at the moment), but rest assured that if they have or do, I will recognize – compliant with Wikipedia guidelines – any Wikipedian’s citation of it.

 Misinformation in the ride description for California Adventure? 

I believe (though I can't prove it) that there are several misstatements in the ride description for California Adventure. The article describes an exact series of drops and rises, but I believer the ride is actually different each time (as is the ride in Florida). I was on it yesterday, rode it twice in a row, and the two rides were very different. I have ridden it several dozen times since it opened, and it has always seemed to be a variable ride. Second, the article says that the elevator unloads in a different place from where it loads, but I wonder about that. On a previous trip I was accompanied by a person in a wheelchair. We left the wheelchair at the immediate entrance to the elevator, after passing through the """"doors"""", and it was waiting for us in the same position when we disembarked. I suppose it's possible that the cast transported it to a different level while we were on the ride.   """,0

 I contend that in the first section, yes Legalese makes a valid point that he does majorly include points to support his edits also, but my assertion that the second section (""""Be civil IAF"""") is meant solely for a personal attack. It merely has the cloak of redundant information i.e. which was already posted earlier by Legalese in another section, and its main aim (as the title itself suggests) is to lecture me about what he percieves is """"civility"""". On this, Legalese definitely deserves a warning .

Again, I may repeat that I have dealt with utmost consternation AND with due respect (while mentioning the Hon'ble SC) my opinion on the judgement which may qualify as Contempt of Courtsomething which Legalese has not and probably does not even bother to looking on the Talk-page. The purpose of repeatedly levelling baseless charges of Contempt of Court, despite my clarification on the same in the talk-page earlier is beyond my comprehension.

The charge that I am not being a """"good"""" editor can only be levelled as a matter of opinion only, (which I too can leve back at him) and not as a complaint because Legalese is NOT an admin, has no authority, has had no authority on wikipedia on matters related to the judgement of the quality of articles, and even final arbitration on what constitutes as """"good editing"""" or """"Objectionable behaviour"""".

His lecture to me on civility (that too publicly on a talk-page and not on my user:page) is itself very appaling to me-who has been contributing to wikipedia since more than a year now. What is even more appaling is his assumption of a role as the Moral Guardian and as someone who discerns the quality of edits. For attempting to accuse me of AND impose the norms of """"civility"""" and that too incongruous on a talk-page of an article and not personally on my own talk-page, Legalese deserves a warning.

Besides, I never said that I find the """"word-war"""" offending to me on part of Legalese. So an Unconditional Apology on my part does not arise at all. """,0

Not only that, Gaijins claim is not logically possible. Any elementary logic shows that what he is claiming is impossible. Think about what you are doing in allowing a vandal like Gaijin to insert fake statistics into articles to suit a political agenda when he has already been topic banned from this area and was just reinstated. He is indeed committing fraud by inserting statistics that aren't in the reference. Also, his reference is 20 years old and is intellectually discredited years ago.

 Morphology 

I think that a few words should be written about endings of various kinds, and of distinctions of cases.  There seems to be some misunderstandings here and there in the project, with claims that """"German has preserved the proto-germanic grammar"""" or similarly.  This is not 100% true (although German certainly has preserved much of the grammar).  I therefore think that mentioning the instrumental case, and the fact that there were more different endings in OHG than in modern High German is interesting enough to merit a section.  I do not think we should try to reproduce all paradigms; but some representative sample.  (However, I just know them from rather old books; and these books do not very carefully distinguish different epochs or dialects within the OHG.)
I had in mind an example like this:

    Sing.    Pl. N    tag    taga G    tages    tago D    tage    tagum A    tag    taga I    tagu    (not distinguishable)

and a few words on how e.g. 1:st and 3:rd p. pl. of the verbs then were quite distinct (in pres. ind. normally ending in -mes and -nt, and in pret. -m and -n, respectively); where in the modern language a final -m is replaced by an -n, making the forms indistinguishable.  Is this sensible?  """,0

Well, one issue at a time:
The last sentence of the 1st paragraph truncates the narrative by jumps from one subject (internal policy) to another (foreign policy), before falling from the sky after decades to following paragraph without even suggest the reason of 1920s military revolts (not to mention that even remotely touches the civilian ones).
To remedy the last flaw of this paragraph, and with citations (easy to check) in English (other section's defect: too many sources in Portuguese, one of them is not even specific to Brazilian history) and
before to deal with the 2nd paragraph [ one issue at a time ) ], I suggest to let the 1st paragraph fine and end the discussion about this paragraph, 
I propose that the mention concerning to changes of Brazil's boundaries  in the early 20th century (even because, the border issue of Acre, in addition to not being the only one of that era, contained in itself a military phase, among others, having not been characterized or reduced to a mere purchase...), be placed at the beginning of the 3rd paragraph in the foreign affairs:

Since it does not seem to me that Bumblebee (rapper) meets these criteria, I have started a discussion about whether this article should be kept or deleted.

Your opinion on whether this article meets the inclusion criteria is welcome. Please contribute to the discussion by adding your comments at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bumblebee (rapper). Don't forget to add four tildes (~~~~) at the end of each of your comments to sign them.

Discussions such as these usually last five days. In the meantime, you are free to edit the content of the article. Please do not remove the """"articles for deletion"""" template (the box at the top). When the discussion has concluded, an administrator will consider all comments and decide whether or not to delete the article.   """,0

I am not trying to be disruptive and I would appreciate it if you was assume good faith. Now that said, I have no doubt that this album will become worthy of an article, but it isn't ready yet.

The problem is, while there are examples of androcentricity in language (although its effect on cognitive and social processes is debatable), the examples she cites are not, and she makes the rather fatal mistake of conflating grammatical gender with """"natural"""" gender and the diachronic with the synchronic analysis of language. She also seems to accept an extreme version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis completely uncritically, although the hypothesis is never even mentioned explicitly in the draft. It's pretty clear the author has not had any formal training in linguistics (or in the languages she has attempted to analyze), and appears not to have consulted the rather vast body of academic literature on androcentric language. Or perhaps she had, but decided ignore the inconvenient conclusions? In any case, it's fairly obvious why the original version of the book was not published by an academic press, and why the revised second version is self-published.

Assume Good Faith Does Not Mean Have Blind Faith Despite the Facts

By repeatedly  for months  citing a book published by St. Martin's Press (New York), """"Feeling Your Pain,"""" as a source of chapter-long damning criticism of the National Civilian Community Corps, LoverOfArt was abusing the name of a respected publishing house and misleading Wikipedia readers.

That St. Martin's Press would publish a book does not of course imply that no competing or contradictory facts exist.  But it does imply that the information has survived a responsible vetting process by fact checkers and lawyers.

(By the way, according to the flap copy of the book,""""Feeling Your Pain,"""" (at least as published in hardcover by St. Martin's Press, 2000), the writing of the author, Bovard, """"has been denounced by FBI Director Louis Freeh, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the White House AIDS czar, as well as by the Chiefs of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. International Trade Commission."""")

As is now clear, """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not even mention NCCC or the National Civilian Community Corps (except in the footnotes, referring to one speech by then-President Clinton  not exactly a source of documented criticism of a program he signed into law), in a chapter devoted to what was then 50,000 members of AmeriCorps, not the 1100+ Corps Members of NCCC.

So to Dbiel and Che Nuevara: It took a lot to get me to sound off about LoverOfArt. I responded calmly to his repeated rants about me, saying I was foaming at the mouth, my writing was Lunacy, fluff, and similar crap.  At this point his """"editing"""" of the National Civilian Community Corps has been conclusively demonstrated as biased and maliciously distorted:  his doctoring of quotes into misleading criticisms of the National Civilian Community Corps (quoting NCCC as having been labeled a """"fraud"""" in an article he cites that does not mention NCCC) should disqualify him from being part of this group.

When I read what he wrote and posted at Wikipedia, quoting the author of Feeling Your Pain as calling NCCC a """"fraud"""" in an article he cites (untrue), saying the author devoted an entire chapter of his book to criticism of NCCC (untrue)  in a book published by St. Martin's Press, even I started to doubt the litany of glowing reports from credible and verifiable sources that I had read about this organization.

Someone unfamiliar with positive reports about NCCC would have been even more likely to greet news of the demise of NCCC - something ardently sought recently by persons using the same kinds of arguments LoverofArt posted  with detachment, if not pleasure.

That his statements  quotes  about NCCC are now known to be false and misleading means that he no longer enjoys an assumption of Good Faith.

So I would like you to spare me your lectures about my supposed sins. """"No information is better than misleading information,"""" as Jimbo Wales liked to say. LoverOfArt has no business mauling the content of this page, nor does Wikipedia have any business disseminating his posts.

I am perfectly ready and willing to work respectfully and cooperatively with any editor who has not used the vicious and underhanded methods that LoverofArt has resorted to.

I have shown a willingness to respond to your editorial concerns. Dbiel wanted more notable sources. I posted a number of them quickly, including citations from the Baltimore Sun, the NY TImes, The Washington Times, and an Arizona newspaper - news outlets reflecting a spectrum of points of view.  (LoverofArt discounted all of the Baltimore Sun citations, saying none were notable.)

I don't maintain that my copy (or my view of what should be at the NCCC page) is perfect or unassailable or that other's work has no place. I have labeled some posts """"suggested edits.""""  I have no problem with honest content that is in context that runs counter to my perspective.

But LoverofArt is clearly willing to resort to dishonest (or at the very least, grossly misleading) editing to ensure that his view prevails.  My editing reflects my perspective, but it  is not dishonest:  I present information that is verifiable and accurate, to the best of my ability.  If I make a mistake, and I sometimes do, I try to correct it, and I would welcome the correction of others - I do not want to be have a part in disseminating inaccurate or misleading information.  

I left LoverofArt's Criticisms page on the NCCC article for a long time, until I could verify whether or not it was accurate.  That is the mark of responsible editing.

Dbiel, I respect your knowledge of the Wikipedia way of doing",0

The Crying of Lot 49

ONE summer afternoon Mrs Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much kirsch in the fondue to find that she, Oedipa, had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of one Pierce Inverarity, a California real estate mogul who had once lost two million collars in his spare time but still had assets numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary. Oedipa stood in the living room, stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube, spoke the name of God, tried to feel as drunk as possible. But this did not work. She thought of a hotel room in Mazatlan whose door had just been slammed, it seemed forever, waking up two hundred birds down in the lobby; a sunrise over the library slope at Cornell University that nobody out on it had seen because the slope faces west; a dry, disconsolate tune from the fourth movement of the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra; a whitewashed bust of Jay Gould that Pierce kept over the bed on a shelf so narrow for it she'd always had the hovering fear it would someday topple on them. Was that how he'd died, she wondered, among dreams, crushed by the only ikon in the house? That only made her laugh, out loud and helpless: You're so sick, Oedipa, she told herself, or the room, which knew.

The letter was from the law firm of Warpe, Wist-full, Kubitschek and McMingus, of Los Angeles, and signed by somebody named Metzger. It said Pierce had died back in the spring, and they'd only just now found the will. Metzger was to act as co-executor and special counsel in the event of any involved litigation. Oedipa had been named also to execute the will in a codicil dated a year ago. She tried to think back to whether anything unusual had happened around then. Through the rest of the afternoon, through her trip to the market in downtown Kinneret-Among-The-Pines to buy ricotta and listen to the Muzak (today she came through the bead-curtained entrance around bar 4 of the Fort Wayne Settecento Ensemble's variorum recording of the Vivaldi Kazoo Concerto, Boyd Beaver, soloist); then through the sunned gathering of her marjoram and sweet basil from the herb garden, reading of book reviews in the latest Scientific American, into the layering of a lasagna, garlicking of a bread, tearing up of romaine leaves, eventually, oven on, into the mixing of the twilight's whiskey sours against the arrival of her husband, Wendell (""""Mucho"""") Maas from work, she wondered, wondered, shuffling back through a fat deckful of days which seemed (wouldn't she be first to admit it?) more or less identical, or all pointing the same way subtly like a conjurer's deck, any odd one readily clear to a trained eye. It took her till the middle of Huntley and Brinkley to remember that last year at three or so one morning there had come this long-distance call, from where she would never know (unless now he'd left a diary) by a voice beginning in heavy Slavic tones as second secretary at the Transyl-vanian Consulate, looking for an escaped bat; modulated to comic-Negro, then on into hostile Pachuco dialect, full of chingas and maricones; then a Gestapo officer asking her in shrieks did she have relatives in Germany and finally his Lamont Cranston voice, the one he'd talked in all the way down to Mazatlan. """"Pierce, please,"""" she'd managed to get in, """"I thought we had""""

""""But Margo,"""" earnestly, """"I've just come from Commissioner Weston, and that old man in the fun house was murdered by the same blowgun that killed Professor Quackenbush,"""" or something.

""""For God's sake,"""" she said. Mucho had rolled over and was looking at her.

""""Why don't you hang up on him,"""" Mucho suggested, sensibly.

""""I heard that,"""" Pierce said. """"I think it's time Wendell Maas had a little visit from The Shadow."""" Silence, positive and thorough, fell. So it was the last of his voices she ever heard. Lamont Cranston. That phone line could have pointed any direction, been any length. Its quiet ambiguity shifted over, in the months after the call, to what had been revived: memories of his face, body, things he'd given her, things she had now and then pretended not to've heard him say. It took him over, and to the verge of being forgotten. The shadow waited a year before visiting. But now there was Metzger's letter. Had Pierce called last year then to tell her about this codicil? Or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and Mucho's indifference? She felt exposed, finessed, put down. She had never executed a will in her life, didn't know where to begin, didn't know how to tell the law firm in L. A. that she didn't know where to begin.

""""Mucho, baby,"""" she cried, in an access of helplessness.

Mucho Maas, home, bounded through the screen door. """"Today was another defeat,"""" he began.

My name is Dean Estes. I met Snakefinger (Mr. Lithman) in 1981 when he and his band played on the front lawn of our high school. One of his band members, a former Dead Kennedy, had attended the school and made this cool event possible. I don't know why Steve Crabtree claims that Lithman was American and was not of European descent. Technically it may be true that the UK is not part of """"Europe"""" despite being a charter member of the EU, but Mr. Crabtree's claims risk giving an false impression. Phil """"Snakefinger"""" Lithman was English, as is easily verified and as was clearly obvious when the man spoke. Perhaps Steve meant that Snakefinger was living in America? (Specifically San Francisco.) Two years later I was fortunate enough to befriend one of The Residents. While I was savvy enough not to ask certain questions until enough trust had been earned, I do recall, during a discussion of the The Residents' remarkably unique sense of harmonization, asking if N. Senada had actually existed. My Resident acquaintance simply smiled and shrugged his shoulders, which I knew was a nice way of saying """"we aren't going there,"""" so I didn't pursue it. I believe it's pretty obvious that """"the mysterious N. Senada"""" never actually existed when you review the various things that have been said about him. Isn't the amusing play on the name of the Baja Mexican town """"Ensenada"""" clue enough? However, this is another case where the question of whether or not such aspects of the Residents mythos """"matter"""" is perfectly valid. Of course it doesn't really matter. As one of the people who actually does know the answers to some of the speculation here, it's so strange, seeing how some people post misinformation with conviction (intentionally?) while others deny facts. For the most part, to quote an old Eno lyric, """"those who know, they don't let it show.""""  -) Mystery and myth are more fun, and I think it's safe to say that's part of the point of the Residents' myriad mysteries. Nevertheless, while Snakefinger protected The Residents' secrets, he wasn't secretive about his own """"real"""" identity or history at all. My apologies to Steve if I've misunderstood him.""",0

 Query 

I suppose I should have taken the point better when you made it here. This is neither a challenge, a complaint, nor a whine, or an attempt to """"gotcha"""" but a ood–faith question and a related comment on which I'd like your observations.
Question: John Bapst Memorial High School 2005 was nominated — not by me — and subsequently deleted yesterday under A7. (I think that's the one, not being a sysop — ahem () — I can't go back to look to make sure.) The entire text of the article was something like, """"Composed of people born in 1986 and 1987. Said to be the best class to ever graduate from this school."""" As I understand from the discussions at Talk:CSD, an indication of importance or significance is credible if it is plausible, even if it is vague and unsupported. That school's class of 2005 could, in fact, have been the best to graduate from that school in many different ways: highest GPA, most athletic championships, fewest teenage pregnancies, or in a 5–year retrospect, most graduates to be admitted to Ivy League schools. None of that is, of course, probably what the creator meant, which was probably nothing more than chauvinistic chest–thumping (but we must AGF). Was that an indication of importance or significance such that the article should not have been A7 nominated or deleted on that basis?
Comment: If I were to start declining A7 speedy noms by strictly applying the criteria you set out at my RfA nomination, viz """"A7 simply does not apply if there is any credible indication of importance or significance"""", then I have the suspicion that at my next RfA nomination, if I choose to try again (and your responses here may help me decide whether or not I will do so), that I may have a hoard of opposers claiming that I'm perverting the CSD process by glibly dismissing valid CSD nominations. I'm concerned that by working on CSD nominations at all that I'm stuck between the battle lines drawn by the deletionists and the inclusionists. If I have any remaining desire for the mop, wouldn't it be better to just avoid CSD altogether?

Hey TParis, can you repost this to WP talk:RFA for me. Someone locked my IP for telling a couple of abusive admins off. Otherwise I'll find a way to do it later...never mind maybe I'll just change my IP again so I'll take care of it later.
Great catch, the one I was talking about was the broken link in RFA tools. I didn't even know about the other 2 you found so although you might think it was childish, the project benefited from you reviewing the templates. For what its worth, its also childish for the community to tell an editor who devoted years to the project they aren't trusted and that their edits must be reviewed by an admin to be implemented but then have the admins doing the change admit they wouldn't know if they were correct or not. Its childish to allow admins to abuse the system and generally hold them to a lessor standard of editquette but then treat editors like second class citizens in the site. There are tons of childish things going on within this site, but my decision to not do the work because the community doesn't trust the work I do, after doing it for years, isn't particularly childish. If there was more trust in this community I would still be a high output contributor and would have made that change to the RFA template back in July when I found it...along with a dozen others with other templates and the myriad of vandalism that still sits on articles in my watchlist (I assume, because I locked my account so now I can't see it). 108.45.104.158",0

CONCLUSIONS 

Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome... Medicines that affect pain perception, sleep, and mood have been useful and should be integrated with activity, exercise, and educational programs. Most patients with FM observed in tertiary referral centers report little change in their symptoms over time. The outcome is directly related to psychosocial factors, including past and current psychological distress and work status or disability issues. As with any chronic illness, patients in the community do better than those observed in specialty clinics. Ten percent to 30% of patients describe being work impaired from FM. Physicians should discourage inactivity and disability because, if these are prolonged, there is an adverse effect on prognosis. Finally, patients have found a diagnostic label to be reassuring, and the diagnosis has decreased costly testing and health care use. ...

 Censorship 

Was Final Fantasy VII censored at all? I mean, the content wasn't as strong as, say, Final Fantasy VIII's, but I would imagine something was censored. Plus, it doesn't say anything about censorship on this page. Could someone please answer to this? 
Not that I recall. It certainly wasn't censored as much as the older games were.  
As I recall, some language was censored, some wasn't.  
The word """"bastard"""" appeared on various occasions, but """"fuck"""" and """"shit"""" were censored.  
< recet indent
Some words were censored, some were not, which ones seem arbitrary.
Only instance I could find of """"Fuck"""" uncensored:
Computer: Cid! We have an emergency situation! A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
Cid: What!? Who is the little fuck!?
Computer: I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Cid: Hey goddammit!! Who the #*$$#&'s still in there?
Earliest instance of """"Shit""""
Shinra Manager: I'm not give in to violence…and I'm not giving you my seat either!
Tifa: Barret!!
Barret: #^*$!! You lucky #$#*!
Cloud: So, what are we gonna do now?
Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm…
In total, """"Fuck"""" is said uncensored once, """"Shit"""" is said uncensored 12 times, """"ass"""" is said 15 times (sometimes occuring as Jackass), """"Damn"""" is said 68 times, and I couldn't find any occurances of """"Bastard"""".  Censored words appear approx. 33 times.  
My version must be different.  The """"fuck"""" is censored, and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted, the first word was uncensored(though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle, making it """"shi't"""".  I noted a lot of uncensored """"ass"""" and """"shit"""" though, and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long, going back and playing FFVII, I was a little surprised by the language.  In fact, it's the only Fantasy RPG I've ever played with uncensored profanity.  But yes, it was at least partially censored. 
 Nevertheless, unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever, we can't include this in the article. — er 
Well, the box says it's rated teen for mild language and violence...  But I'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue.. 
Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really don't think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia.  And even the slight mention is iffy to me.   
Well, it's the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language.  But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guidelines of the time. 
It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version. Almost every instance of """"shit"""" was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. """"Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees"""", for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version.  

I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.

Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall. """"Slightly stretched underwear"""" was changed to """"Therapeutic underwear."""" Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought """"slightly stretched"""" was sexually inappropriate. (The item is found in Tifa's dresser drawer during the nibelhiem flashback sequence.)

During the epilogue that follows, the ruins of Midgar are shown five hundred years later. While the landscape had once been desolate due to Shinra's operations, it is now a land of lush greenery.

I have marked up a few sections, e.g. Punic Wars, Government, Economy, Games and recreation, that need more references.

There is scope for an image in Punic Wars - you could have Hannibal and Scipio side-by-side, perhaps.

""""Quaestors were made automatic members of the Senate"""". Perhaps they were automatically made members.

Adjectives are somewhat astray in some places, e.g. """"the famous Hadrian's Wall"""", the """"famously decisive Battle of Zama"""" - who says it's famous?

Image captions: there are many people here, over a very long time period, so dates might be a help in the captions.

The maps are noticeably in very different (ok, random) styles, which is quite distracting to the reader. It would be desirable (so, not a GA requirement) to harmonise these.

References are formatted very diversely, from naked links to full citations. This is not a GA issue but needs to be tidied up radically for FA.""",0
"""

You told me that I shouldn't write edits about general discussion on the talk pages of articles in Wikipedia. But this time it was different. Whereas last time you were talking about the talk pages of articles, this time we are talking about the talk pages of users. Whereas article talk pages were general and public, user talk pages were personal and private. They were different and very different from each other. I thought they were personal and private. I thought they were different and very different from each other. When you said that talk pages were not for general discussion, I thought you were just talking about the talk pages of articles, not the talk pages of users. Although general discussion wasn't allowed in the talk pages of articles, which were public, I thought they would be okay in the talk pages of users, which were personal and private. I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia, or at least not too much or as much as in a public part. That was one reason why I didn’t thought what you told me in the article talk page meant that I shouldn’t make the edits then in the talk pages of those users.

What I did in those edits was sending, telling, and giving messages and requests, not general discussion. I thought it wasn't general discussion. That was different, perhaps very different, from general discussion, or discussion of any sort. I thought it was different. Whereas discussion is two-way and consists of several people talking together, sending messages is, or can be, just one-way, involving and being done by just one person, or both. Whereas discussion needs or involves response or repliance, sending messages doesn't need or involve sending responses or replies. The user of the talk page doesn't need to write anything in response, I just wanted him to read it and do what it asked him to. The messages and requests sent were not general either. They were special and specific, sent for a special reason about a special subject in a special time and situation. Those were not general discussion also because they were done in the talk page of a user, not the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk. I thought that was a reason why they weren’t discussion. If it was done in the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk, it would probably be discussion because it was one person talking and dicussing about this to lots of other people and a group in Wikipedia and telling and encouraging them to tell and discuss about it with each other, in a public place. But it was done in the talk page of a user, it would be just sending and telling a message because it was just with one other person and telling and saying something personally and individually to him, one way, in a private place. I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia, or at least not too much or as much as in a public part.

Although you may think what I did in the user talk pages was very bad, it's not really that bad. I thought it was not really that bad, wrong, and serious, especially if it was just done once or only very rarely. That was one reason why I did and would have done those edits on the user talk pages. I didn't really know and understand how bad you would think it would be. I didn’t think it would be really that bad. I thought it would just either result in no response from you, another warning from you, or a block that is at least not indefinite. There were actually several reasons why it's not really that bad, or at least I thought it wasn't that bad. First, it would not have actually made any real difference or bad effect to Wikipedia or its general and public contents, facts, statements, and information, etc. It wasn't damage or disruption because it was adding information, not changing or removing information. It was added in a user talk page, a place for adding messages and not for containing facts about one specific topic. Second, it was done in the personal and private part of Wikipedia. It would be just the users of the talk pages themselves who would see, read, and look at those edits, or would just need to do so, and so you don't really even need to care or mind about it, at least not too much. Third, they probably would not mind or dislike those edits onto their talk pages, or they might even be glad to see them. Fourth, even if they didn't like having those edits being on their talk pages, they could simply delete and remove it, or perhaps also make a copy of it and place it somewhere else, or simply just ignore it. Fifth, if you don't like them you could simply go to my Special:Contributions and quickly delete all of those edits. Those were several reasons why I thought they were not really that bad, wrong, and serious.

I think we may be getting off-track here.  Whether or not the word """"alleged"""" is removed from the title of this article at a later date should not be triggered simply by whether or not a court of law convicts Mr. Arbabsiar and Mr. Shakuri.  The reliable sourcing and facts will have to be reviewed at that time (or at any time, as new information emerges) and consensus worked out here on the talk page to the community's satisfaction.  I doubt the criminal trial proceedings will resolve that... sure, a conviction or acquittal will result one way or another for the two defendants at issue, but it's an entirely different question as to whether or not evidence emerges at trial conclusively demonstrating that the Iranian Government orchestrated the plot and directed it.  Reliable sourcing and the prevailing views should weigh more than what we as Wikipedia editors think in our own personal opinions.  In time, we shall see what facts are presented, and the argument can be revisited and reviewed in it's entirety.  So let's just resolve the issue of the article title for now, shall we?

The question is not whether the incident reflects badly on Kennedy, but whether it's important enough to include in this article.  We have to make judgments about that.  There's a discussion going on right now at the George W. Bush article about including a reference to the calls for impeaching Bush.  You could write a factually accurate sentence or paragraph about it, but most of us think it should be omitted anyway, because it's just not important.  No one has even suggested (as far as I remember) that the Bush article include a paragraph about his brother and the Silverado scandal.

I was told that I could plead guilty to something, I have no idea what, something about soliciting for business or ride.  No one employed in any part of this was capable of reading the statute aloud.  The public defender told me I could sit, literally sit, in booking for four days and nights until the officer was subpoenaed and then the case would be dismissed or I could be released that afternoon.

I was arrested for and while sitting on a guard rail while holding a piece of cardboard with """"Hard Times / God Bless / Blessed Day"""" on it.  I was not provided with any documentation of my own of my having been arrested at anytime.  I was not told the offense for which I was being arrested.  One police officer said """"Soliciting"""" to me.  I was lied to with statements of """"You can find the statute underwhich you are being arrested at metro.com"""" and """"you can see what happened at nashvillemetro.com""""  I was not given any reason for why I was being arrested, and at least 20 cars drove by clearly listening in on the scanner to see what was going on.  I have no idea what they were accusing me of, whom the arresting officer was, whom the public defender was, whom the prosecuting attorney was, whom the magistrate was, nor whom some guy I have no idea what function is who told everyone that if they asked any questions of the magistrate that the magistrate would take unkindly upon them and would force them into further holding for non-competence.

"aesthetics 
From the 1911 Britanica Encyclopedia:

Greek Speculations
Ancient Greece supolies us with 
the first important contributions to aesthetic theory, 
though these are scarcely, in quality or in quantity, what 
one might nave expected from a people which had so high an 
appreciation of beauty and so strong a bent for philosophic 
speculation.  The first Greek thinker of whose views on the 
subject we really know something is Socrates.  We learn from 
Xenophon's account of him that he regarded the beautiful as 
coincident with the good, and both of them are resolvable 
into the useful.  Every beautiful object is so called because 
it serves came rational end, whether the security or the 
gratification of man.  Socrates appears to have attached 
little importance to the immediate gratification which a 
beauriful object affords to perception and contemplation, 
but to have emphasized rather its power of furthering the 
more necessary ends of life.  The really valuable point in 
his doctrine is the relativity of beauty.  Unlike Plato, 
he recognized no self-beauty (auto to kalon) existing 
absolutely and out of all relation to a percipient mind. 

Plato

Of the views of Plato on the subject, it is hardly less difficult 
to gain a clear conception from the Dialogues, than it is in 
the case of ethical good.  In some of these, various definitions 
of the beautiful are rejected as inadequate by the Platonic 
Socrates.  At the same time we may conclude that Plato's mind 
leaned decidedly to the conception of an absolute beauty, 
which took its place in his scheme of ideas or self-exisiing 
forms.  This true beauty is nothing discoverable as an 
attribute in another thing, for these nre only beautiful things, 
not the beautiful itself.  Love (Eros) produces aspiration 
towards this pure idea.  Elsewhere the soul's intuition of the 
self-beautiful is said to be a reminiscence of its prenatal 
existence.  As to the precise forms in which the idea of beauty 
reveals itself, Plato is not very decided.  His theory of an 
absolute beauty does not easily adjust itself to the notion 
of its contributing merely a variety of sensuous pleasure, 
to which he appears to lean in some dialogues.  He tends 
to identify the self-beautiful with the conceptions of the 
true and the good, and thus there arose the Platonic formula 
kalokagathia. So far as his writings embody the notion of 
any common element in beautiful objects, it is proportion, 
harmony or unity among their parts.  He emphasizes unity in 
its simplest aspect as seen in evenness of line and purity of 
colour.  He recognizes in places the beauty of the mind, and 
seems to think that the highest beauty of proportion is to 
be found in the union of a beautiful mind with a beautiful 
body.  He had but a poor opinion of art, regarding it as a 
trick of imitation (mimesis) which takes us another step 
farther from the luminous sphere of rational intuition into 
the shadowy region of the semblances of sense.  Accordingly, 
in his scheme for an ideal republic, he provided for the most 
inexorable censorship of poets, &c.;, so as to make art as far 
as possible an instrument of moral and political training. 

Aristotle

Aristotle proceeded to a more serious investigation of the 
aesthetic phenomena so as to develop by scientific analysis 
certain principles of beauty and art.  In his treatises on 
poetry and rhetoric he gives us, along with a theory of these 
arts, certain general principles of beauty; and scattered among 
his other writings we find many valuable suggestions on the same 
subject.  He seeks (in the Metaphysics) to distinguish the 
good and the beautiful by saying that the former is always in 
action (`en praxei) whereas the latter may exist in motionless 
things as well (`en akinetois.) At the same time he had 
as a Greek to allow that though essentially different things 
the good might under certain conditions be called beautiful.  
He further distinguished the beautiful from the fit, and in 
a passage of the Politics set beauty above the useful and 
necessary.  He helped to determine another characteristic 
of the beautiful, the absence of all lust or desire in the 
pleasure it bestows.  The universal elements of beauty, 
again, Aristotle finds (in the Metaphysics) to be order 
(taxis), symmetry and definiteness or determinateness (to 
orismenon).  In the Poetics he adds another essential, 
namely, a certain magnitude; it being desir",0

I essentially replaced the wording, eliminating """"most"""" from """"most widely."""" Jayjg reverted, but I'm going to put it in again absent a good argument against doing this. Maimonides' version clearly is widely used  Wikipedia's own article on the 613 mitzvot includes Maimonides' list as its only example, and describes Maimonides' work that included the list as """"The most important of the above works"""" from a list of works that include versions of the list. It is also the only version that I have seen reproduced anywhere online. While Jay claims that the absence of aliyah from Maimonides' list should not be mentioned because virtually every other list includes it, that is not logical if Maimonides' list is """"the most important"""" of the lists; it is essentially original research for Jay to conclude that the singularity of the absence of aliyah to Maimonides' list makes it not worth mentioning.
I'm sure it is true that others of Maimonides' writings indicate what Jay alleges, but the text from the article refers particularly to the 613 commandments. It would make sense (in fact, when I replace the wording, I'll do it myself) to note that Maimonides' other writings tend to contradict the omission, but that does not necessarily nor, I think, in fact warrant suppressing the note about the """"most important"""" of the mitzvot lists being the exception to the statement in the article.
Jay describes the clarification as """"uncited POV,"""" which may be true regarding """"most widely,"""" which I eliminated, but not """"widely,"""" nor anything else about the clarification. It is also highly selective, clearly, not to note that the exception to including aliyah in the mitzvot comes from perhaps the most important of the versions.

"Finaly the Truth from Maratha  Vishal1976 

I have posted many images of Hindu / Arya /Indian wrestlers but just got time to read this rediculious discussion about this very article and i want to show , point out the realites about the wrestling and ground leval facts. But important i don't want to insult any one , specially the creator of this article but just want to show the truth.
1) The objection that the art of wrestling never existed in india and it is imported from Iran and other outside countries is pure colonial tact. As you can find out that any good thing which comes from India is not real Indian / Aryan / Hindu but is imported from outside to India and we Indians are basterd offsprings from that .No new to we!! The great Alfanso Mangos are not local from Konkan region but are brought to India by the Portugies and such other numerious theories put in this new world firstly by the British and later by Amiricanus. Brother Iranians i have read little history of Iran. As we all know that originaly all Iranians befoure the birth of Islam were not muslims but Aryan as the word Iran itself stands for littrley as the dewwlling of Aryans outside mainland India. And what happned when the Arabs now converted to Islam attacted to Iran ?? Were the gret Iranians who now boast that they are the creator and founder of this wrestling art able to protect the own country and ther religion ?? No!! No!!. And to escape from this attct wher the Iranians flead ?? Even to China !! O.K NOW TELL ME WE Aryans/ Marathas / Hindus / Indians fought 1000 years to Islamic invision and reuled and 200 years of British rule and now where are we and where are those grate Mughals/ Brtish / Afghans/ Pakistanis/ Turks / ETC . Thre truth is that we Aryans / Marathas / Hindus / Indians not only surveyed but overcome this invision and eat those invaders and will eat in feauter. We were succesful not only to get freedom but also keep alive our Arya/ Hindu religion along with our gods , traditions , educations such as Ayurveda , Yoga . Dance , Music and all other properties.
I dont want to get involved in to more discussion because i am alone and in my surrounding neberhood yor fans and brothers are present. I am awere of this fact as anyone can gess from the present condition of India.

2) The objection that the WWF wrestling in the world is facke , circus and not worthy to call as real wrestling and those who perform it as wrestler. Yess. I do agree. I have seen those WWF entertienment on cable TV sINCE 1992 and from the begining i was desliking to this Americanus beggares play. But in reality in my surrounding i have observerd great wrestlers and seen how much respect our Maratha society gives to these wrestlers.The traditional Maratha wrestling and wrestler has many sides and aspects , i will discuss it later but any way one can understand it if he is clever.Allthough these Indian wrestler are not successful in international competations such as Olympics , But if you see the ecomomic and weather conditions of India you may find the answer.In our Maratha society wrestiling is a good social title and way of life such as Docters and other professionals.   I use to workout and do exircise when i was in school and college and aimes to earn great body. I never exirsised in traditional Indian mud wrestling gym but in western kind of modern gym and before that some traditional exirsises and other like cricket , boxind etc.
I am owner of good body and realy have loved and perpormed workouts so i belive that i have right to say somthing about wrestling.
3)  As we can see now that the western world is now accepting the importance of Ayurveda and othe Aryan traditions and properties so in neare feature this Aryan art may see good days ans enriche the humanity.",0

 2010 team roster 

Moved from User talk:Kevin McE

Hi there. I wonder if you might be able to clarify your reason for making this edit where you cited WP:CRYSTAL. I'm not clear on why the information you removed is inappropriate. Thanks.   

I don't know what needs to be explained.  We cannot say with certainty that those riders will ride for that team next year, because we do not know the future.  An encyclopaedia reports facts, not expectations.    

Hi again. Firstly, I moved your comment back here to keep this in one place so it is easier to follow. I am still not clear exactly what at WP:CRYSTAL makes this content inappropriate. This is not a predicted team roster, it is verifiable and very likely to be accurate since the chance of Team Sky confirming they have signed a contract with a rider for 2010 and then that not happening must be very slim.   

It is verifiable that these men have signed to ride for that team next year, that is in the preceding paragraph and I would not challenge the appropriateness of stating that.  A 2010 roster (not a word that should be used on an article about a UK subject, but that is a different matter) is not something that exists in 2009, and even as a speculative list, it is so incomplete as to be meaningless; it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles, but these are not the point.  Returning to the Crystal balling issue, you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim: you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility, and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact.  Let's hope it doesn't happen, but Sky might go bust, or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury, before 1 January, in which case 2010 will arrive, they will not be part of the team, and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error.  Facts, not expectation.    

I will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in 2010 doesn't mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in 2010 and that the team might not even exist. However, all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in 2010, that makes them part of the squad for 2010. We're not simply expecting them to be, they are confirmed to be. Surely though, we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen. I think you are misinterpreting WP:CRYSTAL. I'd suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable, as is the case here. If it turns out that any or all of these riders don't ride for Team Sky in 2010 then the Wikipedia article won't have been """"guilty of having recorded an error"""" because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available.   

I'm not saying that it won't happen, nor that it is not very likely, but that it is expectation, not fact.  You speak of verifiability, but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable.  If they were to die before the end of this year, they will not be in the 2010 team: the future is not confirmed.  An """"entirely accurate description"""" of something that does not currently exist is not possible (and as a description, a 6 man top level racing squad is not entirely accurate).   

I find your position on this matter a little strange. You seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so, seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change. The names that are being announced are for the 2010 squad, so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such. We can, and should, only base the article on what can be verified at the current time, and that is that the riders named are part of the team for 2010. The information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in 2010 and our article is, and should, only ever be based upon information available at the time. I would note that, not only has another user reverted the change you made which I am concerned about here, but also that a further ten names have been announced",0

Dick I feel for you.  The peer commentaries and other IMO arguably relevant SPS's are inadmissible here on wikipedia for any number of reasons.

As their own BLP what they write about themselves is admissiable.  However as far as trying to get such sources admitted in general no dice.  We went through TWO RSN's on this.

 Alleged Cyaxares tomb 

Sources disagree with Kurdo-bigot claims:
At the so-called “Median” stone tombs, which are now recognized as the burial places of late Achaemenid notables (Gall, 1966), there are scroll capitals somewhat resembling Ionic forms (e.g., those on the tomb of Qyzqapan; Gall, 1988, pp. 557ff.; see Figure 57h). 
At Cambridge history of Iran  text also say that scholars incline to post-Achaemenid dating.
Current version claims tomb is """"identified by Diakonoff"""" while in Iranica article  (published years after his earlier works) he doesn't even mention it.
Obivously, theory about """"Cyaxares' tomb"""" is abandoned. I see Wikipedia is becoming CHARLATANOPEDIA, because even admins stand after Kurdish ultra-nationalist and bigots. Shame. 109.165.198.30  """,0
""":Both in current numbers (24%) and in historical context, Roman Catholics are a minority religion in America. Even among Christian """"believers"""", the ratio is more than two to one in favor of Protestants. This is no suprise: of the 13 colonies, only one had a significant Catholic presence (Maryland). Today, of the 24% Catholics, most (about 12-14% of the country) are now Catholic hispanics, mostly in California, Texas, and Florida (probably more, with undocumented Mexicans). The remainder are mostly Irish and Italian Catholics, in the Northeastern cities. Likewise most Protestants in the country are segregated, and live in the South and Midwest. There is a religious segregation in the country that muddies the appreciation of the """"other"""". Of the Protestant/Reformation movement, most are mainline or evangelical/born again/fundamentalist churches. Orthodox are not a Reformation faith, but Mormans and Pentacostals probably trace origins through the chaotic, developing Reformation movement. Of the 20% not now calling themselves Christian, most are agnostic (probably with mostly Protestant roots), but some are Muslim, Jewish, or have Asian-rooted faiths. The main things apparently affecting religious population size are: Mexican immigration (Catholic), mainline Protestant church attendance and birthrate (declining), conservative Protestant activism (increasing), intermarriage (tending toward dominant faith of partners or agnosticism, ergo all """"conservative"""" churches, born-agains, opus dei, othodox jewry increasing). In sum, Roman Catholics may be a plurality denomination (24%) compared to next largest (Baptists), but a Christian faith/movement smaller in size by half than the Protestant/Reformation movement, and again, in historical context in America, not a surprise. -2 November 2005

Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.

Mario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.

The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).

Battle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. 

Every Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.

A new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.

There is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do.
Blue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.
Red Space - You lose three coins.
Green Happening Space - A special board event takes place.
Warp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent's space you will warp to.
Mushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small). Choose one, and you will be given either a Mini Mushroom or a Mega Mushroom. (Note: The Mega Mushroom is not always in the large box, and the Mini Mushroom is not always in the small box.)
Battle Space - A battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. The better you finish in the minigame, the more coins you will get back from the pot.
Bowser Space - Bowser may steal items from players or a Bowser minigame may begin.
Fortune Space - A reversal of fortune begins, in which players may have to give coins or stars to others. The player who landed",0

"This is total tripe!!  A bunch of brainwaahed, Glasweigian, nutters running down Goodison Rd does not prove a Catholic bias at EFC. Or, some loons in the Kop on a derby day.   Neither does Mr Baxter being a Catholic.  I doubt he knocked on the doors of catholic homes and goaded them to EFC.  Most people would not have heard of him.  The EFC committee was predominately Liberal and Houlding Tory being councillor.  Many of the EFC committee were in temperance societies, Houlding was a brewer and they viewed he wanted to sell his ales at Anfield - he wanted sole refreshments rights.  Houlding insisted the teams changed at his Sandon pub and walk to the ground.  Holding made money from this in sales. 

The split at EFC creating Liverpool was purely principles.  No religion at all.  Everton wanted a community based club with a spread of shares. Houlding wanted a few rich owners holding most of the shares - the corporate model which is still the same today.  Everton on going to Goodison Park issued 5,000 shares for the fans. EFC were the first to have a shareholders association and the meets are always in the Liverpool Echo.  Everton put the profits back into the club for the benefit of the fans, and by the 1930s had 4 double-decked stands, while Anfield was primitive in comparison because the owners creamed off - despite both clubs having about the same sized fanbase.  Anfield was only uprated in 1963 with the Kemlyn Rd stand, the rest being 1906 at the latest - two years later EFC were hosting a world cup semi-final, the difference was so marked.

From Leeds university study. Link on the history site. Stored at Cambridge university.

Leeds University Study:-

Both of the city’s major clubs share a common origin. An Everton football club was established as a small chapel team in 1878, it became a founder member of the Football League in 1888, first won the championship in 1890-91, and at that time played its home matches at Anfield. By the early 1890s, however, the club was in serious difficulties, experiencing a traumatic internal schism that tore through its management and ownership and led to the creation of a second club.

The club’s main financial backer was Houlding, a prominent brewer and Tory politician but, amidst allegations of financial exploitation, in 1892 the majority of the club’s members abandoned the Anfield site, removed the club from Houlding’s control and set out for Goodison – in retaliation, Houlding incorporated a new club, Liverpool F.C, based at Anfield.

The story of the schism provides an important illustration of how far a successful professional football organization had become integrated into community identity and politics by the late Victorian period. In an early manifestation of today’s frictions between commercial backers and fans, the research shows that the intensity of the wrangling over the governance and ownership of the club bore witness to the importance, even at that early date, of perceptions of the club as a worthy political prize, as a means by which wealthy individuals could gain influence and prestige.

The historical dispute at Everton also emphasises significant contemporary perceptions of the role an iconic football club could play in moulding social behaviour. The owners and directors of the new Everton F.C. believed such an important social institution could be a bastion of ‘purity’, a model of Christian sobriety, of Nonconformist, Liberal ideals. In governance terms they sought to carry over the original ideal of a more democratic ‘members’ club’ into the era of incorporation.

Houlding, too, was well aware of the importance of a successful football club for community identity and involvement, but he believed a corporate structure based on a ‘modern’ business model (wherein investors had control and could expect a reasonable rate of return) was more appropriate. His behaviour at Everton F.C., and his subsequent success in establishing Liverpool F.C., reveal his attempts to weld together politics and sport in such a way as to wield influence in both, to help secure the support base for his brand of ‘Tory Democracy’.

However, the difficulties he encountered at Everton F.C. also show the strength of opposing political perceptions. The alternative Liberal vision of the sober artisan football supporter, closely involved in the affairs of his club through membership and diverse shareholdings, and wary of autocratic manipulations from the drinks trade, proved capable of wrenching Everton F.C. from Houlding’s control even if, after only a short time, he was able to establish a successful rival club.

Another feature of the schism was that it occurred within Protestant ranks for, despite the prominence often assigned to the role of sectarianism in Liverpool politics – and despite the political importance of Irish Home",0

 Boat Race reviews 

  The Running Man Barnstar Hey Dom497, just a quick barnstar to say thanks for the reviews of Boat Race articles you've conducted over the past year.  As of this morning, I completed my (initial) goal of ensuing that every Boat Race had, not only its own article, but one that was either of GA or FA status:  we now have 158 GAs and 3 FAs that we can all be proud of!  It doesn't stop here, for me at least, I'm going to keep up with improving the quality of the GAs and look for more FA opportunities.  Plus, there's the small matter of 70 Women's Boat Race articles to get up and running!  But thanks again, I couldn't have done it without your help.

"""

 Bias? 

It seems a little weighted towards Al-Megrahi being wrongly convicted, just does not read neutral to me. I've subsequently tagged the article, to see if anyone could take a look and see if they can do anything about it. Cheers.   

Well, according to the article:

...the SCCRC concluded its four-year review and, having uncovered evidence that a miscarriage of justice could have occurred...

So, giving some considerable weight to doubts about his guilt would be justified.   

That is true, but it stands that he is a convicted mass murderer who took the lives of hundreds of people. To have the majority of the article weighted towards his alleged innocence/appeals etc seems disproportionately biased in his favour. While I know that there is obviously a distinct article on the bombing, it doesn't quite seem appropriate that the article about the guilty party is leaning heavily towards innocence. In light of the dropping of the appeal, it seems somewhat unlikely that he will be exhonerated, so it's not even as if Megrahi's status, in a legal sense, will alter (in terms of innocent vs guilty, rather than incarcerated vs free). I'm not sure what to do to alter the article, which is why I tagged it, to see if anyone else had any ideas. I accept entirely what you're saying, and I even agree, I just, like I said, find that focus disproportionate.   

This legal speak is very cautious. """"A miscarriage of justice could have occurred"""" means in reality that it is practically certain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. So, he is convicted, yes, but a mass murderer, no, the guilty party, no, most likely not. Concerning the future, nobody knows, but there remains a strong pressure to reopen the case.213.84.53.62  

My understanding of the legal status is that """"A miscarriage of justice could have occurred"""" does not, by any stretch, mean that the occurrence of such a miscarriage is """"practically certain.""""  If you have evidence to that effect, I would be happy to see it.  It only means that there is sufficient reason to justify the time and expense of further investigation.  We should also be wary of political pressures on the relevant actors in this case, coming from both directions, and to me this diminishes the weight of several quotations in favor of al-Megrahi; there was significant pressure on law enforcement agencies to put someone away for the Lockerbie bombing, and just as surely there was just as much pressure on Libya and its friends to exonerate him, due to the sanctions and damage to international reputation and etc.  This is why I think less weight should be given to quotations and more weight to the hard evidence. 

Perhaps the article would read a little less biased if it actually included some of the relevant points from the original case against him? It doesn't really tell a reader why he was convicted in the first place.-12.70.92.162  

I absolutely agree.  First, the weight of the evidence in favor of a conviction should be given.  The page says nothing about what he is accused of doing and why the judges reached the conclusion they did.  Second, even though reasons have been given to doubt the conviction, responses to those reasons should also be given.  Presumably those who remain convinced of al-Megrahi's guilt, especially those who were involved in the initial trial, have offered responses to the allegations of a miscarriage of justice.  Al-Megrahi was convicted; this much is fact.  Voices should be heard that believe the conviction was wrong, and voices should be heard that believe it was right.  It is partly the absence of this secondary response that gives the article a prejudiced feel to me.  

Having read the entire article, I must agree with Sky83 and 12.70.92.162. How many times is the phrase """"miscarriage of justice"""" used here? There is actually very little information provided to show a miscarriage of justice took place (One of Hans Koechler's reason for doubting the validity of the conviction: """"A retired Scottish police officer has signed a statement confirming that the evidence that found Al-Megrahi guilty was fabricated. The police chief, whose identity has not yet been revealed, testified “that the CIA planted the tiny fragment of circuit board crucial in convicting a Libyan” for the bombing of the Pan Am jet (Scotland on Sunday, 28 August 2005).""""

Actually, I much appreciate your help; those were good-faith attempts to improve balance. I thought that one candidate's high goal-setting should be balanced by another's, and I also felt that removing the """"unknown"""" made the purpose of moneybombing less Paul-centric. For instance, the Thompson bomb generated negative attention for a known candidate. I think Huckabee did well, Romney will announce something decent this weekend, and Kucinich will do well next weekend and (with Paul) get significant shared coverage. I would agree that technically the whole chain of custody Sugra to Lyman to boom is not as important; and maybe so with Nordstrom as well, though that depends on the whole of the article; but every WP article, when it has any ability to explain the who, what, where, and why of the origin of a word, does so. There is simply no fact dispute that anyone used """"moneybomb"""" as fundraiser before Elder did on 10/14; it's verified repeatedly; so what would be the problem?

Fenris has been at Gamefaqs for nearly 4 years, whereas I have only stumbled across Gamefaqs in early 2005. I have seen Fenriswolf's posts in the Asia and Japan regional boards, and from the nature of them he seems to be a loyal, unquestioned admirer of the Chinese communist government. Myself however, is an Australian citizen. Although I do not oppose the Chinese government, I support eventual democracy in China, and can at least acknowledges its negative aspects. If I was indeed a mindless follower of the Chinese government, then why didn't I remove entire sections of articles such as Falun Gong and Epoch Times regarding negative aspects of the government? I reverts some of TJive's edits due to his choice of wording, such as his insistance in calling certain governments """"regimes"""", and his tendency to edit without discussion, dismissing me as a stooge of the Chinese government on his user page.. If you look at my edit history, I do not delibrately start any vandalism or edit wars, and has contributed lots to science-fiction and videogame related articles.

IR Explanation

Blessed morning!

This email is regarding the IR issued for the call I received last October 7, 2010, BP Patrice McKenzie.

That afternoon, I was the only one on the queue and prior to Ms. McKenzie's call, I received a MVI call but MVI was not successful due to previous balance as well as the proof of residency required. And because I was the only one on the qeue, I wasn't able to log out or refresh my system.

During the call of Ms. Mckenzie, the POR pop box came and I informed the SME that time, Mario Raymundo, that I have not informed my customer because I know that it was system glitch. Also because tnere is no active account on the address. I was not the one who released the order but someone from Off Line Services. I endorsed the account to Mario to make necessary adjustments on the account. He texted me at around 1am to inform me that he had already talked to someone from OLS and that no POR is really required for the address so, it was released.

After receiving the QA score, I also sent an email to dispute the score that I got because I believe that I did not do anything that is not in accordance with the business rules.
Here are the reasons why:
1. I was the only agent in auto-in for 1hour and 30mins.
2. I informed my support about the situation and I was approved that there is not need to inform the customer of the POR.
3. There is no active account on the address.
4. I was not the one who released the order.

I don't know what adjustments would be made, but I hope there will be considerations.

Thank you!
God bless!

On sources, Amazon is a credible source for the topic in question, the relative contents of two books. The Twitter sources are necessary given that 1. Twitter is the topic being discussed (specifically: discussions on Twitter about the book), and 2. the issue is new and has not yet been written about in mainstream publications. These sources can be improved as additional information and media coverage becomes available which is likely given the high profile of the author, the ongoing media attention to the book, and the fact that The Circle will soon be released.

If it's easily verified, it shouldn't be hard to find secondary sources to support it.   

Agreed, that is a fair point, though it will only be easy to do so if sufficient time has passed for secondary sources to pick up on it which they haven't yet. It was only a matter of hours ago that the alleged victim of plagiarism was made aware of the details of the book in question (The Circle) and therefore able to point out the similarities. In the coming days it is likely to receive more attention. The female author in question has upward of 1,500 Twitter followers and a well-received book on Amazon and the other comments on Twitter corroborating her interpretation also come from prominent Tweeters. While I am a Wikipedia novice, it does not seem that this is an unusually suspect story to report in somewhat-real-time versus other pages that are rapidly updated, and to reiterate, it is very obvious from reading the respective Amazon pages that there are myriad similarities between the books and it is only a matter of time before this is picked up.

I see your edit was removed by a bot. I don't think it's impossible that there might surface secondary sources to support this part of the article, but these aren't them. Tweets are generally considered unsuitable, which is why bots remove them. And that Medium post isn't a suitable source either. 1) it's written by the person who is theoretically the aggrieved party in this case, 2) Medium is basically a self-publishing platform, like Livejournal, and doesn't really qualify as a secondary source, especially in the case of a potentially contentious allegation like this.   

Let's not let this plagiarism flap stand in the way of making this a better article.  It could use a lot of improvement.  My personal opinion is that the plagiarism claim (which amounts to """"I wrote a book about a woman hired by a social networking firm, and any similar books are plagiarism"""") should not be included in the article anyway, in the absence of a lawsuit or settlement.  So let's get some interesting stuff about the book in there.  For one thing, Margaret Atwood reviewed the book at length. 70.114.146.227  Eric""",0

 Identity of the designer 

The paragraph just above the heading """"Origins of the term"""" states:

""""Intelligent design deliberately does not try to identify or name the specific agent of creation — it merely states that one (or more) must exist. Although intelligent design itself does not name the designer, the personal view of many proponents is that the designer is the Christian god.[34][22][35] Whether this was a genuine feature of the concept or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design. The Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District court ruling held the latter to be the case.""""

The above statement contains a popular misconception about the identity of the designer. ID leaders have indeed named the designer. 

The article's reference #34 above is to Dembski's 1999 Touchstone article in which he says that """"intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory."""" When Dembski said that, he was identifying, indeed defining, the designer as not only God but Jesus Christ, to which """"Logos"""" refers in the Gospel of John, as Barbara Forrest points out on pp. 3-4 of her paper http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf.

See also the article's reference #142 at pp. 39-40 of """"Is It Science Yet? Intelligent Design Creationism and the Constitution,"""" at  http://law.wustl.edu/WULQ/83-1/p%201%20Brauer%20Forrest%20Gey%20book%20pages.pdf.  Note here also that Phillip Johnson also defines ID as requiring God when he defines it as """"theistic realism.""""

So it is clear that it is more than """"a personal view of many proponents"""" that the designer is the Christian God.   """,0

 POV  talk section moved 

POV

i've tried to clean things up a bit though someone else will have to remove the vandalistically applied christianity template lest i be reported for """"edit warring"""" by humus.   i've added a link to the christianity and judaism portals in the """"see also"""" section.   these links are more fitting than claiming this is """"part of the series on christianity""""

this article was very heavy on anti-jfj stuff.  a lengthy """"criticism"""" section as well as criticisms inserted into nearly every other section.  the missionaries are """"taught to speak in hebrew"""" (these people already went to hebrew school!) and jfj is known to """"target vulnerable jews"""" (oh really?) and """"most of the funding comes from christians"""" (well did we think it was coming from muslims and religious jews?) and the current leader """"is not jewish"""" (even though his mother, father, all grandparents were apparently jewish)

some of the criticisms' references were just opinion pieces from religious jews who oppose conversion.  most come from biased publications that don't meet wikipedia's reliable sources standards.  including these references is analogous to editing the """"buddhism"""" article to say that """"all buddhists will burn in hell"""" along with a reference to some fire-n-brimstone website.

anyway, if all we're trying to get across is that some, even many, jewish people and groups oppose jfj we don't need to spread it all over the article.  it isn't at all surprising that religious jews don't want other jews to accept jesus  every missionary movement is opposed by someone.

 

Friend, your edits pushed your delusion that J4J is just another Jewish denomination that a bunch of long-bearded Hassidim oppose. You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffles feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commies and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that """"NPOV"""" 

Thanks for the """"friend"""", nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not.   Please don't accuse me of """"pushing my delusions"""".   Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that """"all"""" """"mainstream"""" jewish groups, including """"secular"""" groups """"strongly"""" oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who """"all"""" the """"mainstream"""" jewish groups are, and what degree of """"opposition"""" is """"strong"""".  Can you really not see this simple truth?
Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism.  I outlined this above already.   Statements like j4j approachs """"vulnerable jews"""" are unabashedly POV  and tautological.  If anyone converts then its clear they were """"vulnerable"""" to conversion,  so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches """"vulnerable jews"""".
It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposes this conversion.  Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn?  Yes...but who cares?  Do drug smugglers """"strongly oppose"""" DEA agents coming along and busting up their operations?   Yes...but it would be silly to put it in an article.   Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying.   Still, I wouldn't be """"strongly opposed"""" to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same.
Compare this article to that of any other missionary group.   In the article """"christianity"""" is there a section labeled """"incompatibility with paganism"""" and """"a belief that is incompatible with paganism"""" and """"all pagan groups strongly oppose christianity""""?   Do we see """"incompatibility with catholicism"""" in the protestant article?   I know this analogy is not going to be satisfying, but no analogy is ever complete.
What are the further objections?   Yes, the group may be called """"Jews for Jesus"""" and that offends people, but what would you have them call themselves?   Would """"Jews that are now christians but still consider themselves jewish"""" be better?  They did use Jackie Mason in a pamphlet.   They also used Steve Jobs and Curious George, and a whole bunch of others, but i don't see Steve Jobs supporters here furious about Jews for jesus """"deceiving"""" ipod owners into believing in jesus.

 After editing nl:Martha Gellhorn, see the left side bar, (click """"Hulmpmiddelen"""",) and click """"Permanente Kooppeling"""". You can get the """"oldid=XXXXXXXX"""" of the page from the address bar.

 After editing Martha Gellhorn, see the left side bar, (click """"toolbox"""", and click """"Permanent link"""". You can get the """"oldid=YYYYYYYYYY"""" of the page from the address bar. 
 Third, you need announce in the article talk page(Talk:Martha Gellhorn) that you translated from the Dutch Wikipedia. You have to make a new section and place this Template:translated page, that is, {{translated page| nl | Martha Gellhorn | version = XXXXXXXX | insertversion = YYYYYYYYYY | section = ?Political and religious views }}.

"Several exting quaternary volcanoes are situated in the surroundings of the town Bruntál. Most of them belong to the group of mixed volcanoes, which means that the activity of the volcanoes was in turns explosive and extrusive. Lava was vomited during the surface in the shape of incoherent volvano eruptive rock. On the contrary by the extrusion lava was running out from the crater and formed the lava streams. The volcano eruptive rocks form mostly the volcano maar.

Velký Roudný / Big Roudný 780 m above sea and Malý Roudný / Small Roudný 771 m above sea

Velký Roudný (Big Roudný) is the highest volcano of the Low Jeseníky Mountains. This volcano was last active 1 – 2 milion years ago. 

Big a Small Roudný form two remarkable peaks above the village Roudno. From three lava streams of Big Roudný the northeaster one is the longest and the quarry for whinstone mining was made here. This lava stream dammed up the valley of the river Moravice in the place of todays Slezska Harta, so a great lake was formed. To which the eruptive rocks were falling. 
  
They created sediments of sponge puff-stones, which are today found in the surroundings of the villages Razová and Karlovec. These puff-stones were mined as a good building material. 
TABThe Bruntál volcanoes create a remarkable and striking feature of the Low Jeseniky Mountains countryside. 
Trip to Big Roudný

TABThe easier way to Big Roudný is from the going to Křištanovice. We will go along the guidepost from the upper crossing in Roudno. We are on the top in half an hour, where a big information board is placed and next to it there is a cone hollow, which is considered to be the rest of the crater. A rebuilt small chapel is placed on the top. Behind the chapel there are 15 pictures of the Station of the Cross on the stands. If we go downhill, we come to two stony mounds with a cross – to the victims of the 1st Word War in 1914 – 1918. More ambitous tourists can go down from the mound maybe 30m downhill to a visible road which goes out from the forest and go on along a meadow path at first to the southern direction and then turn down the way to the road to Bílčice.",0

A candidate, no matter how personally disgusting or devoid of decency, no matter how base or illegal his tactics, merely needs to promise to lower taxes and keep the Mexicans out in order to win.

My point is that if you're going to editorialize, it shouldn't be one sided.  He chooses to """"introduce"""" papers that are highly critical with his own commentary, but doesn't introduce papers where similarly relevant information makes cold fusion look bad.  The guy is spinning what should be plain original sources.  I don't know of any library or librarian that would modify original sources with their own comments.  I don't agree that /acrobat/ERABreportofth.pdf is """"moderate"""" - I consider it highly prejudicial to the paper that follows.  Some of it is just plain nitpicking (i.e. the throwaway use of """"simple"""") designed to make the authors look biased where there is no credible claim of bias from that particular passage. 

For these reasons I do not think it's appropriate to use lenr-canr to link the source of any paper.  In my opinion it's far better to not have the full source online than to have altered sources introduced with prejudice.  It's just a bad idea; it allows anyone to upload some source paper, add their own commentary to the lead and potentially tamper with other things, and use it as a source on Wikipedia instead of the typical and totally unbiased DOI links. 
 
Whether this justifies a blacklisting based on policy is another matter; it may not.  I'll take your word for the scope and purpose of the blacklist, in which I agree that blacklisting lenr-canr.org is extreme.  I'd agree that it certainly deserves a place in the external links section.   I've also found it invaluable for getting up to speed on various papers.  However, if blacklisting is the only way to stop this terribly biased source from being used as a reference, then I support it.    """,0

Hmmmm,

I believe that most of the American Churches have dropped the """"Mission"""" part of the title because it was simply was not true anymore. The name is probably still in use in Africa. Legally, most of our American churches go by """"Apostolic Faith Church,"""" with some churches adding the word Trinity to distinguish our organization from others. In regard to Joe Bishop's sermon on Biblical modesty, I thinkI'm fairly certainI know exactly which sermon you're talking about. I thoroughly enjoyed it myself. There are some copies floating around. I know a few people that have them.

You're absolutely rightmy age does limit my experience. But I think, to be fair, your experience limits your objectivity. A few people have asked me about this Wikipedia page, and my response to them has been along the lines of """"it doesn't really need that much fixing."""" I'm not interesting in changing the majority of what you've written. The only thing that concerns me
is the spin, the anti-AF opinion that runs through the factual accounts. Every historian operates through a unique lens of perspective, and the lens you're looking through is tainted by someI imaginevery painful experiences. 

I've had offers of help, and I've turned them down. Since the only work of note that I have really put into the article amounts to the altering or deletion of about six phrases, I didn't think it would be worth mustering the Apostolic Forces. It's not my place or desire to create an historical account for the world to look at. Perhaps this is laziness excused, but I feel that if the organization was concerned about the encyclopedic content available through Wikipediaand I think that it should besome committee or pastor or minister or historian should get on and take care of it. (Fact is, I'd guess that most of our AF leaders probably aren't aware of just how widely-spread Wikipedia is used, and if they did, they would probably do something about itif someone also told them they were allowed to. We're not exactly on the cutting edge of technology.) I'm sure that whatever I wrote, or however I wrote it, someone somewhere would disagree. Probably many someones. Which is another reason why I've greatly limited my input.

If I asked you to verify all your encyclopedic content, how much information would be left that isn't rooted in undocumentable or unverifiable personal experience? I think large portions would be missing from the """"church doctrines and teachings"""" sectionthough I did not delete them, because I know that, while not verifiable or encyclopedic, most of what has been written is factually accurate. Is that what Wikipedia is for, though? Unverifiable facts?

One last question, about the alteration you made to my alteration regarding dancing. What dancing are you referring to as being prohibited? Dancing privately? Slow-dancing in a ballroom? School dances? Because there are different attitudes regarding all of those, among many different people, and I'm not sure what you mean by """"dancing was prohibited through 2000."""" What kind, and by what verifiable source?

"Donald Campbell and File:Donald Campbell.jpg 

Hi Katie, I'd like to request an undelete on your recent deletion of this image (WP:CSD#F7). This is for two reasons:
 It's the masthead, and only, image of a biography on an important motorsport and motorboat figure. Our precedent is clearly that such images are considered to fall under fair-use. If the FUR wasn't up to scratch on the image, then WP:BEFORE clearly indicates that the FUR should be fixed, not the image deleted. I've seen an awful lot of these lately - images uploaded a few years ago (so probably the more important images) with FUR that was adequate at their time of upload are being purged because they don't meet todays practice, even though it's a trivial filing exercise to bring them up to standard. This hurts the encyclopedia project.
 Secondly, it wasn't notified anywhere on the article. There are templates for notifying this on the page, there's a talk: page too. Many people, myself included, have articles like this on their watch lists but we don't have every constituent image watched. Now whilst policy doesn't demand this, it would clearly be a helpful and appropriate action to place some notification onto the article, especially when it's the masthead that's under threat.

 Totally vandalized and requires a rewrite 

Well obviously this article over the past few days has been totally vandalized and stripped of its information.  Somebody tried to rewrite the entire, and what used to be complex and informative article quickly as nobody seems to have a saved copy of the article.  In need of some Wiki admins.  

Hello, Mehicdino! I'm not sure whether you're  (talk • contribs), who edited the article to """"remove immature/incorrect text"""". However, can either one of you be more specific with what is inaccurate? There was some vandalism in the previous weeks, which I had reverted already (all revisions of the page are stored automatically, and you can access them by clicking on the """"history"""" tab above and clicking on the date and time of the revision). Most everything in the article looks correct. Granted, I'm not an expert on this subject, but given that the revision only removed minimal details, which seem correct, and also removed many of the wikilinks, I've gone ahead and reverted back to the previous version for now. Can you clarify on what is incorrect? Thanks!  (A note?) 

 Vandalism should never require a rewrite, as it's very easy to revert to a previous version.  

No, I am not the IP you state I could be because it does not match mine.  I was just saying a few days ago somebody actually put much effort into vandalizing this article to a pile of rubbish.  

Thanks for the reply. I'm just making sure that there is nothing that is obviously inaccurate presently; I hope I took care of all the vandalism with the revert. Thanks!  (A note?) 

This still needs rewriting; what is this?!:
""""The Tennis Coart started in the late 1990's and ended in the early 1500's. It resulted in the parilization of the Queen of Scottland. It occured in Witchitah Maine.""""

 From WP:ANI 

Hi, all.  Now that I know that this discussion exists, I'd like to contribute.

I'll say three things briefly, then answer any questions.  First, I have no intention of making any phone calls in the future.  Second, I am absolutely certain that my actions in no way threatened the privacy of any editors and therefore was not an example of WP:OUT.  Third, please note the context of this accusation.   

 Ok, here's the context: your supporters feel that the phone call to someone's place of business does not belong in the RFC.  Fine then, based on the section of WP:NPA that I have quoted both in our discussion on my talkpage, and I believe I left it in the RFC, this is an issue that requires immediate intervention - if there is indeed action to be taken.  Indeed, when I became aware of the situation in the RFC, I should have brought it here myself.  You have had about a full day since the end of the interactions on my talkpage to reflect - based on the above, I'm not sure you used the time wisely. (talk→  ←track) 

A couple of weeks ago, I voluntarily revealed the fact that I did this research, while carefully avoiding any revelation of private information.  My motivation was to demonstrate that yet another checkuser conviction was mistaken.
Weeks passes without a whisper, until the now-departed User:Paularblaster digs it up to try to add substance to an unpersuasive RfC/CU that he and Schrandit launched.  There was no haste or cause for it, just an ax to grind.
Now, I said outright that I won't be doing this again, and whether or not you agree with the action, there was never any potential to harm anyone, much less an intent to do so.  All this talk about a """"chilling effect"""" is well-meaning but simply mistaken.  No matter how you add it up, the situation is one that requires calm reflection, not urgent action, because there's a risk of knee-jerk reaction without actually understanding what happened.
Now, I'm going to ask you, Bwilkins, the question you refused to answer before, and which you deleted from your talk page.  Bwilkins, how could my phone call have caused anyone to lose their job?   

(@ CarolineWH) Do you understand why we would be concerned with your off wiki sleuthing, and how that could have a chilling effect?  In other areas it would be bad enough, but considering that you are editing abortion-related articles (some of which likely document the murders or stalking of abortion providers) makes it more so.   

If there was ever any risk of private information being revealed, then I'd agree.  But there wasn't, so no, there is no chilling effect.  As for abortion, it's a red herring, as the two editors I researched had nothing to do with the issue.  I would add that this is not a matter of stalking someone I disagree with, but confirming that they were innocent of sockpuppetry.   

(ec):It was uncalled for sleuthing. You clearly indicate investigating the workplace of either Spotfixer or Phil Specter, even if it eventually didn't turn out to be their workplace. Had it happened to me, I would consider such intrusive investigations into my private life just to one-up me in a content dispute, harassment. Despite saying you won't make such phone calls in the future, I see no indication that you understand how serious and inappropriate it was.  

If I had determined that either of them were Spotfixer, I'd have bit my tongue to protect their privacy and allow RfCU to properly convinct them.  The scenario you described would indeed be chilling, but it has nothing to do with the reality of what I did.  Again, unless you can show how my actions were even potentially harmful, it's hard for me to consider them either serious or inappropriate.  I agreed not to do it again, but that doesn't mean that what I did was wrong.

I also think it's very important to keep to the issue of diacritical marks in the original orthography of the language, and not stray into either additional letters (like eth or thorn) or the use of diacritical marks in transcription/transliteration (like retaining accents when going from πότε to póte or marking long vowels by macrons in transliterating a number of languages, including Greek and Japanese). These are separate issues.

The problems, for me, are primarily in the first paragraph of WP:DIACRITICS, which is evasive, muddled and inconsistent:
 – this is just evasion. Their use or non-use should be motivated, and hence should be encouraged or discouraged according to the strength of the motivation.
 – this encouragement to count """"hits"""" just results in muddled policy, apart from the problem of the weasel word """"general"""". However, this bit seems clear that the """"modifications"""" are to the same word, i.e. can be treated as stylistic modifications.
 This seems to me not to be consistent with the sentence before: is """"the common name"""" here supposed to be with or without the added diacritical marks? """"[V]ersions of  word"""" above should mean that """"the common """" is the same with or without the diacritical marks.
Is it possible to re-write this paragraph to achieve consensus? I don't know.   

 Agreed those are separate issuesAgreed the first quoted passage is evasive, but motivating use or avoidance of diacritics seems to be the sticking point.  Did you have some particular direction in mind?  My take has been that if reliable sources show that their use is normal for the names in question that they should be used here, except where particular subjects eschew them. E.g. for a baseball player named Eddie Sandoval we'd give him as Eddie Sándoval if some reliable sources did (it can't be based on a majority of English language sources, since majority of them ignore diacritics entirely, as a matter of editorial/publishing convenience). It's the same principle that we can cite a single source for Eddie's birth date and place even if most sources don't mention them.  A fact does not have to be provided by every single source to be considered reliable.  And it's not a matter of sources conflicting (analogous to giving two different birth dates); some giving only Sandoval without the diacritics is like some sources giving a birth year but not a full birth date; it is incomplete information, not conflicting information.  On the other hand, if Eddie himself is quoted saying he doesn't use the diacritic that should be a trumping factor (unless WP totally ditches subject preference in all areas, which seems unlikely given the number of discussions going on to make more allowances for subject preference all over the place).  This can apply to geography, too (Santa Fe, New Mexico is """"Santa Fe"""" not """"Santa Fé"""" despite the popularity of the diacritic in certain circles; the official name of both the city and the county are """"Santa Fe"""" with no accent. People frequently cite WP:OFFICIALNAME as if it were a policy, but it's actually just an essay, it may not accurately reflect the nuances in cases like this, and people often cite it without actually understanding what it says to begin with (it's frequently misinterpreted as being against use of official names, when it's really only against using them when they're directly unhelpful to readers, while otherwise we would almost certainly use the official name)I'm not sure """"general"""" in the second passage is actually a weasel word, rather than just lack of clarity.  It's not clear if it means the predominant use in reliable sources generally, the predominant use in general-audience sources, or both.  The inclusion of """"and reference works"""" strongly suggests the former.  Regardless, the """"hit-counting"""" aspect is a problem because of the aforementioned facts that a) English-language sources tend to ignore diacritics for their own conven",0

About GUSAC
by G U S A C - Gitam University Science and Activity Centre on Tuesday, August 16, 2011 at 2:54pm ·
GITAM University Science and Activity Center
 
The GUSAC team is privileged to invite the students across the GITAM University.
After several untiring efforts we have been finally successful in launching a
Science and Activity Center at GITAM University.
 
 
MOTTO: 
 
 “ It’s not what you know, It’s what you do with what you know” .
 
     Our main objective is to integrate knowledge and transfer the same to students.GUSAC will provide an exclusive platform to the """"Budding Future"""" by nourishing their creativity. It will unleash the genius with in them and capacitate them to implement their ideas to the in numerous problems arising in the world.
 
     A fresher aims to attain his/her goals during his/her tenure in the university. GUSAC provides a scope for students like these by imparting knowledge through classes,friendly seminars, practical assignments....., it also enables them to build a team for participating in fests  and assists them with the required infrastructure to make their projects, besides creating a platform for the student research.
 
Benefits of GUSAC:
 
It creates an environment for interested students to evenly space out and implement their ideas.
Many students who have potential and are interested in participating in various events fail to do the same may be due to lack of proper inter-departmental knowledge and freedom to put forth their ideas. This center fill these gaps and provide better prospects for the students of GU.
Students will be exposed to national level competitions and are provided with a platform to put forth their projects and to gain recognition for their work.
Most of the projects aimed at will be targeted towards nation-building, to help the needy and the disabled.
Seeing the benefits of GUSAC, here is a tentative curriculum on how GUSAC moves forward:
 
GUSAC will  be administered in the following manner:
 
Step 1: All the students are free to enroll into GUSAC by giving names into database and will be accessible to weekend classes, friendly seminars and practical assignments.
Step 2: The students who are regular to the weekly classes with their active involvement towards GUSAC will be shifted to this step based on a small essay or a video on """"why should they be selected into step-2"""". In step 2 the student is free to access the GUSAC labs and to use the equipments as well.
Step 3: Eligible students of second year (sophomores) will be placed in a semi-core group and will contribute to the decision making process of GUSAC.
Step 4: Eligible students of third year (juniors) will be placed in sub-core and will have higher powers than semi-core.
Step 5: Eligible students of final year (seniors) will be in the core group. They will co-ordinate all the events of GUSAC and will play a crucial role in the decision making process of GUSAC.
 
The students will be given weekly assignments which will make them think out of the box and students who win will be awarded in an interesting way. The freshers can gain extra knowledge and make use of this to innovate projects using their time productively.
 
 
Stepping Stones to Success:
A student gathering will take place every week to discuss their interests and recent trends in Management, Science and Technology.
Students will work on their projects and ideas with freedom and utilities.
Experienced students will give lectures and problem statements will be given to students as practical assignments to keep enhancing their engineering skills.
Events like expos, seminars, fests and workshops will be conducted on a regular basis and representatives from the industry as well as academic circles  like IIT’s  will be invited to these events.
Faculty members who are interested in sharing their knowledge will always be welcome to do so in any of the aforementioned events and gatherings.
Students will be informed about the fests, events, industrial visits, internships to retain the practical approach of curriculum.
The center will be visiting schools nearby to have  chalk talks with the kids and also will give them a privilege to showcase their ideas. The interested one's will be called upon to the university to have a look at our projects and ideas.
 
If the chords of ingenuity have struck right, why not unearth the Einstein with in you???
 
@ GITAM STUDENTS  why late, get yourself enrolled in GUSAC and  scale heights in the world of emerging trends.""",0

Anons concerns cont'd

On the grav-locked, red dwarf planet:

Note that a planet gravitationally locked to its star will have tidal heating like Io, so it's not as if everything will freeze on the night side. The great advantage of a grav-locked planet is its stability. I think it's fair to say that stability is easier for life to deal with than instability. If you look at the stability of Jupiter's great red spot (400 years and posited to be permanent), weather on a grav-locked planet should be relatively stable, I presume a convection rising at the """"sun pole"""" and falling at the """"dark pole"""", with terrain eddies, of course. Such a planet will have no axial tilt, no day/night cycleI don't even think it can have an eccentric orbit, but I'm unsure. This greatly reduces the complexity of an organism's job: for example a plant doesn't need the night """"mode"""" earth plants need; they would not have to drop leaves for winter. These seem like advantages to me.

Based on the best information I can find on the US Dept. of Energy site (solar information), what plants get on a clear equinox day is about 8 kWH/m^2, peaking at 1 kW/m^2. The vast majority of that power comes in the middle 8 hours, less than 1 kWH/m^2 is in morning and evening. The night is essentially 0 kWH/m^2not absolutely, no, but to the 2 digit accuracy I was using, yes. (Compare visual magnitudes of sun vs. moon.) This varies by latitude and season, of course. Now let's plug this into the supposedly horrible 60-200% variation of a red dwarf. Instead of roughly 1/3 time at 1 kW (yes, it really is close to that), equivalent energy would be all the time at 1/3 kW. Thus, the variation would be 1/5 kW during minimums (=60% of 1/3 kW) and, of course, 200% is 2/3 kW. Thus, ignoring frequency, the red dwarf plant has an easier time. The lower power of red dwarfs just pull the HZ in. Considering Earth shade plants, which live on far less than 1 kW/m^2, the HZ is where the total solar and gravitational energy are right for water.

Organizationally, perhaps the best thing would be to treat Earth-like planets in the main flow of the article: then discuss tidally-locked red dwarf planets, with a note that thinking on the issue is in flux; and note that chemosynthsis biospheres would be possible even around brown dwarfs or outlying moons, like Titan and Europa. Perhaps (keeping original numbers):

1 Suitable star systems

 1.1 Spectral class
 3.1 Binary systems (since all but the closest binaries are ok, put it here)
 1.2 A stable habitable zone

2 Planetary characteristics

 2.1 Mass
 1.3/2.2 Acceptable energy variation (as I hope I showed about, """"low"""" isn't really necessary; include the case of Jovian moons in the HZ)
 1.4 High metallicity (it comes from system formation but it's a planet property)
 2.3 Geochemistry (maybe combine with metallicity?)

3 Alternative biologies
 3.2 Red dwarf systems (tidally locked; low light?)
 NEW Chemosynthesis-based biology.

4 on, no changes.

I should add, this is a really good article. Maybe I'm trying to gild the lily.

 Mistake ? 
I am not a specialist but """"Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere [10]."""" (mass paragraph) seems doubtful to me. I mean, Mars still has volcanoes (Mount Olympus for example) so it sees strange to me that it's geologically dead, but once again I am no specialist.  

Mars does have volcanoes, but as far as I know, they're not really active, so nothing is really """"powering them"""" and geological activity isn't really showing up.   
Luna, Earth's Moon has volcanoes, and it's accepted as geologically dead. The presence of volcanoes doesn't mean ACTIVE volcanoes. 
That's basically what I was trying to say, I guess I just never made it really clear.  

 Picture Size 
Can a larger size by found for the Habitability Zone picture? I'd like to use it as a background, but it won't scale up. 

I downloaded it here:  http://library.thinkquest.org though I can't remember the exact spot on the site. An image search for habitable zone turns it up first thing, but only at 19k...  

Earth's geological activity
I am pretty sure that the earth isn't geologically active simply because of its large mass/surface area ratio. From what I have read, I believe that planets are probably heated mostly by radioactive decay, and/or tidal for",0

66.185.85.80's rant

Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as """"primitive"""" and """"rural"""" (even """"fashist"""") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, """"performed"""" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.
 
Another """"apostle"""" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as """"gusle players"""". 

Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book """"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"""", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. 
 
Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  

In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. 

Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. 

The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  """"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"""" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)

This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)

Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. 

Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",0

1820 Map vs Globe
The image in the infobox should be a geographic locator as well, showing where the state is within a larger context of the world.
It doesn't seem consistent with map of other Chinese dynasty articles (e.g. Ming, Tang, etc). Geographic locator map is mainly used for current country map (not historical map), e.g. People's Republic of China, United States, etc   
The Qing Dynasty, although is a dynasty of the past, is also largely a modern political entity, and its history is intertwined with modern world history.  That's why I think a geographic locator is better suited, as it also mirrors the Republic of China (1912-1949) article.  Another thing to consider is that because there are so many contemporaneous maps of the Qing that's available (where as such maps are rare for prior historic dynasties, such as Ming and Tang), it is difficult to choose one that truly represent the whole article in the infobox.  

I agree that showing all the different maps of the Qing Dynasty at its various extent and time periods is informative to readers, but they don't have to be in the infobox; a general geographic locator is a good fit there.

 Equal Standards 
TheLeopard, I thank your for your unending quest for the truth, and your campaigning for the integrity of Wikipedia. However, there are other areas of Wikipedia that would greatly profit from similar vigor. Take for instance the previously widely unknown National Capital Region (China). You rescued it from obscurity caused by a redirect. However, it must have escaped you that this article does not contain a single reference, and that there are several claims and outright speculations that deserve at least a dubious tag. A National Capital Region (China) is worthy of the same attention to detail as China’s capital, or other cities such as Shanghai. While it is the job of the author to provide these references (lest the author would risk a deletion), the lack of verifiable sources should at least have been pointed out. I have done so in the meantime. Thank you   
The only reason I rescued that article was because it was redirected to Bohai Economic Rim, which clearly is not the same thing as National Capital Region.  The article needs to be tagged with """"unreferenced"""" and a bunch of other tags.

 You are now a Reviewer 

Hello. Your account has been granted the """"reviewer"""" userright, allowing you to review other users' edits on certain flagged pages. Pending changes, also known as flagged protection, is currently undergoing a two-month trial scheduled to end 15 August 2010.

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not autoconfirmed to articles placed under pending changes. Pending changes is applied to only a small number of articles, similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. The list of articles with pending changes awaiting review is located at Special:OldReviewedPages.

When reviewing, edits should be accepted if they are not obvious vandalism or BLP violations, and not clearly problematic in light of the reason given for protection (see Wikipedia:Reviewing process). More detailed documentation and guidelines can be found here.

If you do not want this userright, you may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time.

Why is """"See also contemporary artists collective - www.changelings.com.au"""" included in the body of the article? Shouldn't it be in external links?  

I reorganized the page, the intro was way too long.  I promise I DID NOT remove or change ANY information, but merely reorganized the format.  I hope no one is offended.   

Consider adding Keith Donohue's The Stolen Child to the literature listing.

What about the tales of the faery replacing infants with elderly and ailing faeries, so that the changeling child soon sickens and dies? This is the version I’ve heard most often and it’s also been posited that this form of the changeling myth was an early explanation for cot death or SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). 

one wonders why they steal babes, if it doesn't work out anyway?
 13:09, Mar 15, 2004 (UTC)

I guess the reason is that our ancestors considered children born with Down's syndrome to be changelings. In this way changelings were a reality and the possibility of having one's child replaced was something that instilled fear. I know from the rural area in south central Sweden, where I grew up, that there was once a """"changeling"""" in the neighbourhood who lived to an old age. Children have always been born with Down's syndrome and people needed a name for it.  10:56, Mar 25, 2004 (CET)
I've heard that one reason trolls want to trade children is because they want the troll child to have a proper upbringing.  06:28, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)
In my experience from reading Scandinavian fairy tales for my daughter, the main reason is jealousy. In the fairy tales, the trolls are dark and swarthy and are fond of the blond beauty of human infants. 21:55, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)
In the story """"The Corpse"""" from Mike Mignola's Hellboy, it is suggested that the Fair Folk, for an unexplained reason, can no longer reproduce, and thus must take human children and raise them.  It is implied that a child raised among the Fair Folk from infancy would become one of them.
I'm going to add """"The Corpse"""" to the list of references to Changelings in literature as well.

 Cecil Grace in Wright Aeroplane Startles Naval Officers at Sheerness

1 May 1910

FLIES OVER BRITISH FLEET

Cecil Grace in Wright Aeroplane Startles Naval Officers at Sheerness

London, April 30. The fleet of British warships anchored off Sheerness had a novel experience to-day when an aeroplane from the Aero Club aviation grounds as East Church  (Eastchurch) suddenly appeared out of the haze and manoeuvred over the vessels at varying heights. After making a deliberate reconnaisance the aerial craft disappeared from view.
The aeroplane which startled the navy officers is a Wright model and was piloted by Cecil Grace. After leaving the harbor it flew nearly fifty miles in fifty-one minutes, rising at one time to a height of 1,500 feet.

East Church, containing the Royal Aero Club's aviation grounds, is on the Isle of Sheppey. Mr. Grace has been flying for some time, and his operations have attracted considerable attention. He uses a Short-Wright biplane. Last month while manoeuvring he fell from a considerable height, but received only a few scratches. His machine was damaged, but not beyond easy repair.""""""",0

"I've had a quick look, it's certainly a major improvement. Although 10 years old I think it would be better to use the 2001 census figures for population with an explanation that this is likely to have risen to the 2009 mid year estimates. The stats in the table seem to be a mixture of the 2001 census and more recent estimates, and a source next the every figure in the table seems a bit overkill and a little distracting - would it be better to just use the 2001 census and have one reference at the top of each column (similar to the Somerset table)?

User:JimWae, the part your assessment relevant to my compromise version, is for the most part, incorrect, and furthermore, you have acknowledged that you do not have references that support your claims. If you looked at the references that qualified the statement regarding the """"propagating atheism,"""" you would find that it is a factual statement. And once again, this article is not about state atheism exclusively, but about the ideology of militant atheism, which was applied to some atheist states; an atheist state could exist, without promoting militant atheism. Your version of the introduction eliminates defining the ideology of militant atheism as given by several references and summarized in the Concepts section of the article; the lede should define the ideology and then talk about its Application, which parallels the structure of the article, namely the headings listed in the article's table of contents. Furthermore, contrary to your opinion, militant atheism is an integral part of Marxism-Leninism, as supported by the consequent references. For example, Faith and Order: The Reconciliation of Law and Religion, specifically states:  When discussing content, you must keep in mind WP:RS, rather than your original research. You assert that many people do not know about the Cultural Revolution and for this reason, it should be removed from the paragraph. That argument does not hold any water whatsoever, as this is an encylopædia. Moreover, removing the information on the concept of militant atheism, the Cultural Revolution, French Revolution, and political thinkers, violates WP:LEDE, which states """"The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article."""" Your revision of the introduction fails to do this. If the term """"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution"""" is not as common, however, I would not mind compromising and changing it to just """"Cultural Revolution.""""

Should the British EngD be mentioned in the article as a """"professional doctorate"""" ?

A few English universities now offer the degree of """"Doctor of Engineering"""" (EngD), which, like the PhD, is also a research-based degree, but differs from the traditional UK PhD in several important ways. Specifically,

1) A PhD degree is normally pursued full-time by a student while in residence in a university department under the supervision of a faculty member. Accordingly, PhD-level research is more speculative/abstract in nature, with an emphasis on producing results that may be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and are of academic interest. 

2) The EngD on the other hand is normally pursued by a candidate while he/she works as an employee in an outside company. Most EngD research is carried out in a designated industry (as opposed to a university department or lab) and is jointly supervised by both an industrial and a university supervisor. Accordingly, EngD-level research tends to be application-oriented in nature and designed to meet the specific needs/interests of the industrial sponsor. EngD candidates are still required to produce original research that makes a significant contribution to existing knowledge on his/her field, but, in many programmes (AmEng """"programs""""), it is customary for EngD candidates to submit a portfolio of engineering projects in lieu of a longer monographic thesis to fulfil (AmEng """"fulfill"""") the requirements for the degree.

3) EngD programmes normally include a more formal coursework requirement than the traditional English PhD. It should be stressed however that many engineering departments in the UK (e.g. at Cambridge) now require that PhD students take lecture courses and their associated written exams in their first year in the programme. 

4) (POV) No matter what the Research Councils say, the EngD is still generally seen in academic circles as inferior to a PhD. For example, I doubt an EngD would be acceptable as a qualification for appointment as a Lecturer in a university, whereas the PhD of course is the standard qualification in England for an entry-level faculty position. 

Because of its industry-oriented nature, the EngD is normally referred to in English academic circles as a """"professional degree"""", even though it remains a research degree as emphasized above
(there are no """"professional doctorates"""" awarded in the UK by coursework only like the American J.D for example). 161.24.19.112  """,0

 I do not find it trivial at all. I take offense when a great person is commonly known by a bad name. It is, without a doubt, a name with violates NPOV and is common. Ivan the Terrible is the common name for Ivan IV of Russia, but the wiki article is Ivan IV. No one is going to try to tell me that Ivan the Terrible isn't the more well known name. You are being insulting by calling it a """"supposed"""" POV issue, since it certainly does respect POV with respect to the person himself, and to non-Christians over the world (which are the majority, even if not the majority of English speakers). I can not demonstrate that another name is more common. What is the common name for homosexuals in America today? I won't sully this thread by mentioning it, by you can bet your bottom dollar (ooh, bad pun) that the wikipedia article isn't named that.

Francis, Of course I am open to the consensus of the group (any actual trads involved?).  However, I think your argument is misplaced. Mainstream Roman Catholicism at this time includes a broad cross-section of people with a wide variety of commitment levels, and yet all are considered """"Catholic"""", so I do not think that one can simply compare trads in general with a subset of mainstream Catholics, which we might, for convenience, term """"hardcore.""""  In any event, my vision for this article in general, and for this section in particular, is to present an accurate picture of the persons discussed, who are traditional, or traditionalist Catholics.  Given that, it obvious that some things which are identified with them, such as praying the Rosary frequently or going to Confession often, will also be found among some, more commited, more devout mainstream Catholics.  To address your concerns, I am open to acknowledging in the article that this overlap exists.  However, I think that removing any reference in this article, in this section, to recitation of the Rosary is selling both somewhat short.  There are other things, as well, which could be added, such as a preference for homeschooling (which, again, would not be confined to trads, or even Catholics, but which, I would think, would correlate highly with a traditionalist position.

Any listed citation that isn't currently a broken link pertains only to the animated version of the series.  Since there is so much contention over the series' origins and initial publication, all statements referring to either of those things should be removed until they can be reliably sourced.  The info can always be added back later.  Hopefully we can all take for granted that the Korean manhwa author (which is his profession, not a statement about the origins of this particular work) originally wrote the work in Korea.

 Response to Your defence of LGagnon. 

Please check appropriate, relevant and significant details before you post messages to the contrary at my User Page. That should be a basic minimum for any Administrator, I should think.

At the Ayn Rand Talk Page you will find evidence of my attempts to talk to Lgagnon. Just infra I post here a copy of my Memo to the Wikipedia Board articulating my frustration in this regard.

Sir(s)/Madam(Mesdames):

I continue to have problems with LGagnon at Wikipedia. He sends me the most ill-written messages. It is almost impossible to wade through the bad grammar, misspellings/typos; etc to get his point. He indulges the most foul personal attacks with regard to everyone, even Wikipedia admins, referring to the latter as """"vandal-coddling."""" He never backs up his unthinking assertions. He simply asserts.

Why does Wikipedia continue to indulge one  but one  lamentably under-educated vulgarian in this regard, to this degree? What could possibly be the explanation????!!!!!!!!

Please, Please, Please respond. I have tried to reason with the lad. I tried humour. I have issued warning after warning. He is as osmotically impervious to the ratiocinative as he is to any other recognizably human mode of intervention.

Panjab castes by Sir Denzil Ibbetson (http://www.archive.org/stream/panjabcastes00ibbe#page/n7/mode/2up)

On Page 269, the author writes: """"Similarly, if the Ramdasias do not follow the occupation of Chamars, it is no reason to separate them from that castes. So if a Ramdasia is Julaha, that is a weaver, and if he is 'Bazzaz' that is a draper, his caste remains unchanged. If a Chamar, a leather-worker becomes a Sikh and receives 'pahul' to-day, he at once joins the Ramdasias. The Ramdasias do receive the daughters in marriage of ordinary Chamars, but give them 'pahul' before associating with them"""".........""""The the Ramdasi is still a Chamar"""". 

On page 300, the author writes: """"The Sikh Chamar or Ramdasia. — It will be seen from Table VIII A that in the north and centre of the Eastern Plains a very considerable number of Chamiirs have embraced the Sikh religion. These men are called Ramdasia after Gui-u Ram Das, though what connection they have with him I have been unable to discover. Perhaps he was the first Guru to admit Chamars to the religion. Many, perhaps most of the Ramdasia Chamars have abandoned leather-work for the loom ; they do not eat carrion, and they occupy a much higher position than the Hindu Chamars, though they are not admitted to religious equality by the other Sikhs. The Ramdasia are often confused with the Raidiisi oi Rabdasi Chamars. The former are true Sikhs, and take the pdhul. The latter are Hindus, or if Sikhs, only Nanakpanthi Sikhs and do not take the pcikul ; and are followers of Bhagat Rav Das or Rab Das, himself a Chamar. They are apparently as true Hindus as any Chamars can be, and are wrongly called Sikhs by confusion with the Ranidasias"""".

 Proposed change to lede 

The current lede states that """" Thermal expansion, which is well-quantified, is currently the primary contributor to sea level rise and is expected to be the primary contributor over the course of the next century.""""

However, while thermal expansion is expected to contribute more than half the increase in the coming century, it isn't the primary contributor currently.

From AR4 page 409, """"Thermal expansion is projected
to contribute more than half of the average rise,..."""" but """"During recent years (1993–2003), for which the observing system is much better, thermal expansion and melting of land ice each account for about half of the observed sea level rise,""""

I propose the following replacement sentence:
At the end of the 20th century, thermal expansion and melting of land ice contributed roughly equally to sea level rise, while thermal expansion is expected to contribute more than half the rise in the upcoming century.

I also intent to remove the subsequent sentence, """"Glacial contributions to sea-level rise are less important, and are more difficult to predict and quantify"""" as it is no longer needed. 

Current footnote 8 doesn't support the claim, or at least I couldn't find it as it is the AR4 chapter on Climate models, not the chapter on Sea Level. I will add the reference to the Sea Level chapter

Opening Bias 

In the opening segment (If that's what you call it - I mean the first content, before the table of contents), there is the following paragraph:

The conflict killed at least 1,200 people, mostly Lebanese citizens,[38][39][40] severely damaged Lebanese civil infrastructure, and displaced approximately one million Lebanese[41] and 300,000–500,000 Israelis.[26][42][43] After the ceasefire, some parts of southern Lebanon remained uninhabitable due to Israeli unexploded cluster bomblets.[44]

It is blatantly obvious how anti-Israeli this paragraph is. The information might be true, and there is some doubt as to whether it actually is, but the way in which it is organized, especially in the opening segment, is ridiculously biased. A reader would probably read it whilst skimming the article, as it is the shortest paragraph in the opening segment, and then get the following information: Israel killed many Lebanese citizens; Lebanese civil infrastructure, which means hospitals, roads, etc., was destroyed by Israel, Israel displaced twice as much Lebanese civilians, and they used cluster bombs which render some Lebanese area uninhabitable.

Completely biased. Completely anti-Israeli. Completely ridiculous. Completely unacceptable of a Wikipedia article, especially a """"good"""" article.

I recommend either changing the wording (Maybe removing 'mostly Lebanese citizens', 'Lebanese', and changing it to approximately 1.5 million people displaced, as well as completely omitting the last sentence). The entire paragraph could be removed entirely, with some of the more important information being integrated to other paragraphs.

I would also ask Jack why he is asking user Rockpocket to mediate or intervene, perhaps he feels that user will be more likely to agree to his point of view, given his statement(not that I would suggest an Admin would be non-neutral):

""""Being a big sports fan, I developed an affinity for both Celtic and Hibernian.""""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARockpocket&action;=historysubmit&diff;=363834383&oldid;=361889637  

I would ask Jack if this his idea of nPov ? So far, all who have opposed editing the section have affiliations with Celtic, this will be apparent to any truly neutral observers. Reverting edits is the only course of action open to those of us who feel the section is in error. I would urge anyone who feels the same to edit the page to more accurately reflect the truth of the matter, until the matter is resolved.

The simple answer is...
Mostly Southern (call it 80/20), but with some Midwestern traits. 
For example, Kentucky's hilly topography with many streams and rivers are typical of the South, but the """"United We Stand Divided We Fall"""" motto is totally opposite of most """"State's rights"""" mottos in the South.  Economically we area somewhere in between, having a better economy and population growth than most Midwestern states, but still behind true sunbelt states like Georgia, Tennessee or the Carolinas.

As For Louisville,I think that the """"old stock"""" native Louisvillians are  midwestern in accent and attitude, but Jefferson's County nearly doubled it's population from 1940-1960 with people mostly from south central and western Kentucky which really altered the culture.

 What are you talking about? What you did is the fill-in-the-blank question:
Gusuku ... often refers to castles or fortresses in ______ that feature stone walls.
 And your answer is """"the Ryukyu Islands."""" That's wrong in the sense that we wouldn't say, """"We speak Germanic"""" when we actually speak English. Castles or fortresses that feature stone walls are typical of Okinawa. Applying the term to other island groups is highly problematic to say the least.
 Narratives about gusuku are truly chaotic. No wonder you don't understand the situation correctly. No one can define the meaning of gusuku, which reminds me of family resemblance. What's why I avoided the """"A is B"""" definition and used """"A often refers to B"""" in the article. Explaining many conflicting theories as I did in the article is confusing. So I present just one hypothesis which I personally support:
 The word gusuku originally meant stone walls that, say, partitioned agricultural fields. In other words, the word gusuku was not associated with castles. This meaning survives in Yaeyama.
 There has been a long tradition of mountain cult. At first, the word gusuku was not associated with mountain cult.
 In Amami, medieval mountain fortifications, that are typical of mainland Japan, were constructed, probably in response to Ryūkyū's repeated invasions. At this stage, the word gusuku was not associated with these mountain fortifications.
 In Okinawa, some sacred mountains were later fortified with stone walls. One consequence of the fusion of mountain cult and fortification was the association of the word gusuku with mountain cult and/or fortification. The association of gusuku with stonework was weakened, but anyway Okinawa's castles and fortresses had stone walls.
 Ryūkyū finally conquered Amami and introduced the noro ritual system to Amami. The new meanings of gusuku (1. related to mountain cult, 2. fortification) were also introduced to Amami. Most of the former medieval mountain fortifications were abandoned, but some were transformed into sacred places and given the name of gusuku even though they lacked stone walls. Some people of Amami might have interpreted the word gusuku as fortifications regardless of whether they had stone walls. Others reinterpreted the word as a sacred place regardless of whether it had stone walls. For this reason, some gusuku are on sand dunes, on cliff edges, and in caves.
 Archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture re-used the word gusuku as a technical term (yet another meaning). This was the source of confusion. They referred to Okinawa's castles and fortresses that feature stone walls as gusuku. They met fierce oppositions from folklorists because their use of gusuku was not grounded in people's actual usages.
 Some archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture attempted to extend the gusuku-as-fortifications framework to Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama, regardless of whether local people referred to the target as gusuku (The remains of human settlements of Yaeyama are not called gusuku by local people either). They met fierce oppositions not only from folklorists but also from fellow archaeologists.
 It is convenient to consider a dichotomy between inductive and deductive reasoning. Linguists, folklorists and ethnologists base their arguments on people's actual usages and try to infer a generalized conclusion from them. By contrast, archaeologists often define a term, independently of people's actual usages, and apply it to those which meet the definition. Due to lack of written materials, archaeologists need to name archaeological findings by themselves. So they naturally clash with scholars from other disciplines.
 It is important to note that the gusuku-as-fortifications framework (that's what the lead sentence says) is no longer supported in the archaeology of the Amami Islands. The renaming of so-called """"Uragami Gusuku"""" was a symbolic event. A gusuku is a gusuku only because people refer to it as such. It's not because the referent meets some definition. In Amami, gusuku (as a technical term) is dead, long live gusuku (as to people's actual usages)!   """,0

"(undent) This was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page.  See Archive 9.  The consensus was that Hagee is covered adequately in John McCain presidential campaign, 2008. Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.  Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his Vietnam service before the shoot-down, or more on McCain-Feingold, or more on his relations with the Republican Party in the early 2000s, as compared to more about Hagee.",0

None of this can be done if the terminology is not precisely defined.  My personal opinion is (and I have a degree in this field) is that we have the paranoid-delusional theorists arguing with the regular-delusional counter-theorists.  

Let us step back and neutrally state the facts.  If you are on one of the other sides of 'the coin', we need to talk about POV. The topic of my research CBW is difficult to approach without those one the other sides of this 'coin' accusing my of being on the opposing side.  I am afraid to state the known historical facts because but each side believes my idea is the POV of the other.

 Fred Meyer: Reversion 

I was asked to explain my reversion of your addition to the Fred Meyer article. That addition was composed of four parts. 
First, you claimed Fred G. Meyer to be a member of the Rosicrucian Order etc., providing sources. I won't discuss the validity of the sources here, but that clearly concerns Fred G. Meyer himself, not the stores, unless you can provide a source that states his business was influenced by his philosophical leanings. 
Next, you elaborated on the rosicrucian connection to Hitler. As far as I can see, the main connection to Fred Meyer was that both Nazism and the stores use the colours red, white and black, which is a rather weak link. No source was provided that the store logo may have been influenced by its Founder's rosicrucian connections. Hitler's connection to the rosicrucians was sourced (again I won't discuss the quality of the sources), but was unrelated to the stores. 
Thirdly, you claimed that the layout of racks gives a swastika and that green freight carts are nicknamed """"U-Boats"""", but this, the part most relevant for the stores, was still unsourced. 
Finally, the """"Notes"""" part could have been more fitting for the talk page, but definitely does not belong into the article proper.
Thus, your additions were either unrelated to the stores or unsourced. By the way, the version where you described your addition as """"your research"""" shows another problem: Even if it is true, original research is in principle unsuited for Wikipedia.

. Ive ask the WP:RD, it's all  who is dowloading me those informations. I don't expect any sunlight to go to Uranus and Neptune, so the best term to say the sky is black. How you know Uranus and neptune is not that pitch-black-dark. On Mars I was learnt to not notice the orange color. I've ask the WP:RD, it's what SteveBaker said. I beleive and let's hope SB is doing a good job giving me accurate informations.69.228.145.50  
Greetings.  As I indicated in the edit summaries, some of your statements are totally incorrect; this casts doubt on the accuracy of your edits generally.  In several places you removed clear existing text and replaced it with confusing, even incoherent or unrelated statements.  Sub-standard English is a large part of the problem.  It might be best if you had someone check your grammar and spelling prior to editing articles, rather than work on Wikipedia alone.    

Please keep in mind that substantial changes should be sourced, regardless of who is giving you information.  Be careful not to add (or substitute) information that represents original research.  Also, you might want to read WP:FIVE as a basic introduction to Wikipedia policies.   

How you explain  and . You said my information I add to Uranus and Neptune is not right. The sunlight on Uranus and Neptune is like 50 to 100 feet away from candle, 400 and 900 times dimmer sunlight. O my god, that's alot . It's like total blackness a dark swirling mass is below my feet in orbit. That's like a candle light halfway down my high school campus. I hadn't found any information about uranus and Neptune's total blackness69.228.145.50  
I do not think you have read what I wrote above, or studied the policy pages I linked to.  If you intend to edit Wikipedia articles, be prepared to provide reliable sourcing, not information from the reference desk, or your own interpretations.  It is clear you are learning the fundamentals of astronomy for the first time.  I question whether you are ready to contribute constructively to a sophisticated scientific article at this time.  If you insist upon doing so, and go on in the same manner as before, your edits are almost certain to be reverted as unsourced original research or unclearly expressed.  I would advise you instead to postpone editing for now and learn as much as you can about the science, and also to concentrate on improving your command of English.   

Then how you know Jupiter's sunlight is 27 times fainter? That's what you fix by, then would that mean Jupiter is 27 times dimmer? Less sunlight, thne the planet is dimmer. Then reflect sunlight just like our rocky planets, they don't make their own light. Same thing as why nighttime on earth is always black, our ground is always black at night. You said the statement suppose to be source, then how you got those informations from?69.228.145.50  
It simply comes from the inverse square law.  The mean distance of Jupiter from the sun is  approx. 5.2 astronomical units, whose square is 27; a bit more accurate than 25 (based on 5 A.U.)

"Vascular Parkinsonism

Vascular parkinsonism is produced by one or more small strokes that affect the basal ganglia. A stroke is the loss of activity of a discreet brain area (lesion) because of blockage of the blood supply to that brain region. Vascular diseases are associated with a higher prevalence of Parkinson's Disease [1]. There are three different pathologic states that produce Vascular Parkinsonism (VP), including multiple lacunar infarctions in the basal ganglia area [2,3], subcortical arteriosclerotic changes (Binswanger's disease) [2,3] and a single vascular lesion that present a clinical picture indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease [2,3,4]. Parkinson's Disease symptoms occur in Vascular Parkinsonism [5-12]. However, resting tremor is either reduced [5,6], or absent [7,8]. Only a minority, but a large minority, of people with Vascular Parkinsonism respond to L-dopa [9,10].

Re. """"North Sudan"""" is a name that is currently being used."""" (1) Several other terms are also currently being used. Ask any Sudanese editor about that; there is insufficient basis to single out this one colloquial term above the others; (2) Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia, not an online journal - what is in use on a particular day is not determinative because it means so little and prooves nothing; the longer term must be taken into account. So, of course, it is hardly surprising that in the very month that """"South Sudan"""" became independent, Press Reporters, writing for an audience around the world, in many cases an audience that does not even know where Sudan is...used the term """"North Sudan"""". Press reports centred on one particular matter do not tell us whether Sudan is particularly commonly known as North Sudan; (3) there are other reasons apparent from the above discussion including where we explained that Samoa is not Western Samoa, Virginia is not East Virginia, Mongolia is not Outer Mongolia, Luxembourg is not South Luxembourg, Ireland is not Southern Ireland....You are trying to """"put the cart before the horse"""" - trying to assert as a fact that North Sudan is the common name for Sudan before time has had a chance to determine whether or not that is correct - that is CrystalBallGazing etc; and (4) you need a consensus for your change and several editors have disagreed with your change. 84.203.69.183  """,0

   """"The history of philosophy is punctuated
   by revolts against the practices of previous
   philosophers and by attempts to transform 
   philosophy into a science—a discipline in 
   which universally recognized decision-
   procedures are available for testing phil-
   osophical theses.  In Descartes, in Kant, in
   Hegel, in Husserl, in Wittgenstein’s Trac-
   tatus, and again in Wittgenstein’s Phil-
   osophical Investigations, one finds the same
   disgust at the spectacle of philosophers 
   quarreling endlessly over the same issues.  
   The proposed remedy for this situation 
   typically consists in adopting a new 
   method: for example, the method of  “clear
   and distinct ideas” outlined in Descartes’
   Regulae, Kant’s “transcendental method,”
   Husserl’s “bracketing,” the early Wittgen-
   stein’s attempt to exhibit the meaningless-
   ness of traditional philosophical theses by 
   due attention to logical form, and the later
   Wittgenstein’s attempt to exhibit the point-
   lessness of these theses by diagnosing the 
   causes of their having being propounded.  
   In all of these revolts, the aim of the revo-
   lutionary is to replace opinion with knowl-
   edge, and to propose as the proper mean-
   ing of “philosophy” the accomplishment 
   of some finite task by applying a certain set
   of mythological directions.

"If the KLA had a Tactical Victory, they would've completed their strategic goal, if they had a Decisive Victory, they would've killed almost all the Yugoslav Army troops, but the truth is, they have killed around 50 or 30 or 45 Yugoslav Troops. Just like the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the NATO said they destroyed about 400 or 200 Armored Assault vehicles. But the truth is, that they destroyed only 22 or less vehicles. The Yugoslav had Volunteers from Russia, Greece, and I believe Yugoslav volunteers. NATO was involved, but had about six Aircraft (B-2 1, F-16 2, and AC-130 2), I believe the aircraft in the parenthesis are the ones that were used, but didn't inflict casualties, but for the F-16, I believe inflicted casualties 8. So Yugoslavia had less casualties than the KLA because regular troops are stronger than Militias or Guerrillas because they have better handling and training on weapons and hand to hand combat and have armored weapons and tanks and many more. The KLA only had guns.",0

WP:Redlink says (in the 3rd paragraph) that Articles should not have red links to topics that are not likely to have an article, so I think the question we should consider is whether all these students are notable enough to have their own articles in the foreseeable future.

Sehend and Babakkhorramdin currently appear to be engaged in an edit war. Note that the three-revert rule prohibits making more than three reversions in a content dispute within a 24 hour period. Additionally, users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring, even if they do not technically violate the three-revert rule. If you continue, you may be blocked from editing. Please do not repeatedly revert edits, but use the talk page to work towards wording and content that gains a consensus among editors. If necessary, pursue dispute resolution. This has nothing to do with the merits of the dispute, it has to do with cooperative editing.

For instance in Azeri similar to English adjective comes first followed by a noun.

Salam, I'm quite sure the two paragraphs below refer to Salafi defined by the 2nd bullet point ... 
Many others exclude the Muslim Brotherhood [9][10]and Deobandi [11][12] since they believe these groups commit (bid'ah), or worse. 
... and not the first, but I will have to do more research to nail this down.  

Salafis place great emphasis on ritual not only in prayer but in every activity in life - three fingers should always be used when eating, water is to be drunk in three pauses with the right hand while sitting [13], making sure their galabea or whatever garment they wear does not extend below the ankle[14]  so as to follow the example of Muhammad, the Sahaba (the first generation of Muslims), the Tabi‘in (the second generation), and the Taba‘ at-Tabi‘in (the third generation)[citation needed] and make religion part of every activity in life.

Salafism differs from the earlier contemporary Islamic revival movements of the 1970s and 1980s commonly referred to as Islamism, in that (at least many) Salafis reject not only Western ideologies such as Socialism and Capitalism, but also common Western concepts like economics, constitutions, political parties, revolution and social justice. Muslims should not engage in Western activities like politics, """"even by giving them an Islamic slant."""" [15] Instead, Muslims should stick to traditional activities, particularly Dawah. Salafis promote Sharia rather than an Islamic political program or state.  21:35, 7""",0

Seems to me that only something beginning with """"www.bbc.co.uk"""" carries any weight on this site as a 'source', and theyre not about to go and ut out op-eds criticising the boorish Boorman and the whiney Mcgregor. You must know what I'm saying has more than a ring of truth - especially the laughable Davidhoff Cool Water campaign that McGregor cashed in with.

"""little up-tight about what they want in a given article. -  

Also, what do you guys think about putting a quote from the book at the beginning of the article?  I think that might be a pretty good idea. -  
The article has been under some intense copyediting and scrutiny for preparation for a featured article. The plot summary should stay as it was. Quotes at the beginning of the article are not a good idea.   

I don't know if this is what you had in mind, but it's something I noticed a few years back. I first read TKAM in 1960 (I was 9) and since then I've read it at least once a year. It is a rare book that you can read over and over and still find new things. About 5 years ago I read the book and about half way down the first page I realized that in the universe that Harper Lee created in this book, the actual story is very simple and innocent - Scout is just explaining how Jem broke his arm. I have always plumbed the depths of this book, talked about the profundity, it's allusion, the allegory. But this reread I reckon I saw things through Scouts eyes and just listend to what she was saying. To paraphrase - When my brother Jem was 13 he broke his arm badly at the elbow - Then she tells the events that lead up to this happening. Might not be what you want, but I think it's fascinating!   

 Atticus=protagonist? 

The quote in the second paragraph identifies Atticus as the protagonist, but I was always under the impression that Scout was the protagonist, since all the events revolve around her perspective (I even said she was the protagonist in my addition to the Plot Summary section.  Am I wrong, or is the quote mistaken, or what?  What needs to happen in either case? It may not even be that big of a deal, but I'd like to get an answer.  -  
Atticus is not described as the protagonist by the article, but by a legal writer. He has been the subject of more papers in legal journals than any of the other characters in any sort of writing, so it bears pointing out that fame in the lead. I've had to remove information about Atticus per the suggestions of other editors who are assisting me in preparing the article for feature, and Atticus has his own article, that I shifted some information to.

Fantastic article! To avoid posting to the FAC page, can I inquire about this block here?:
""""While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both schools, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, rarely mentioned topics on these campuses at the time.""""
 This sentence refers to """"topics"""", but one topic, racial injustice, is given.
 """"... which was/were rarely..."""" would be clearer, so """"mentioned"""" can't be read as a verb (which I did, when it occurred at the end of a line).

Changed my mind about a second point, that's all at the moment. Thanks, – § 
Thanks for the heads up, Outriggr. And thanks for reading it.   
In the film version Tom is shot while being transported to the prison, it is implied that he was killed and then the story about him running away was made up to hide the blatant murder.  In the book it is much less clear, even on my 5th reading this thought did not enter my mind (that he was murdered and the story was invented to hide the fact).  I think the interpretive twist in the film changes the impact considerably.  It highlights how society is on trial rather than racism.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 67.159.71.32

 Closed and Collapsed Sections 

The following was deleted because it points out that people are trying to introduce legitimate criticism to this article and, rather than engage in a discussion, editors are telling these people to just go away. This is fair because?

What's been going on here is people pointing out that there is legitimate and notable criticism of her knowledge of video games, that Anita does not meet notability standards as no credible sources (nothing even close to a peer reviewed journal) have praised her work, and a bunch of long time editors have said """"No criticism allowed because she awesome! Go away!""""
   
The reason her work will never find its way into a psychology journal is because it is complete BS. There is a huge difference between toys made for boys and toys made for girls because corporations have done extensive market research and design to taste. It has nothing to do with a conspiracy against women that has been successful for thousands of years across every culture known to history. The fact that Anita wants girls to play games made for boys doesn't make her relevant, it makes her a fighter of reality, as well as a hypocrite.
   
She recently expressed her anger at video game makers for including female characters but used a bow on their heads to distinguish them, even though old school graphics left few options, and ignored the fact that modern video games are able to make females distinct in many ways. Yes, bows were used to distinguish females, because women are into accessories. They could have used, I don't know, giant hoop earrings. If Anita is as adamant as she claims, she needs to free her ears of the great patriarchy's brand and shave her head.
   
What about little boys who want to play with dolls and My Little Pony? They get teased much worse than girls who want to play video games made for boys. I guess that's because they're not manly enough, so it's still girls who are being oppressed.
   
The idea that men and women should be treated equally in the workplace is one thing but the idea that men and women don't have fundamentally different tastes, and are the victims of an ancient conspiracy to convince us all that we do, is a bunch of BS that will never be taken seriously by any professional journal. This is why Anita is an irrelevant nobody (and proven liar: """"I love video games."""" I'm not a fan of video games"""") and doesn't deserve a page beyond the incident where she played the victim and was given a bunch of money. I know, """"go away!""""209.89.84.174  """,0

I'm not asking for an apology for your deletions of my honest, good faith, truthful efforts to contribute to Wikipedia at Mormon blogosphere (I'll just chalk this up to you being a little overbearing and unintentionally a bully.)  Please stop referring me to another article without answering my honest question.

"""== Literal text ==
I have changed """"According to the literal text of the constitution, the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen of Australia."""" to refer to Queen Victoria instead. I did this to make a point and that point is that the literal text of the Constitution cannot be taken as an unfailingly reliable guide to either practice or law.

Read the Constitution and you will find no mention of the Prime Minister, who is undeniably the head of government, even if one might imagine that this position is occupied by the Governor-General from a cursory reading of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, but the truth is that this body does not exist.

Please, if you refer to the literal text of the Constitution, either stick to the literal text and refrain from inserting material that does not belong - you will search in vain for the title """"Queen of Australia"""", for example - or qualify it by referring to documents and events such as the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 where the title """"Queen of Australia"""" was introduced.  23:44, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Skyring - It is interesting how your own comments can be used to demonstrate how you add your own point of view - """"I did this to make a point!"""". A point about """"literal"""" text is make by using the adjective """"literal"""". Your point belongs elsewhere.

Anyway, the literal text does not mention """"Queen Victoria"""" it mentions the """"Queen"""". It further states that the """"Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time"""". This is what I has done. Maybe, there is a more accurate way of making this subtitution, but """"Queen Victoria""""! That's wrong, wrong, wrong!

Is it? Have you checked the original? I think that you will find that instead of checking, you jumped in with some more untruths. Please think instead of responding when I press your buttons.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I notice you haven't responded to this. Have you checked the original? This is in Parliament House, and is on public didplay.  00:04, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Yes I have checked: www.foundingdocs.gov.au

""""Not found The page you requested is not available at this address."""" I suggest you check the original. I have.  00:29, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Rather than just jump in and make changes after 15 seconds thought, go back have a think for serveral days before you start adding stuff like this!. It just wastes time. Also, when you say """"Please!"""", """"Read the constitution"""", you are showing contempt for others. 
 01:02, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

When someone makes an obvious mistake like saying the literal text of the Constitution refers to the Queen of Australia, then I am quite justified in asking that person to read it.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

If you refer to the """"literal text"""" of the Constitution you will have to concede that it contains no reference to a """"Queen of Australia,"""" and that is because the thought of Australia as a state separate from the British Empire would have been quite foreign to the men who wrote the Constitution.  01:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I explained the substitution logic above and applied it. Then skyring put in """"Queen Victoria"""" !!! So I reduced it to just just """"Queen"""" (ie no substiution.) I have no problem either way.  11:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Let's stick with the Queen, shall we? That's probably the best bet.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I thought the point about literal text had been made, but I see that it has not been appreciated. The Constitution does not state that the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen. If you want to quote the literal text of the Constition, then by all means do so, but don't go making stuff up that you think might or should or could be in there, when it clearly isn't.  23:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Nowhere in the literal text of the Constitution will you find the statement """"the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen"""". Nowhere. s2 states """"A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative"""". That is a clear statement of intention. I noted s101 previously, which states: """"There shall be an Inter-State Commission"""". There is not an Inter-State Commission, so clearly it is incorrect to say that the literal text of s2 means that the Governor-General is now the Queen's representative, given the example",0

  I actually think it would be disrespectful of Whitlam's memory not to mention that he thought his dismissal was a coup. I know enough about how the word is used in Wikipedia (never for a government the USG suupports) from the Ukrainian articles, which call the February coup in Kiev a """"revolution"""", and a democratic one at that. (I just looked up the word """"coup"""" in the Concise OED, and HiLo48 is right, the OED says """"violent"""". My recollection was that it said """"especially a violent one"""".) It is unfortunate that that article from The Australian doesn't give a direct quote of a full sentence in which Whitlam says that his dismissal was a coup.

"Compromise for introduction
I propose to add the following as introduction.
The Safavids (1501-1722) were a Turkic-speaking Shiite dynasty which ruled Iran from 1502 till 1722 (though several Safavid rulers were nominally reigning until 1736)[3]. The Safavid empire originated in the city of Ardabil in Iranian Azerbaijan and had its origins in the Shiite Safaviyyeh Order. Safavids combined the elements of Turkic tribal militancy with Persian cultural identity and the Shiite teachings of Islam to assert the contemporary Azerbaijani and Iranian Shiite identity. During their reign, Safavids established a vast Iranian empire including the whole of modern Iran and the parts of modern Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, South Caucasus and Turkey.  
After we finally agree on the introduction, let's discuss next the origins part. Thanks.",0

@""""There is no way on earth it was a historical country."""" Yes, well, try telling that to . Frankly, I don't know what his current views are, or whether he's stopped pushing that recently, but I know I've been trying to hammer that point for months over there. For some reason, I honestly cannot fathom why, he's attached to presenting General Nedic's Government of National Salvation as a WWII Serbian state (see this version, for example).

Tomasevich and Ramet, as I recall, are both very clear on the issue:

@""""Do you have any suggestions as to an alternative article title?"""" There's the problem. Notice the wording of the current """"compromise title"""": Serbia under German occupation. What """"Serbia"""" was it that was under occupation? As I said above, there was no """"Serbia"""" since 1918, and the Federal State of Serbia was only de facto established after the liberation of the territory in question (with the establishment of the ASNOS on 12 November 1944 in newly-liberated Belgrade). It does not even geographically correspond with post-war Serbia (as it is significantly smaller).

The whole situation over there is a mess born out of compromise. We essentially have only two organizations in the area: the Military Administration in Serbia, and its subordinate Government of National Salvation. As far as I'm concerned, its perfectly fine whether we decide to cover them as one article (entitled """"Military Administration in Serbia""""), or if the Government of National Salvation gets its own article. What we do not need is this weird article entitled as if it covers an entirely imaginary occupied country. The point is that the official, real name of the territory was """"Military Administration in Serbia"""". A situation perfectly analogous with all the other five Military Administrations.

As I said, the situation is confused by the fact that """"Serbia"""" is apparently the nickname for the """"Military Administration in Serbia"""" (i.e. the territory known under that occupation """"designation""""). Look at Tomasevich. He says """"the Puppet Government of Serbia"""", suggesting (to a person who did not actually read the text) that this """"Serbia"""" was some sort of puppet country. Even though it is perfectly obvious, as you say, that there was no such historical country. Enter PANONIAN, proclaiming that Tomasevich supports him in the claim that there was a country called """"Serbia"""", and that the Government of National Salvation was only the government thereof. And then here comes General Nedic with some coins he issued with the name """"Serbia"""", and presto - a new historical country.   (talk) """,0

All Silesia is situated entirely in Magna Germania territory .

Silesia territory was part of the Holy Roman Empire  by 900 AD (as lien to Moravian, Bohemian dukes). It was conquered by  Boleslaw I Chrobry, a duke of the western Polans, who pledged allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire. The eastern Polans came from the Dnjpr area further west into Germania and are thus named western Polans.

 Minotaurgirl 

Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song """"Behind These Hazel Eyes"""". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called """"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes"""", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like """"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved"""". I like the """"problem solved"""" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.

TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?

I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote """"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?"""" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.

If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.

My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  """,0

Here a forensic anthropologists argues that the race concept is valid and that there is obvious political bias and suppression involved by the race deniers:
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/does-race-exist.html

Here's one scientist that says that: """"The idea that human races are only social constructs has been the consensus for at least 30 years."""" Referring to the Lewontian ignoramuses, of course. But then continues with: """"Beneath the jargon, cautious phrases and academic courtesies, one thing was clear: the consensus about social constructs was unraveling. Some even argued that, looked at the right way, genetic data show that races clearly do exist."""" Referring to the studies by Risch, Tang, Ziv, et al.:
http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/14/opinion/14leroi.html

So cut the crap Maunus and others, there is clearly no worldly scientific consensus, especially with China, and China is a country with over a billion people, not some random """"sh*thole"""" like North Korea that one can simply ignore.

Hi Doc James,

I am employed by the Acoustic Neuroma Association, the organization that publishes the information booklets used as source material for this entry.  I worked with ANA's CEO and Board of Directors to edit and update the existing Vestibular Schwannoma entry.  Our organization felt that the entry had some incorrect information, but also needed more detail.  I updated it using material from ANA's information booklets and the ANA website to bring it to its current state.  Please let me know if you need information from either the CEO or Board to back up any statements.  I have included my personal contact information below if you want to discuss further.

"There is no reason to treat AFF and SF the same. The neutrality policy, which explicitly states that it is not to be confused with “all views deserve equal time no matter how many or how few people hold them”, certainly requires nothing of the sort – look it up yourself, I won’t do your homework for you.

 Moreover, the merits of AFF and the merits of SF are two entirely separate and independent things. No amount of slamming AFF – even if your charges are accurate, which I doubt as your behaviour here strongly suggests your perceptions on such things cannot be trusted – can ever, by itself, make SF worth including. SF must stand or fall on its own merits.

There are many serious strikes against including SF, none of which you have even tried to address. First of all it borders on being a blog, which is already an almost-decisive point against it (there was talk of banning links to blogs entirely at one point though it isn’t actually policy to do so as far as I know – certainly “it’s a blog” has stood uncontested as sufficient reason for deleting links on many pages, including the same one we’re fighting over). Equally importantly, having read parts of SF... though I do not myself agree with the characterization, I can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site. To be blunt, it's largely the chronicle of one person's persecution complex. As I said elsewhere, it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense. And then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in – it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if I could credit the actual content. These three points – heck, any two of them – are sufficient reason leave the link off Wikipedia.

And I haven’t even mentioned the most important reason yet. Your site simply is not notable. As far as I can honestly tell, you are the only person on Earth who considers it an important site. If it was worth linking to, someone other than the site's owner would have done so by now, or at least spoken up in favour of such. That last part, at least, is well-documented Wikipedia policy; look it up yourself as I once again refuse to do your homework for you. 

I am sorry – sort of – if some of this comes across as harsh. Though you will no doubt characterize this note as a personal attack, it is not intended as such (and compared to some of the things you’ve posted about others, including me, it’s not even close to qualifying as one). I wish only to lay out as clearly as possible why there is little hope of SF being linked from that or any other Wikipedia page.",0

Hello James Cantor,

Thank you so much for your comments. The last 21 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine have had wiki pages for a number of years and the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate. I just find is unusual that Crusio's page is so much larger than those who are far more notable. I think Crusio's page size should be about the size of an average Nobel Laureate. I can not but wonder how Wim Crusio's page is so much bigger than that last 21 of the most recent Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine. As a scientist, one tends to plot data on a graph, and if you where to do so, Crusio's data point would be considered an out lier. As I stated, the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate over many years. These pages have been edited by hundreds of users for many years, I think that gives us good yard stick, and says something about how much information a scientists site should have. While I agree with you that more """"good material"""" is better, it appears that hundreds of wiki users disagree with this statement, based upon the data.""",0

"""::You mean there are times on Wikipedia where someone doesn't have grounds to complain about another person's conduct? I've yet to see it. Perhaps if you took the time to review what I've had to deal with, you might understand why I am in the mood I am in. So far, my experience of Wikipedia has been anything but one of collaboration. At various times and by various people, I have been completely ignored, I have been told I am or I do things I provably do not, I have been told provably false things about what Wikipedia's rules supposedly say, and I have had to endure several people telling me all about a subject they clearly know absolutely nothing about, to the point where they are making quite ridiculous claims about how long it would take to write an article to their satisfaction (and obviously, the two of those are linked - people who know nothing about the subject or the media that covers it, aren't likely to have the first clue how long it would take to find and summarise that media, are they?). Apparently though, judging by the fact none of that has attracted any warnings for their conduct, I suppose all of this is completely normal here, and it's just me who is in the wrong for complaining about any of this by referring to people's actual names. So be it I guess. I'm struggling to see how me slowing down is going to change that. It appears to be hard-wired behaviour. I'm afraid that what you may or may not appreciate is that people like Dave are always going to feel insulted when the truth is told - when it's pointed out to them that the facts tell quite a different story about whether or not their claim to be a """"bus enthusiast"""" are remotely true - or when it's pointed out that their claim to have """"literally"""" found no results on Google doesn't stand up to basic scrutiny. Similarly, people like Charles, who are quite clearly only interested in trolling and annoying people, will always act like jerks whenever people follow up their 'reading advice' with questions which expose the fact that their advice appears to be based on nothing contained in the reading material at all. I'm really not sure why any of this needs to actually be raised at an administrator's 'noticeboard' before any notice of it is actually taken. Laziness/disinterest is all I can think of. There certainly seems to be a complete disinterest about the fact articles like NIBS are disappearing from Wikipedia based on absolutely nothing, certainly nothing that subject experts would agree was good reasoning. Still, this is all now being swept under the carpet because of the perfectly normal behaviour on Wikipedia - don't like what the other guy says? Ignore him and he'll go away. If he doesn't go away, complain loudly (and in a completely hypocritical manner in the case of Dave) in the hope someone gets rid of him for you.

"Basic concept of GPS 

Hi!

There are two different issues with the introduction.  The first is style - this is supposed to be a very easy-to-read introduction.  The description as intersecting spheres is covered in much detail later in the article.  Since the article is already very long, perhaps another description is not needed in the introduction.

The second issue is the number of satellites needed.  This is 3 with an accurate clock (a ns or so will suffice).  This gives the distance to 3 satellites, which is enough to determine position.  (These will be 2 solutions, but only one can be close to the surface of the Earth, so this is not a practical problem.)  With 4 satellites you need only a crude clock, provided your hardware measures the 4 satellites at (almost) the same time.  This allows you to solve for x,y,z, and t.  See any GPS textbook for the details of how this is done.",0

"Not sure if the story about the Pope telling a guy to be proud to be a Jew is verifiable enough to be on Wikipedia 

1. Effectively, the only source is one ANONYMOUS article by a person who claims to have been directly involved.  Technically, there are two articles, but the one from 2006 relies only on the one from 1944 as its sole source, and does not indicate that the author of the 2006 did any independent research beyond finding the 1944 article on the Internet.  Generally, Wikipedia does not consider a single unverified first-person account to be sufficient, and that should be especially true when it is anonymous.

2. According to the 1944 article, there should be many, many witnesses.  After 69 years, neither the Pope, nor any of the Vatican officials there with him, nor any of the 80 or so visitors waiting has confirmed that this incident ever happened.  Some of the witnesses, especially the German soldiers, might have died before the story was first published.  However, if it was true, there should have been at least some surviving witnesses.  The lack of any independent verification makes the entire story rather doubtful.

Utter nonsense showing exactly what is wrong with Wikipedia

This article reads like a press release, and uncritically accepts the claim that the CL is a """"civil rights"""" organization whose primary purpose is fighting """"bigotry"""", when in fact they attack anyone who criticizes any aspect of Catholicism no matter how politely or correctly, they actively proselytize for Catholicism as the one true religion, and their leader William Donohue, who is for all practical purposes their only member, has made numerous anti-Jewish statements. It is also a lie to say that the CL is a lay organization not controlled by the Church, when in fact their office is located within the Archdiocese of New York's headquarters and they work closely with the Archbishop to coordinate media strategies.

The NPOV and anti-libel policy on Wikipedia has become an """"accept anything everyone says without blinking an eye and don't criticize anyone on relevant grounds"""" policy because none of the editors here actually know anything about the subjects of the articles. If someone who was not a fifteen-year-old anime-watching idiot could actually become an administrator around here, maybe we could see an article on the Catholic League actually discuss what the Catholic League is known for in American politics. Instead, we get nonsense criticism sections telling us things like what PETA thinks of Beyonce Knowles, while anything of actual relevance to the world today is declawed for fear of """"offending"""" people who don't like the truth or for being sued for libel due to a poor understanding of the law.

 The focusing on dinosaurs as being the main or only  subject of religious interest doesn't really stand up since it is sufficient to show that a conflict exists between bible literalists/ young earthers and science in general if any life form can be shown to have died out before Adam and Eve. This relates to the doctrine of original and the fall of man. It would appear that some people believe that if any dinosaurs can be shown to have coexisted with man then the problem of bible chronology and science is solved., but thats no the case. There is also the issue of dating fossils in general and how it compares with the age of the earth claimed by YEC.

So there is no such thing as sainis claiming to be Rajputs. Sainis are Yaduvanshis and there is no such thing that sainis claim to be Yaduvanshi, it is a fact that sainis are Yaduvanshis. Sainis were warriors. Also in sikhism, sainis played a very important role in the areas of Anandpur sahib and Chamkaur sahib, fought for Guru Gobind Singh ji.

 basic income dispute resolution 

I don't understand the finding """"futile"""", or how to proceed to resolve the issue.  

Regarding the [Wikipedia,_bicycles,_and_wagons] reference, its my understanding that I am building a bicycle, that may be slightly off spec, and the editors are ordering the steel melted and shipped to hell, instead of allowing the bicycle to be refined into spec.  I point out also that the [basic income] is listed as a priority by four wikigroups, and so it is a pretty important bicycle.  Also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage, and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct, and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability, IMO, but regardless of this opinion, a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed.  To keep the bicycles/wagons analogy, the page was a high quality bicycle, and an important bicycle to 4 wikigroups.  There is a difference of opinion over whether the bicycle meets specs, but it is a functional bicycle that is more useful than a pile of melted metal shipped far away.   """,0

Bray suspects that it may have been the money Bacon gave them that brought the matter to notice: certainly, homosexual relations between masters and servants were clearly common enough to provoke the satirists. As for the weight allotted to it in the article: this is a classic situation in Wikipedia. Any implication of homosexuality in an historical figure has to be detailed and fully referenced beyond normal expectation, otherwise it is then accused of being an unsupported allegation, with the resulting endless edit war. In addition, the earlier point made on this thread about including it: """"Because a significant amount of modern scholarship is focused on how it affected the development of his ontology"""" is extremely valid. The growth of gay studies departments within universities in recent years, and the flood of research and interpretation, is having a significant impact, and is literally re-writing history. To give a tiny example: the discoveries and interpretations in Crompton's 'Byron and Greek Love' have affected every Byron biography published after 1985. Multiply this a thousand times, and one gets an idea of the tsunami of change. For the homophobic this presents a confronting situation, but it's the reality.

This article is primarily about the World Cricket League and, although the regional competitions are connected to this in the sense that they act as qualification, I think the section could be considerably reduced - particularly now the regional competitions have less impact on new teams entering the league.

By doing this you remove a great swathe of information that clogs up this article and that can be found elsewhere.

 Bibliography Revamp with Serialisation 

I'm proposing a revamp of the Bibliography section including the addition of a second table dealing with the serialisations of the Hornblower novels.
The serialisations were actually the first publication of all the works except the first novel so I think they deserve the space.

Currently I've put my proposed new content up at User:Jaa101/sandbox.

With the main bibliography table the main change I'm proposing is to have separate columns for the US and UK titles which are so often different.
This frees up the comments column for other information.
I've also made both the dates of publication and dates of the stories more precise.

One worry I have with both my tables is that I've linked extensively and repeatedly in them.
Normally one would link only on the first occurrence but, in this case, the tables are sortable so what's first may change.
I think it's acceptable as it is.

Finally, I've added mention of the first and most important omnibus """"Captain Hornblower"""" and also the """"Cadet Editions"""".

I propose to change the main page based on feedback.

Speedy deletion of MyAviation.net
 A tag has been placed on MyAviation.net, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read our the guidelines on spam as well as the Wikipedia:Business' FAQ for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

"Your statement that she has “refused to talk about the matter all together” is patently false. In response to a T.V. show host’s question “How are you responding to the rumors about you and Eddie Cibrian,” Leann replied “You know what, everything is so not black and white.” And on another show (Regis and Kelly), the same response: “Everything people read is not… it’s not as easy as black and white.” Also noteworthy is her statement on her blog that “This is a difficult time for me and my loved ones” –again with a complete absence of any denial of the affair. No one has seriously argued that it was not her or Eddie in the video, and I submit that any attempt to do so would simply call into question either the arguer’s intelligence (cf. Moon landing hoax), or else his or her neutrality. But really none of this matters, because – as I said – I completely agree with you that this is currently not Wikipedia material. This is not to say, of course, that it won’t become Wikipedia material. I’m not going to lecture you on what might cause this to become Wikipedia material, because – assuming that you’re as experienced an editor as you say you are – you will already know. Suffice it to say, however, that there are myriad entries of affairs on Wikipedia profiles, and even a cursory look at any of them sheds light on some common features of all. I am sorry if I offended you by calling into question your neutrality. As Wikipedians, we should all strive toward verifiability and away from bias. In keeping with these tenants, I can guarantee you that if this affair rises to the level of verifiability and importance, both in terms of mainstream media attention and cultural impact, that warrants inclusion, I will not be alone in fulfilling my duty as a responsible Wikipedian to support inclusion of said affair.

"Hi 

Hey brownaddictUK, welcome to wikipedia. I've noticed that you put the www.helpingaddicts.net link on a couple of pages that I watch over, and wanted to give you a quick heads up on editing wikipedia.  as you've probably noticed, a lot of the links were pretty quickly removed by editors because this isn't the place for them.  I'm all for harm minimisation & abstaining from addictions, but this is a place to provide factual information on subjects.  To put a link to an external link to a website, it has to have some further specific information about a subject, or for the purpose of verfiying information in the article.  The website you added doesn't fit either of these categories.

But i would like to invite you to contribute factual information to wikipedia, judging by the list of articles you added the link to, you seem to have a fairly good knowledge of drug related issues, maybe you could share that by contributing to articles.

 If you need help on how to name new articles, look at Naming Conventions, and for help on formatting the pages visit the Manual of Style. If you need general help, look at Help and the FAQ, and if you can't find your answer there, check the Village pump (for Wikipedia related questions) or the Reference Desk (for general questions).

A man of muslim belief, egyptian nationality married a women of christian belief, german nationality.
In aggreement of the couple, the mentioned muslim converted to the christian religion and joined the christian creed.

1 - What is the islamic judgement about the person's status according to the islamic punishment?

2 - Are his childen understood as muslims or christians? What is the judgement?

The Answer:

God, Lord of the worlds is praised. God bless the man of the envoys, our Lord Muhammed, his family and all his fellows and give them  salvation.

Herewith we grant information: since he is dropped from the islam, he will be invited for regretfulness. Does he not regret, he will be killed pertaining to rights and obligations of the islamic law.

Referring to his children, so they are minor muslims. When they reach full age, and if they remain within the islam, they are muslims. If they leave the islam, they will be invited to regret. If they do not regret, they will be killed. God the almighty knows best.

 747 Table 

Hi how are you?
On the table I created at Boeing 747, I intentionaly left the first 2 years before deliveries at zero to give a clear picture of when the fisrt plane was delivered to a customer. Had I started with 1969, it might make it seem like some deliveries might have been missed. But I started with 1967 and 1968 at zero to show a marked begining of 747s in service. If you dont mind I like to put it back to Zero.  
 I'm good.  Sure, change that back.  That makes sense.  It looked like maybe the deliveries started 2 years behind schedule. - 
 Went ahead and changed the 1967 number back to 0. - 

 777-300ER 

thanks! 

People always make this range mistake. Another guy asked me why a 777F has more fuel than 777-200ER yet has 5,000 km less range? It took a while for him to get it.
 Sure.  If you can improve the wording there more, please do so. - 

 787 

How is it going?
On Boeing 787 there are 8 different aircrafts in the specs. I believe we should remove all of them. Have a nice 3 table specification chart on the 787-3 787-8 787-9 and thats it. We can even bring the 3-way cross section of the 787 right next to this spec chart. I believe articles need to be stand alone and comparing it to everything diminishes this. Why not add Ilyushin il-96 here too then? Or many other aircaft. The 787 article is very very poorly done. Its not an encyclopedic entry. Its simply a collection of newsbits. It has become a forum to bash the A350 or even the A380. As soon as a story comes out, somebody writes a paragraph there. I have been doing some updates and I want to know if you agree about making the article more about the 787 and less about other planes.  
 Hey, going OK here.  I can see both sides on the comparison chart.  2 planes (one smaller and one larger) for comparson is enough.  It'd be OK to remove non-787 planes since other airliner articles don't have them.  The fact this is a new plane helps causes lower quality in the article, I think.  People spend more time just adding info than cleaning it up and all.  I'll keep an eye on it and do what I can.  Take it easy Bangabalunga.  - 

 747-8 Speed 

You are correct!
It was .85 and .845 on Boeing last week. I dont know when they changed it.
I know that wind tunnel testing has not gone well and the 747-8 will have more drag than 747-400 but I guess in order
to have bragging rights against the A380, they must be faster.
I am sure airlines will still cruise at 0.845 though in the Intercontinental just to be efficient.
Take care  
 No problem.  The 747 has had a cruise speed of Mach 0.85 for some time.  Don't think there's not that much a difference there.  Good catch on the upper deck 3/10 windows thing.  I was confused before.  - 

Hughes Helicopters
Some user slapped a {notability} tag on the Hughes Helicopters article. I removed it (to get his attention, as some people don't read the talk pages), and posted comments on the talk page also. I don't know what his problem with the page is, but it might be that it's unsourced. He just put the unreferenced tag up today, so it's not like noone won't know that's a problem. Can you take a look, and see what you think? Thanks. -  
 Sure.  Will do.  - 

Inlet geometry
On F/A-18 Hornet, you added the F-16 as having variable inlet geometry. I always understood that it was fixed on the F-16, and I can have several printed sources on that. Has that been changed on later F-16s? -  
 I only reverted a change where the F-4 replaced the F-16 in this sentence: The engine air intake of the Hornet is notable among its contemporaries for being """"fixed"""", unlike the F-14, F-15, and F-16 which have variable geometry or variable ramp engine air intakes..  The F-4 is from an earlier era.  Please correct that if needed.  Thanks. -

 Re:ANI question 

Hey Bugs, just as a follow up to this question, there are no Malware in the program. As I answered about the registry cleaner, some people don't understand how much damage """"cleaning"""" your registry can do. Not that I've never done it, but I tend to manually remove items these days because I don't trust any """"cleaners"""". In any case, it's the 3rd party software that most complaints are coming from. And although those are not Malware either, some of the programs do trigger Avast and some other anti-virus software, but as Adware or potentially unwanted programs. These are installed if you aren't reading the installation and just click """"Next, Next, Next\ etc.. You have the """"Decline"""" option, but they don't make it very clear. It's disappointing that CNet now allows this, but it's all about $$$. And they can just say there are options to decline. Which there are. You can delete this whenever, I just didn't want to clutter ANI up with the expansion of this gibberish. heh   

 Main Page appearance: Babe Ruth 

This is a note to let the main editors of Babe Ruth know that the article will be appearing as today's featured article on July 11, 2014. If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the Main Page. If you prefer that the article appear as TFA on a different date, or not at present, please ask . You can view the TFA blurb at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/July 11, 2014. If it needs tweaking, or if it needs rewording to match improvements to the article between now and its main page appearance, please edit it, following the instructions at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/instructions. The blurb as it stands now is below:

Babe Ruth (1895–1948) was an American baseball outfielder and pitcher who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1914 to 1935. Born in Baltimore, Ruth was sent at age seven to St. Mary's, a reformatory where he learned baseball skills. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles. He began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including 714 career home runs. In his fifteen years with the Yankees, Ruth helped them win seven American League pennants and four World Series championships. His big swing led to escalating home run totals that boosted baseball's popularity and made home runs a major factor in the sport. Ruth's unprecedented power and carousing lifestyle made him a larger-than-life figure in the """"Roaring Twenties"""". One of the first five inductees into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture, and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. 

You (and your talk-page stalkers) may also be interested to hear that there have been some changes at the TFA requests page recently.  Nominators no longer need to calculate how many """"points"""" an article has, the instructions have been simplified, and there's a new nomination system using templates based on those used for DYK suggestions. Please consider nominating another article, or commenting on an existing nomination, and leaving some feedback on your experience. Thank you.

"""
Fanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view. 

 Background 
Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements. 

As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as """"fanboys."""" Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.

The term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of """"teenybopper"""".

History of fanboys and the term
The term """"fanboy"""" is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software.
 
Popular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion.  In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys.

The earliest published uses of the word """"fanboy"""" have been dated to 1982.  One reference is to the cover of the """"Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide"""".  On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state """"Fanboys of America,"""" who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics.

Also published in 1982, a comic strip appeared in Jim Engel and Chuck Fiala's """"Fandom Confidential"""" comic.  In the strip, Jim and Chuck met comic artist/writer John Byrne and collapsed into """"mindless paroxysms of adoration.""""  The John Byrne character responded that they were """"a couple of fanboys in bondage"""" (a play on words referring to a Monty Python sketch in which an Elizabethan era character reads what she claims to be a new Shakespeare work called """"Gay Boys in Bondage"""". http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1;=Miscellaneous+Questions#154 Another early use is in a smart-alec editorial reply by """"Ambush Bug"""" to a letter in his comic in 1985.

CONTROVERSIAL?  What was is controversial regarding my listing?  There are facts Randy Campo was born in 1952 and was killed in 1992.

There is a Randy Campo Lectureship at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, the most recent taking place Thursday 17 June 2010.  The Randy V.

"Wikimedia Stories Project 

Hello,

My name is Victor Grigas, and I'm a storyteller at the Wikimedia foundation. We're telling stories of Wikipedia users, editors, donors, programmers and staff to paint a picture of who uses Wikipedia - for the 2011 fundraiser.

I am in the process of planning a trip to India to gather stories from Indian Wikipedians in face-to-face interviews (possibly on video). 

My primary goal is to conduct 15-20 interviews, and hopefully enough of my interviews will make compelling stories that will effectively solicit donations from the public. These stories may also be used for other communication purposes by the foundation.

I found your userpage on a list of prolific Wikipedians and thought I’d reach out to you. Prolific editing is always a good story to tell!

I believe it will be useful for those people who try to find out more about these companies. So, here is the question. Do you think it will be appropriate to add such links? Thanks for the insight.

Rationale

My dear fellow - what is yours? 92.4.216.135  

I'll be completely honest with you.  Some of the stuff I see is pretty funny, and sometimes I chuckle.  However, I use Wikipedia quite often to research random subjects.  With that being said, I don't like to see stupid crap plastering an article.  If you want to vandalize something besides an article (i.e. user pages, talk pages, etc.), I really don't care as long as its not mine.  Other people might care but not me.  Just leave the articles alone, unless of course you're adding useful information.   Ndenison talk 

 Hair trigger revert? 

You reverted my changes to Game Artificial Intelligence in the cheating AI section. These changes focused the section on the importance of cheating to AI itself; the section as it stood got too distracted by the wider considerations of cheating, and by specific examples.

I understand that, as an anon, I get less consideration. But please actually compare before/after in context. Trimming can be constructive too.

Many other wikis have """"featured articles"""", and translating them is quite straightforward (yes, time consuming). One issue is sourcing - we can't trust unreferenced information. Prose might get nicely polished, but the facts could be POVish or plain wrong. Unfortunately, many other wikis don't demand referencing, and I had to research that independently. Cheers.   """,0

 Sound of jewellery 

The sound of jewellery has played an enermous part in many stories, poems, and religious literature (more details and sources to come).
Different jewellery creates different sounds, ie plastic bangles create a high pitched clink sound, while others such as baxelite produce
a """"clunck"""" sound. Knowing how a particular piece of jewellery sounds can help someone identify whether or not a piece of jewellery is fake.
Indeed people have written about the sound of """"fake gold"""", and jewel makers such as Sharon Alouf, a famous jeweler have praised the high frequency pitched noise of gold bangles(most likely real gold she is wearing). To this day, the jeweler claims, """"the sound of bangles clinking together is very soothing to me. It always reminds me of motherhood.""""Alouf is even partial to particular tones. """"Gold produces my favorite sound,"""" she says, """"the pitch is higher and clearer, which I find energizing."""" """,0

"Perhaps. AFAIK his resignation is at least as big an event as the Titstare controversy itself, probably bigger. We probably can't or shouldn't create an article about him, or it, for WP:BLP1E reasons. Also, reviewing this, it seems that his Titstare comments were a trigger for his firing but not the real reason or cause, they just set some things in motion that led to people reviewing his Twitter feed. In that sense, I do think it is of due weight with respect to this controversy because it is perhaps part of the aftermath. As it stands, I think that reporting his Titstare comments and people's reaction to them, without mentioning that he was subsequently fired over a history of Twitter comments that were perceived as sexist, etc. (but that he defended as satirical) would be missing the bigger picture. Although I think we have enough sourcing to include his firing and the surrounding controversy, I think that if we decide that it's too irrelevant or too much of a BLP problem to include here, we should take most or all mention of him out rather than giving readers only part of the story. -",0

 DMSG again 

The reference to the DMSG, Deutsche Multiple Sklrose Gesselschaft, is problematic. It's a primary source. Is it independent? From what? Organizations form as patient organizations, often, but as they develop, they find sources of funding, often from drug companies, and can end up advocating the interests of drug companies instead of their original constituency. This is not any kind of charge against DMSG directly (maybe someone who can search German sources can tell us more), but such a source does not necessarily stack up well against standard secondary sources, and the Medline article is pretty good and balanced. The headline there is telling: """"Endovascular Treatment of Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency Safe, May Provide Benefit in MS."""" Obviously, Dr. Jung was correct, such a claim is overstated, if taken as proven, the study was inadequate for that.

There are two parts to this article: the alleged syndrome and a proposed treatment which proceeds from the hypothesis regarding the syndrome. They are separate, and, to some extent, the article confuses them.

I can say this about DMSG and CCVI: if I had MS, or someone I loved had MS, I'd be very excited about CVVI and the implications. That is far from saying that I'd jump for invasive surgery, and caution is exactly appropriate. But having MS is no fun, either, and one would think that information about CCVI and the research going on with respect to it would be prominent on the DMSG home page. The link from the article does not go to a specific page about CCVI, it seems that it might be pointing to a video, but I can't see a translation of that. I was unable to find a page on the DMSG site that justifies the claim in the article. Accordingly, I'll be removing it.

However, I did find on the site a forum post that led me to this: [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180802.php Stanford University Halts CCSVI Treatments After Two Serious Incidents]. Cause for concern, of course. There is [http: //www.examiner.com/x-32750-Lima-Multiple-Sclerosis-Examiner~y2010m1d6-CCSVI-Stanford-University-and-the-University-of-Buffalo CCSVI, Stanford University, University of Buffalo and University of British Columbia], as well, about that Stanford report and more.

It's very important to distinguish between the syndrome hypothesis and any attempted treatment. The problem at Stanford has to do with treatment only.

There is a very clear report from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, dated Feb. 9, 2010. This is also a primary source, but should give a more complete view of a patient advocacy group on CCVI.""",0

 Wikipedia IS evil 

It is host to the same big political groupthink game that goes on in
all of the rest of civilization. It is a battleground for propaganda warfare, a lawless game in which anything can be said as long as its in """"neutral"""" language even if its a propagandists lie, and even if it exists only to dispute a known fact. It is a place notable mostly for what it conspicuously lacks. There are in general thousands of articles which tell us about as much as a High Schooler might, and which then devolve into factoids and rhetoric. The expertise of depth
knowledge is missing. No expert would submit themselves to a situation of patent pack psychology informational riot. Wikipedia is
Evil. And You, Jimbo Wales, are the guy who created it. Maybe you should try some Formal Logic in the mix. Maybe this """"Randian"""" Environment could use some controls on its chaos vectors. Maybe even
a realistic and functional methodology for dealing with abuse might be in order. 

Nice graphic box at the top of the page says to go post at the admin
desk,. Funny, i tried that, and got less than no result. Abusiveness is rampant and the organization is headless. I can tell Wikipedia in
fifty places what its problems are and how to solve them, but wikipedias nose is in the air, and the God king doesn't seem to read
his talk page. What you have here isn't an encyclopedia, and in pretending, all that it offers a legitamate participant over the long term is abuse. The admin desk won't help you if you are being attacked and baited with ad hominems; they don't even know what one is. They aren't required to pick up any education to become admins;
they come with the standard prole """"opinion"""" fully intact, and no knowledge to back anything up. 

Good luck with your evil science social sciences project.

"I have just read the source. I think you are very right. It is about global health but again not about Medical Tourism which is a subcategory of globalized healthcare driven by the patient movement. For example the reference article starts with the example of Dave who had traveled to Tanzania as a part of global health rotation. In this case, Tanzania is neither the medical destination nor the developed country with collapsed or collapsing social health care system therefore no interest to medical tourism studies. It is clearly not relevant to the medical tourism. I think if medical tourism would be defined with economics terms such as imports and exports (by the way I do not like it in this way, just to clarify), we might not be so confused.

It is a family of cuckoo, but smaller. And it really sings. A popular bird next to uguisu who tells you the spring has come, while hototogisu being the one for the summer. Here is an illustration. I was not suggesting to change the word, but just asking whether there was a better word to be used here. If not, it can stay as it is.Spventi: """"your concern about the word """"coax"""" is entirely misplaced."""" and Jim_Lockhart: """"I think coax is fine for saying that"""" - Hmmm. I withdraw. I trust you two than my dictionaries. One comment to Jim_Lockhart. Yes, he used flattery when necessary, especially in his early times, and I don't think it gives a negative feeling by describing him that way. That was not my worry. What I wanted to say was that it is only one face of him. You wrote """"resourseful as he was"""", agreed.Now that I accepted the word coax and the form without first person, I admit Spventi's saying """"the changes you made to the English versions of the senryu were clearly not improvements."""" Sorry again. One last question:  don't you feel like making some mutial reference between this section and Toyotomi_Hideyoshi#Cultural_point_of_interest? """,0
"Afghanistan 

Is it just me that thinks it somewhat dubious that he would actually have been positioned 'on the front lines' in Afghanistan. Given the Taliban's use of mortars I'd say that it's very unlikely that he was actually stationed so close to the conflict as is made out by the press, if anything it seems like a token gesture, to show that the royal family will fight alongside the British Armed Forces.

Generally, I don't acknowledge the comments of someone who goes out of his/her way to talk down to me.  Suffice it to say that the burden of proof is on you and the Democrats to prove that the Grand Kleagle is NOT a racist pig of a Senator.  He was the one who choose to join the Klan, it was he that choose to recruit new members to the cross-burning organization.  It was NOT me that made him do those things.  It was him that wrote several articles defending the Klan after he supposedly left it.  It was him that as recently as 2001 was throwing around the n-word.  He is the racist, not me.  You have chosen to use your time and effort to defend the racist.  You need to look inside you for your personal motivation on why you feel that you must defend the racist.  The section of the article defending the Kleagle is indefensible.  Look at Trent Lott's bio.  There is no Republican writing an apology for Lott's comments.  Why do you feel the need to defend the Kleagle?  Oh, by the way, I can't believe that I even responded to you.  I only responded because you are fellow Jayhawk, but I normally would not respond to comments of your tone.  I will continue to remove and edit any untrue information that you place in an article also.  Only 13 Senators voted against Rice.  That is 13% of the Senators.  That is not a large segment of the societyno matter how hard you try to make people believe that it is.  The one African-American Senator did not vote against her.  Only the most partisan Democrats voted against her.- 01:19, 31",0

"By going through the websites I was capable of establishing a final evaluation for all the websites. I noticed that all four of the websites have a dark background (dark gray) and a light font on the writing (white). This makes it easier and clearer for people to read. Also, enlargement of the font would have made it more improved. In my opinion, leaving the whole text in all the websites in a normal font and not an italic font would be much more readable particularly to old people, and people who have sight problems. In addition, while looking into the data in the websites, you can clearly notice the politeness of the text which makes the websites suitable for people from all age groups. From searching the websites, I have observed the fact that there are completely no advertisements or commercials which help the reader to realize that the websites are reliable. Hence, some of the data entered in the websites are taken from unfair sources. For example, Graham Browely is the ex manager of the band, thus, he is expected not to be supporting the band and imply negative points concerning their new album. Also, Mike Jones is the current manager of the band; it is predictable of him to pronounce all the positive points about the band for the sake of advertising their new album. All websites are provided with quotations that are told by important people. It is essential for people who are interested in the subjects of the websites to also be interested in what important people have to say about the issue. This helps provide people with what they are looking for. I could not help but notice the link added on the end of the page in Mike Jones’ website which works perfectly well. This link is helpful for all people who are fans of Mike Jones and it leads them directly to his personal profile. Graham and Mike Jones’ websites show the date. It is apparent that Mike Jones’ website is more up to date than Graham’s. It is essential for a website to be up to date to stay interesting for the people viewing it. In my opinion, the most suitable website is the Joan Hoarse magazine website. The only thing that is missing is the date. The date gives the readers the feeling of loyalty that they are reading something that is new and interesting.

"""POSTED FROM MARYLAND TALK PAGE WITH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM Thisisbossi

I'm getting the sense of a double standard for Maryland here. Why is Maryland the focus of this brigade when other state intros are equivalent? I’ve avoided posting in these discussions because it seems you guys are reluctant to seeing the truth and now I have to write a book to get my point across. Even still you will believe what you want to because of personal preference or you don’t “feel it belongs”. Most of all I’m sure you could care less about the state itself otherwise you wouldn’t object. But you want an answer so here it is...

If you think the intro to the Maryland page needs a rework then you have your work cut out for you because you’re going to have to change just about every other state. Case in point, this is the last paragraph from the Commonwealth of Virginia intro, 

 """"Virginia is known as the """"Mother of Presidents"""", because it is the birthplace of eight U.S. presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Woodrow Wilson), more than any other state. Most of the United States' early presidents were from the state. Virginia has also been known as the """"Mother of States"""", because portions of the original Colony subsequently became Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and West Virginia as well as some portions of Ohio.""""

How is that anymore relevant than proclaiming """"Maryland donated the land for Washington, D.C.""""? Doesn't talk about presidents from decades past and ceding portions of land belong in the History section according to you?

Not convinced? Here’s part of the intro from the State of Wisconsin, this should put your economic fears to rest,

Wisconsin's rural economy was originally based farming (especially dairy), mining, and lumbering. In the 20th century tourism became important, and many people living on former farms commuted to jobs elsewhere. Large-scale industrialization began in the late 19th century in the southeast of the state, with the city of Milwaukee as its major center. In recent decades, service industries, especially medicine and education, have become dominant. Wisconsin's landscape, largely shaped by the Wisconsin glaciation of the last Ice Age, makes the state popular for both tourism and many forms of outdoor recreation.

In previous version they were proclaiming fur trade!!! But it's a sin to proclaim the life sciences which has become the foremost important industry in Maryland right now?

Didn’t get the message? Try the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

During the 19th century, Massachusetts transformed itself from a mainly agricultural economy to a manufacturing one, making use of its many rivers for power to operate factories for shoes, furniture, and clothing. Its economy declined in the early twentieth century when industry moved south in search of cheaper labor. A revitalization came in the 1970s when, nourished by the graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education, the Boston suburbs (particularly those around Route 128) became home to dozens of high-technology companies. Massachusetts' colleges and universities, as well as its technology sectors, continue to thrive.

The state is also considered a haven for progressive, liberal thought and often sends political candidates to the national scene, however, the four most recent presidential aspirants, Ted Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, and John Kerry, were all unsuccessful. . Massachusetts was the home state of US Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Calvin Coolidge, and John F. Kennedy, and the birth state of George H. W. Bush.
As of 2006, Massachusetts is the only state in the union to legalize marriage of gay and lesbian couples.

Hi Pterantula,

The encyclopedia entry requires attributions and references.  For example, the studies of the """"effects of Landmark Education"""" is from the third-party surveys.  If, instead, the encyclopedia entry were to have customer testimonials instead, they could be struck on grounds they are not verifiable.  (We've gone around in circles on that many times as well.)

As well, the 20 points of critique are all against Landmark Education (with rebuttals in many cases).

As for litigation, I am aware of five outbound cases:

Pre-emptive warning

1) Traci Hukill """"The Est of Friends"""" (1998, pre-emptive warning, no suit filed)

Actual litigation, outbound

 Elle Magazine   (1998, LE achieved no result)
 Cynthia Kisser  (1997, LE won retraction)
 Margaret Singer (1997, LE won retraction)
 Rick Ross       (2005, LE cancelled suit for product disparagement)

There are about three inbound cases (against LE):
 Stefanie Ney (court ruled in LE's favor)
 Been versus Weed (2002; 10 claims, 3 settled, 7 dropped;  LE was a cross-defendent)
 Tracy Neff (1997, sexual harrassment, settled out of court;  LE lacked a """"sexual harrassment"""" policy at the time and got pulled in on this)

Does anyone have anything more than this from LE's inception in 1991 (14 years ago)?  Litigation regarding """"est"""" should be on the """"est"""" page.   For a company with $70 million in revenue and over 800,000 customers of the Landmark Forum, this is a tiny amount of litigation.

 Purpose of the usage section 

I've reverted edits that came with the explanation """"The purpose of this section is not to provide usage advice or to use intuitive but inaccurate descriptions like '""""doer of the action.'""""  Actually, the original text was well-supported by citations to usage manuals, and the particular words """"doer of the action"""" are directly from The Merriam-Webster Dictionary of English Usage, which linguists consider the best usage guide.  The edited language did not cite any support for its assertions.

More broadly, even if the replacement language did have good support, I don't think it would be as good for this section.  I recognize that Wikipedia is not a how-to guide, but in a section on English usage, I think the text should explain its meaning in a way that will be understood by someone to whom it is a new subject.  Statements such as """"the passive voice is used to place focus on the grammatical patient, rather than the agent,"""" can be understood only by someone who is already knowledgeable about the subject.  That statement is also less specific than the text it replaced.    """,0

Hi! It was me who wrote that caption, however I did not say originally. """"My"""" sentence is: """"The IQs of a large enough population are calculated so that they conform to a normal distribution."""" I totally agree with you that this is not how it was done originally, but as far as I know, this is how it is done today. Unfortunately, I don't have a specific source for it, but it is basically what I have understood from reading lots of intelligence-test-manuals, books on assessment and intelligence, etc. 
There is no research that says that """"amount of intelligence"""" is distributed across the population in the same way as a normal distribution, but this is the way IQ-tests are made.
For example, if a small country suddenly gets a high influx of highly intelligent immigrants, suddenly more than 50% of the population would have an IQ of 100 or higher. But instead of changing the normal distribution, the next time when they standardize the IQ-test, they take a representative sample of 1000 or 10,000 inhabitants, and the ones that have an average intelligence get IQ 100, the 2% most intelligent people get IQ 130 or more; the 2% least intelligent people get IQ 70 or less.
This is how I have understood the statistics behind IQ. However, I am not a statistics specialist at all, so please correct me if I am wrong!  talk """,0

 Whole Ariticle Needs to br Rewritten 

i believe this whole article needs to be rewritten fromntop to bottom.  In jumps around in a chronological sense, thereby notbshowingbin a cohesive way how improvisational theatre has developed.  There is a lot of text devoted to thevwork of Keith Jonstone, but his work is no more important than dozens of other writers; moreover, his importance is no where near as significant in the US as is the work of Spolin, Shepherd, Sills, and Close (and the rolenof IO and The Second City.

The article, in it's present form, looks like a hodge-podge of sentences and paragraphs from many authors with no attention paid to consistency.

A rewrite would also avoid some duplication.

How does one initiate such a process?  Who selects the person to take the first stab at it?  I would propose that Michael Golding of Los Angeles do the rewrite.  He has a masters degree in improvisation from NYU, personally knows many of the people who have created modern improvisational theatre (Shepherd, Sills, Close, Halpern to name a few), and is a professional writer (his latest credit is for writing the film """"David Shepherd: A Lifetime of Improvisational Theatre"""").

Quigley's book can be viewed on both Google Books and Amazon, where this exact statement appears with a reference to page 216 in Donald Neff's """"Warriors For Jerusalem"""" (1984). I troubled myself to the library and found the relevant paragraphs. In an episode titled """"June 5: Israel Attacks"""", Neff says the following about president Johnson (top of page 216):
""""He also received a message from his friend Arthur Krim. A memorandum to the President that day read: """"Arthur Krim reports that many arms shipments are packed and ready to go to Israel, but are being held up. He thinks it would be most helpful if these could be released.""""
Under the message the President had scribbled: """"1,000 rounds of 105mm artillery shells cleared. 2,000 fuses - availability, Gas masks. New Requests: A-4 jet fighter-bombers Hawk antiaircraft missiles.""""
Before the day was out, Krim was informed that gas masks had already been dispatched to Israel and he left a message for Johnson expressing his appreciation.""""
That's it. The rest of the page deals with various people he met and communicated with, and has nothing to do with arms shipments of any kind. In short, Quigley's assertion that """"on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""" is unsupported by the evidence he provides. The only thing documented as sent are gas masks. There's no indication if and when any ammunition had even been dispatched and an Israeli request for jet fighters, possibly made on June 5, somehow becomes jet fighters sent to Israel.

If you blcok me, I will continue to send you these messages and when i am unblocked, the fires from hell will be unleashed upon wikipedia. 

you want to see some vandalism?

just as i did with Islam, Christianity and miracle whip in the past, i will do to anything i see with your fucking faggot ass signature on it.

seriously?

do you have to be such a whinny, cock sucking dickhead?

can you even respond to these?

it doesn't seem like it.

you just put all this horseshit on here and think that your place of authority on wikipedia makes you a big person? you're probably that kid that people thought would kill everyone in high school.

really? 

i hope you get blocked from wiki edits.

fuck you to death.",1
