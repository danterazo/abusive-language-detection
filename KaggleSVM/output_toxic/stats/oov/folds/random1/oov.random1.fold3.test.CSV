"Beer? 

Hi Matthew,  I'm in London July 25 to August 4.  I think we should have our annual beer.  Incidentally I'm in Finland  at the moment attending DebConf5.  The travel advice suggested a cheap way of getting to Helsinki is to fly to Estonia and take the short ferry trip across the water.  But then I thought I'm probably on some Estonian customs black list.  The prospect of a strip search by enthusiastic friends of he who does not want to be identified as an Estonian customs officer made me think again:  I flew direct.  Imagine:  By Wikipedia rules if they missed the four opportunities (in and out, in and out) they could catch up with me 10 months later.  Yes, I know, the logic escapes me too.",0

I don't think you get it. Why would it be biased when no one is trying to exclude counter examples? As I said, if you find any counter example go ahead and include them. No one is pushing any POV except maybe you, which is what it begins to sound like. You are reading too much into this. When US presidents reaffirm the """"One China"""" principle, they are in accordance with their country's official policy, it's not a mistake nor does it create controversy. When the Vatican invited only ROC president to John Paul II's funeral but not PRC officials, it was also done according to its own diplomatic policy, there is nothing controversial about that. Like I did before, I've always said """"mistake"""" isn't the right word from the get go, nor is it """"slip of tongue"""". Instead of going in circles and nitpicking, why not just change the title.

Thanks.  I nearly drowned when I was shoved overboard by some vindictive psychopath, but somehow I managed to swim back on board S.S Titanic.  Ironic really, given what I see coming up ahead.  Perhaps I should have saved myself the trouble, and just stayed in the icy water.

Your comments are interesting and may well be correct, however they don't really address the point I was making, regarding the gross, almost embarrassingly obvious, errors in the """"academic geek created/mindless computer driven"""" financial models currently used around the world.  The most similar """"theory"""" to the one I've pustulated above comes out of  this piece from """"The Prophet"""" Robert K. Landis, where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis.  Ludwig von Mises obviously had similar ideas, but no one has really done the """"hard"""" financial modelling on this Austrian School theory, and tried to collect long-term historical data, tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels (the frequency and severity of so-called """"black swan events"""") in financial markets.  My hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels, you will see bifurcating bell curve returns (i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns, with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness).

Landis comes close, but still no (Cuban) cigar.  Anyway, his piece is very topical right now, and made for interesting bedtime reading, tucked away here as I am in my tiny little third class cabin, far far away from the """"mad money"""" crowd.  """,0

That was really mean. Family Guy and King of the Hill are good shows, but so is KP. Don’t get hostile. =D

The intro paragraphs are good, but they could be a lot better.  I think that right now there's too much of a technical sound to it, as opposed to something more educational and inviting to people trying to learn about the subject.  I'd just like you to compare/contrast with the following paragraph, which is how evolution is introduced in a Bio101 textbook:

(Fair use excerpts follows)
Evolution originated with Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species...He argued from evidence that the species of organisms inhabiting Earth today descended from ancestral species.  Second, he proposed a mechanism for evolution which he termed natural selection, the idea that organisms can change over the generations if individuals having certain heritable traits leave more offspring than other individuals.  ..In modern terms, we would say that the genetic composition of the population had changed over time, and that is one way of defining evolution.  But we can also use the termin evolution on a much grander scale to mean all of the biological history, from the earliest microbes to the enormous diversity of modern organisms.

An understanding of evolution informs every field of biology, and applications of evolutionary biology are transforming medicine, agriculture, biotechnology and conservation...Evolution integrates all of biology.
(above is for example purposes onlywe can't use this in the article.)

We can't use the above since it would be fair-use, but do you see what I mean about making the article more accessible?

Another thing I'd note about the above example is that it also makes Evolution sound more exciting.  Just because we are an encyclopedia doesn't mean we can't put the subject in the exciting, important context that it deserves.

We could use something closer to the above, and then dive into a description of how the Theory of Evolution (what you might call a description of the fact of evolution that's described above) has developed from Darwin's original theory to modern-day explanations (and at the same time state how the question of whether evolution occurs has been a relatively incontroversial fact amongst biologists for the better part of a century).",0

{{unblock|1=
Ruslik0 is incorrect in his block of me. I wasn't edit waring as defined by Wikipedia: I made one reversion of an edit today.

Furthermore, Ruslik0 is incorrect that I made a false accusation regarding the objective fact that Jeffro77 is engaging in vandalism: Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal). That is quite a significant amount.

 Agnew early career 

I'm a bit loath to edit the Agnew article when you and TRM are making such as good job of putting it into some order. But as someone thought the early career stuff was a bit thin you might be interested in a snippet I found in The Times about his injury-proneness early on. It's from the issue of 28 October 1980 under the heading """"Another setback for Agnew"""" (page 9, issue No 60761) and reads:
The promising Leicestershire fast bowler, Jonathan Agnew, aged 22 [sic], is being flown home from Australia after contracting glandular fever. He was to have spent the winter playing for a club side.
Mike Turner, the Leicestershire secretary-manager, said: """"It's a great disappointment because Jonathan had just returned to his best form after battling for 12 months to recover from a back injury.""""
I'll go on perusing copies of The Times from his early cricket days and will post anything sensible I find here, or on the talk page if you prefer.   """,0

"""I had nearly moved on when I felt completely compelled to comment on this statement """"probably better than most clan websites, which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the 19th century. Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. Especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles"""". I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being """"bastardized"""" as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate """"sourced"""" information. There is substantial """"factually accurate"""" sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an """"opposing view"""". There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were """"out-documented"""" by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.

"I never said it would happen. I just said that I wouldn't be suprsed if it does. I made that guess based on everything that's happened so far in Naruto, and the way Kishimoto creates plot twists of this kind. Now your comment is what seems fanboyish and unjustifiable. Kabuto already seemed to have a kind of kind of second nature back during the first part of the series where his eyes would change color when he got mad. Kishimoto wouldn't give him a similar state to Juugo, because it wouldn't be something that new and because he wouldn't want to have two characters be so similar. And as for my Orochimaru possesing Itachi theory, just because something happens at one point doesn't mean it will be the same story next time. By your logic, just because Kakashi needed the help of his students (look 2-3 people right there!) to bail him out of Zabuza's trap during their first meeting, that would mean Zazbuza could have easily killed him during their second meeting when they were fighting alone. Or just because even Gaara's own father, the Kazekage himself, feared Gaara's power, a genin like Naruto shouldn't have been able to beat him let alone after he transformed. Or how could the Uchiha, being the strongest clan of Konoha, be killed so easily by a single member of their village? See? You definetly chose the wrong story to bring up that kind of logic. Practically every single fight in Naruto craps all over it. Orochimaru COULD take over Kabuto, and go on to Itachi after Sasuke's team has weakened him. Perhaps they cause him to overuse his Sharingan eyes, who knows? Orochimaru could find him, make his move, steal his body, and seek vengeance on Sasuke. The point is just that neither of us knows whats gonna happen and we'll just have to read the story.",0

I think your understanding is incorrect.  LR(1) grammars are also parseable in O(n) time; see: Knuth, D. (1965) """"On the translation of languages from left to right."""" Information and Control, 8, 607639.  LR languages are strictly more powerful: every LL(1) grammar is LR(1).  The converse is not true: grammars containing left recursion may be LR(1) but not LL(1).

In short, LR(1) parsers are strictly more powerful, but more difficult to write.  That's why parser-generators for LR(1) and related classes, are popular.

I think you might be confusing LR(1) with """"generalized LR"""" or """"GLR"""".  This algorithm can parse any context free grammar in worst-case O(n^3), but is vastly more powerful than either LR(1) or LL(1)  in fact, you can reduce any instance of binary matrix multiplication to an instance of context-free (and hence GLR) parsing, so we'll unlikely to ever find an algorithm that runs faster than the fastest matrix-multiplication algorithm.

Like the CFers, I don’t think voting defines this issue, particularly when critical information has been withheld from the voters.  Let's look at tat briefly...

From the Wiki page on pseudoscience we find:

“As it is taught in certain introductory science classes, pseudoscience is any subject that appears superficially to be scientific or whose proponents state is scientific but nevertheless contravenes the testability requirement, or substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.[3]”

From the Wiki page on the scientific method, we find:

“Among other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.”

From my comments in the “Bias on both sides” section on this page we find:

The assertion that published studies on He in ‘cold fusion’ experiments came from air leaks, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

and:

The assertion that heavy metals found in cold fusion experiments comes from a) contaminants or b) improper analysis of data, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

And from my other comments on calorimetry (incl. edits to the CF  Wiki page), we find:

The assertion that apparent excess heat arises from an analytical method problem, that the CFers exclude these concerns based on a dislike of a proposed speculative physical/chemical mechanism that might or might not be a source of a calibration constant shift problem, while ignoring the mathematical fact that a 1-3% change in cal. constants can account for the large majority of such heat claims.  One fundamental aspect of the scientific method is the concept that if two alternative explanations exist for a given set of observations, then the situation is undefined and more new work must be done designed to test each alternative and distinguish between the two, because two distinct, conflicting explanations for a phenomenon can’t both be correct.  Failure to do that substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.  Failure to incorporate a viable alternative into experimental protocols produces a biased interpretation of the results.

I think that it is important to mention national syndicalism at the beginning, as that eliminates a good amount of the problems with temporality associated with some of the more generalizing and overarching terms that have been suggested.
As for the left-right thing, it should be apparent that national syndicalism itself was a nationalistic movement, but the economics they embraced were not generally what would be considered """"right wing"""". I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It's probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to """"national syndicalism"""" should facilitate, than oversimplify.
Regarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing). It should be borne in mind that the WWII-era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi-fascist Japan formed the """"axis"""", for example, so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me, though ethnocentrism sounds plausible. Just because it sounds plausible, however, does not mean that there are RS describing it as such. Militarism is a common thread, but how does monumental architecture relate to that? The sentence seems somewhat forced, so there has to be a concrete source connecting those in an intelligible manner. 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0

I am not taking advice from either of you.  This is a conversation between me and the administrator. The only problem I see is that obnoxious and confrontational editors like Verbal are given free reign, and in the process they drive other editors off the site.  I've offered my advice:  (1) stop valuing the input of Wiki-addicts like Verbal, and start valuing the input of productive editors; (2) place a daily limit on the number of posts to discourage Wiki-addiction; and (3) ask editors not to make extensive edits to subjects they know nothing about.  Until that is done, the warring on Wikipedia will continue, and knowledgeable editors will continue to be driven off the site  and the articles will suffer.  23:03",0

1. The Patchett AfD was logged [here]

Obviously I can't say for certain how Dan came to edit the page, and I have no idea at all if he would recognise the name and follow through after seeing it in the log, nor if he even saw the log, but I can say that there are other possibilities than the one LibStar suggests. Unless LibStar has other evidence that isn't posted here, I don't really see how he or she can be so confident that Dan is in the wrong. ¶ Now, for the record, before I'm accused of something, I'll note that I've been editing some of the same pages as Dan since 2007.

In the Medieval sourcebook edition of Newburgh, the sentence reads """"The young men, however, spurred on by wrath, feared not, and inflicted a wound upon the senseless carcass, out of which incontinently flowed such a stream of blood, that it might have been taken for a leech filled with the blood of many persons.""""

(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history
One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.

Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern """"Slavic"""" and """"Dalmatian"""" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).

Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.

The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc",0

 WP:FILM coordinator 

Hey, I saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for WP:FILM concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more. I'm a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. Is it largely updating , reviewing articles, and aiding in the establishment of task forces (at least as far as I can see)? Do coordinators generally specialize in various areas (i.e. one handles task forces, others reviewing, or a combination of any such duties)? If so, I was wondering whether I could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. I rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all Wikipedians, and I have a very good grasp of what is required for FL status. If I was elected, I probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under WP:FILM's scope, and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to FL status with a coordinated effort. That said, I understand that I'm relatively new to the film project, and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project. Just curious as to your thoughts on the matter. Cheers,  (converse) """,0

 Criticism Section - Not Clutch 

This section is basically about how Arod is not considered to be clutch. The section is outdated and irrelevant due to his performance in the 2009 playoffs. No one debates whether or not he is clutch anymore. This entire section should be deleted. Does anyone disagree?  — (talk • contribs)  
I'm thinking about this.  Some of it could be kept, if put in a historical perspective.  But it is clearly over the top as it is.   
I just reread this section, and it's completely outdated. I still think it should be removed in it's entirety.   
Some of it needs to be kept.  Let's discuss what should stay and what should go.  I'm totally okay with reducing the size of it, but it needs to be mentioned.   
I made some dramatic changes to the section, trying to shorten it and update it.  Also, I've tried to reorganize the section as it had obviously grown organically over a long period.  My efforts are by no means stellar, and I suggest people look at the section with new eyes to see how to further improve it.  
It is, at the least, a good start.  Thank you.  I'll take a closer look at it later.   
Nice updates. The section seems relevant again.   
I made some minor copyedits to the section. I think the section ought to stay included  it's part of Arod's historical record that he's come under fire for being """"un-clutch"""" (ludicrous as those criticisms may have been). I'm also going to remove the tag suggesting integrating the section elsewhere  the section hardly gives undue weight to the controversy, which extended over a period of several years and occupied who-knows-how-many back pages in the sports press. bomb 

 Range Factor 

The range factor claims currently tagged as as """"citation needed"""" can be verified on ESPN's page (and probably elsewhere). The claims as stated are accurate and verifiable. I'd add the cite, but on second thought I question whether it's really a useful thing to state. It makes it sound like that's the final word on his defense, which it surely isn't. Range factor isn't the only defensive stat, and A-Rod does not rank last on many of the others. To cite it exclusively feels like you're trying to push a point of view criticizing him defensively. (Also, even on range factor, in 2004 and 2005 he was tied for last, not alone.)   

 """"Youngest to hit 600"""" 

This stat is misleading, while he may be the youngest to achieve this he took an above average time to do so. He played 183 more games than Babe Ruth. Because Rodriguez started playing baseball at a much earlier age than many of the greats should be noted. He is a good player, but statements concerning his age should be taken out. Games played/Seasons are a better barometer of talent than age.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 170.123.4.230

 Notable != Important 

Hello, . Please don't use the word """"important"""" when talking about notability, as you did at WP:HD#Zeeshan haider. In this case it probably doesn't matter, because the issue is that the article doesn't make a claim of notability. But when an article is deleted (or rejected) because the subject is not notable, new users often come back with something like """"How can you say X isn't important?!"""" The answer is that that isn't what we're saying: 'notable' has a technical meaning in Wikipedia, and does not mean 'important', 'influential', 'popular', or any of the other things that people might interpret it as being in the normal sense.

RE: the questions raised above
are they important economically? - they use to be the main timber export from SE Asia. I don't have figures for what % of the timber trade they account for now
what minerals or grounds they need?- variable - there is a high degree of habitat speacilsation. Some species only occur in Peatswamps, other in poor sand soils i.e. heath forests, others on rich clay soils.
what animals eat their seeds? - when they fruit, which varies from yearly in some of the Sri Lankan species to onces every x (2-16) years in some of the Borneo species - they are an important food source.

Someone needs to get the correct pictures back after some idiot decided to replace the pictures with pictures of woman. I fixed most of the references in the text though(they changed them to female as well i.e. actress/her).  16:12,  18 March 2006(UTC)
Done. I'm sure vandalism will increase the closer we get to the film being released. Just beware.. 

Born during the Bond film series
I know that Craig was born the year after the release of You Only Live Twice and the year before On Her Majesty's Secret Service, am I right? I just put down """"a year before On Her Majesty's Secret Service."""" He was born in the Sean Connery era right, not George Lazenby?
It's correct, but I wouldn't say Lazenby had an era at all.  
I would say Sean Connery era because he returned in Diamonds are Forever in 1971 after Lazenby in OHMSS. Lazenby did not have an era. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

Introduction to US audiences
I don't know if it's correct to say that the Lara Croft film introduced him to American audiences. I remember hearing some buzz about him in Elizabeth which while it didn't do Lara Croft-level box office, was still a substantial success in North America. Thoughts?  

I hadn't heard about that, but it's no big deal to me either way. I made the change because the text as it stood made it seem that Road to Perdition was his first introduction to US audiences, which on the evidence of Tomb Raider was manifestly untrue. If there is clear evidence of Elizabeth'''s priority, I have no problem with that.  
I'm not familiar enough with Elizabeth to be certain. I do know it was listed as one of his career highlights more often than Tomb Raider when he was announced as Bond; the only time I saw Tomb Raider connected to him in the media was when it was rumored Angelina Jolie was up for the role of Vesper.  

While it's probably the better film — and was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar — from memory his role in Elizabeth is a relatively minor one. Certainly he wasn't one of the main stars (who were pretty much Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes and Craig's Our Friends in the North'' co-star Christopher Eccleston).

Ernie Smith writes 

Æµ§œš¹ I attempted to address the question that you posed regarding other inaccuracies but at the behest of User Hoary I have been blocked by the Wikipedia administrators.  That said, you should carefully examine what I did in fact state regading the four ways that Baugh posits as being the Afrocentric proponent's view on Ebonics.  I maintain that just because a writer happens to be Black or African American (Weddington, Baugh and Green for example) being Black does not make their postion on Ebonics Afrocentric.  What I stated was that; """"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.""""  I went on to state that """"In fact, a careful analysis of what Baugh posits as number (iii) reveals that this view is not Afrocentric at all.  That is, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric.  The other three views, numbers (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric..."""" 

Æµ§œš¹, if you re-read the quote above carefully you will see that are clearly in error regarding what I stated concerning Baughs number (ii).  So let me make it clear here. It is my view that the first phrse in number (ii)that reads; """"to refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole”, is definitely Afrocentric.  What I questioned was the second phrase or clause in number (ii) that reads; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language|English: either”.  I contend that this phrase contradicts the first phrase and is therefore and oxymoron.  The fact that Eurocentric writers attempt to filch, redfine and use the word Ebonics to """"refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language"""" does not make this practice Afrocentric.

To User:DESiegel

I am indeed very well aware that languages change over time. In fact I co-authored a book on the origin of the """"N' word and in that book I extensivly addressed how the meaning of the Kemetic (Egyptian)word NGR has changed.  In this book Shaba Shebaka and I systematically demonstrate that while all English language dictionaries posit the origin of the 'N' word as being derived from the Latin word 'niger' meaning 'black', (See Ullaman, et.al. Third Latin Book (1930:51) the word 'niger' is not originally a Latin word. (see America Heritage Dictionary (1976:1531) That is, while the word 'niger' may have entered into the English langange from Latin, the empirical evidence is that the tri-consonant Mdw Ntr 'NGR' is found in the ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) language thousnds of years before there is any record of a Latin civilization.  The empirical evidence is that the root word NGR was introduced to the Ayran or European people when they initially invaded and made contact with the Negroid people (NGRS) of ancient India around 2000-1000 BC. (See Wallbank and Taylor(1942:72,73)and Durant (1954:356).

In Sir E.A. Wallis Budge's Egypitian Hieroglyphic Dictionary the words NGRS and NGGR can be found in hieroglyphs.  Budge provides the specific site where these hieroglyphs are located in Egypt today.  As defined by Budge the first word NGRS is the name of an ancient Kemetic or Egyptian God (Budge 1978:341).  The second word NGGR is the name of an ancient Kemitic or Egyptian Goddess (Budge 1978:398).  For the Wikipedia reader that may be concerned as to the relavence of this discussion of the 'N' word to Ebonics I strongly urge the reader to examine the etymology and definition of the word """"ebony"""" in any unabridged English language dictionary. The point being made is that there is a subtle linguistic diglossia being imposed that must to be challenged.  Einar Haugen states the point I am making thusly:  """"if we call the building-up of a language an Aufbau and the aphasic dismantling an Abbau, the bilinguals restructuring can be call an Umbau.  This is the goal of all the studies if bilingual interference: in what way has a language been rebuilt or umgebaut because of the coexistence with another language in the minds ofbilingual speakers?""""  Of course to those who view Ebonics as being a dialect of English the idea of 'biligualism' when it comes to the languge of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans in diappora is unfathomable.

edit conflictMy Dear (though Furioso) Orlando: In the first diff,  has left you a message about """"Masem’s talk.""""  In my world, a """"talk"""" is a public lecture, typically given at a conference, convention, or educational institution. As you may recall, I gave one of these at Southampton last month on a topic of mutual interest.  In light of that, and of Masem’s Signpost article, I supposed that   referred to something of a similar nature that Masem had delivered. Asking for the citation seemed that natural and polite thing to do. It turns out, Vordox meant """"Masem’s talk page""""; I've seldom seen that usage in Wikipedia or elsewhere.

Now, to your point.  No one is claiming that the image of Muhammad is any more """"real"""" than the image of Qin Shi Huang.  They are both done in later times to represent an historical figure.

Agreement quite clearly states that if the war came to Baltic Sea then Finns were allowed to place troops to the island. And what do you know... Nazi Germany was at war and used Baltic sea making it legal under the demilitarization treaty for the Finns move troops there (technically they could have kept troops there the whole time - its not Finnish problem if SU cant understand treaty texts). Also there is no requirement for the Finland to participate into that war in order to allowed to place troops in Åland.

POBLACHT NA H EIREANN
___________________________
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
OF THE 
IRISH REPUBLIC 
TO THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND 

IRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN: In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom.

Having organised and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionary organisation, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military organisations, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, having patiently perfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for the right moment to reveal itself, she now seizes that moment, and, supported by her exiled children in America and by gallant allies in Europe, but relying in the first on her own strength, she strikes in full confidence of victory.

We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished except by the destruction of the Irish people. In every generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the last three hundred years they have asserted it to arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades-in-arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.

The Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims, the allegiance of every Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all of its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.

Until our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of a permanent National, representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women, the Provisional Government, hereby constituted, will administer the civil and military affairs of the Republic in trust for the people.

We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most High God. Whose blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice, in humanity, or rapine. In this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valour and discipline and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.

Signed on Behalf of the Provisional Government.

The wording of the most recent edit is needs tweaking. Reading the source provided, Hunter wrote in opposition of a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces, an unreliable Afghan Leadership, concerns regarding roadside bombs, and what he saw as """"Obama administration's other shortcomings"""" which he termed """"mixed messages"""" to American service members and the world. And as stated by the Administration in 2012, there are were no plans for a complete withdraw; which had changed as recently as recently as this month to possible withdrawal after 2014. Therefore, upon closer review the summarization of the source is wrong.
As for the second part, I would say the best way to word it would be something like:

Remember that an argument can be made that the Boston Tea party could qualify as a terrorist incident under some definitions. That is why I am suggesting we list all notable violent incidents and ongoing conflicts and let our readers decide whether they want to call a particular incident terrorism.

Hi Tavix. How are you doing? I think I need to ask you for your help, if you don't mind helping a newbie, since i can see that you've had experience in editing articles, and seem to be an authority on article qualification. Again, I'm new to wikipedia, and I have one purpose here, to have a page for the hockey league I belong to. I have read countless help articles, linking to other help articles, linking to more help articles.  I've read 'notibility', 'articles for deletion', 'deletion policy guidlines', in my efforts to save my page from the few people who seem to want the page gone forever. These people have not giving any advice, just citing everything that's wrong with the page, and nothing that is right.  Can I change your mind on windsor floor hockey league, and, your proposing on deleting it?  I would do whatever possible to comply with the rules of wikipedia and have read quite alot in the guidelines about why the page SHOULD be included. (so many, i donno where to begin -social & recreational clubs have a place on wiki -  -Included in the article is a physical address of where the games take place, some article i read said that stands for something- there's alot of reasons why it SHOULD exist on wikipedia and about two or three small debatable issues about lack of notibility). I included all the league's website and pages, and it's not like anyone is debating the truthfulness of the article, but they do insist on citing the page for 1. notability, 2. More independant sources.

 Holodomor origin and use 

Hi, I'm sorry I referred to the topic in question as a 'conspiracy theory' - I need to learn to censor myself better on Wikipedia. -) 

In any case, I can share my experience with the word growing up in the Soviet Union in the 1980-90s. I was aware of the term ('Golodomor' in Russian transliteration) as the """"the great famine of early 1930s throughout the Soviet Union, predominantly in the Ukraine, but also in Southern Russia, due to the policies of the collectivisation and de-kulakization."""" There was no connection or comparisons to Holocaust in my mind, in part because the term Holocaust was not in use in the general discourse. It was as if WWII happened but Holocaust did not. That was really weird. 

Now, the term Holocaust in Russian is much more common. However, the two words look differently in Russian - Gogolomor and Holokost; so that's why (with my background) is hard to see a connection, although I'm more aware now of how it became a political rather than just a historic term. 

Hope this clarifies my perspective. Again, sorry about the choice of language on the Holodomor Talk page.

Germany and Austria have very limited protection for freedom of expression.  France is much the same, except that penalties tend to be less extreme.  England also has quite limited protection.  In fact, the concept """"freedom of speech"""" is barely understood, let alone respected, in Western Europe, despite much pretentious posturing.

 about your comment on Elaragirl's talk page 

Hello Dev920, I couldn't help but notice your comments on  talk page under the heading """"Esperanza"""", so I'm sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy (or Elaragirl's). I wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with Esperanza, and some editors, how shall I say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others.  As for the governance issue, I personally don't understand the current structure and I don't feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.

I still think that an off-Wikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on Esperanza's page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge, and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on Wikipedia. What's one more click of the mouse? Just so you know, I had participated a little in the coffee lounge, but I got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which I felt were sexist, offensive, and not at all belonging on Wikipedia. Because I had participated only to a limited extent, my overall edit count (2971 as of ) wasn't seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.

I had proposed a hypothetical merger between Esperanza, the Kindness Campaign, and Concordia, and while I still think that many of their stated goals overlap, I also feel that Esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger, and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. I was unaware that Esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. If you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant, chalk it up to my own shortsightedness, not to Esperanza as a whole.

I know that we may differ in our views of what to do with Esperanza, but at least the MfD and in particular comments by you, Elaragirl, and others, have given the impetus for Esperanza to examine itself. Thank you for that.

Since I've typed this much, I might as well invite you to review me at editor review. Thanks again for your participation in all of this.  """,0

 Confused about how members are selected 

I'm a bit confused how the members are selected. I know each has to be approved individually, but how exactly are they nominated (self nominated?)? Are only the appropriate number for each region nominated or is it possible to have more then the total allowed for a region nominated? If it's possible to have more then the total, and more then the total are approved, how exactly are the states which will actually be on the council selected (e.g. based on the votes received). Finally, whatever the case, what happens if not enough states are selected/approved from a region?  

I hink that they are self-nominated because there were more candidates then mandates to disperse.  

To address your questions in order:
They are all self-nominated. The countries have to volunteer, and they have to invite observers into their countries to check how their own human rights record actually is.
It is possible, and intended, that more than the alotted number of slots nominate themselves; else, why vote if we have exactly as many candidates as slots?
As has happened for the Western European and Others Group, the ones with the most votes in support are selected. (None of the candidates from the WEaOG got less than 50% approval, but Greece and Portugal got the smalles number of votes, I believe.)
Hope this explains it. — (?) """,0

Ancestry and racial origin are interchangeable and means the same thing. There is no need to play on words, but thank you for the feedback Rossrs, I appreciate yours. As for Mr.Wild, Well wildie she is not 1/4 this or 1/4 that, since when was this theory? Talk about sticking to the topic, You can look at the woman and see she is black! Her father is black! Her mother is part black! . Where is the complexity?? You want to get nitty gritty she mentions black 3 times and Puerto Rican once. That would make her 1/8th Puerto Rican if you want to go so far and that has nothing to do if it's black Puerto Rican lineage or otherwise.There's nothing complicated the only complication are you(zealot editors), who choose to use give blind allegiance to your clan members opinions  other than what is truth then turn around and hide under """"POV-pushing and much to-do over nothing."""" To get off topic a bit, Barack obama was a nigger, NOT nigga, but a Nigger up till Nov 4th or when it became apparent he was to become POTUS no.44. After that he then became mixed, then bi-racial then finally half white ,not half black mind you, but half white. Some person or persons feel very proud that this young lady has a trace of Puerto Rican lineage in her family tree and I have absolutely no objection with that naturally. But its just that,a trace, there is no need for a Puerto rican ascendancy with a link of Puerto Rican actresses and definitely no need to be stating Puerto Rican as a defining characteristic of her. It's trivial for she is far from being Puerto Rican both culturally and genetically. If anything there should be a native Amerindian link. Put the shoe on the other foot and this young lady was four shades lighter and possessed 1/8th African heritage and 'looked' Nordic. Would a link for African American actresses be up there? Would Black be mention first even if she had said it first??? You can bet your ass not! And you know it! I doubt it would even be mentioned. Matter of fact when I'm done here I'm heading over to the John Mccain page to kick up some dusk   for inclusion of his black ancestry, yes sir. And guess what else Mr.wild? I know just what you look like; WHITE. And you know what else Wildly? With your dismissive attitude I am even more certain than ever that you are very much a racist appeaser.

"An alluvial plain is a relatively flat and gently sloping landform found at the base of a range of hills or mountains, formed by the deposition of alluvial soil over a long period of time by a rivers coming from the mountains.

As the hills erode due to weathering and water flow the sediment from the hills is transported to the lower plain. Various creeks will carry the water further to a river, lake, bay, or ocean. As the sediments are deposited during flood conditions in the floodplain of a creek, the elevation of the floodplain will be raised. As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will over time seek new, lower paths, forming meanders (a curving sinuous path). The leftover higher locations, typically natural levees at the margins of the flood channel, will themselves be eroded by lateral stream erosion and from local rainfall and possibly wind transport if the climate is arid and does not support soil-holding grasses. These processes over geologic time will form the plain - a region with little relief (local changes in elevation), yet with a constant but small slope.",0

Extracted guidlelines of note from sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2:

To be avoided
 Switching between major citation styles, e.g., switching between parenthetical and  tags or between the style preferred by one academic discipline vs. another

Generally considered helpful
 Imposing one style on an article with incompatible citation styles (e.g., some of the citations in footnotes and others as parenthetical references): an improvement because it makes the formatting consistent

By following GA-criteria I am led, with no uncertainty, to a sound conclusion and made the reasonable request that all references be made consistent. They are currently a mixed bag of s and . Per WP:CITEVAR this is avoidable and unhelpful, and therefore unacceptable, in my opinion it fails the GAN requirement to follow MOS:LAYOUT closely enough.

You're both right in the sense that enough is enough. If you haven't noticed, I've hardly contributed a thing to the RefDesk in quite a while. If you also haven't noticed, many other valuable editors who used to contribute regularly just, say, a year ago, are now long gone. I suppose I was left the only one to hold the fort. It's now clear, however, that you simply don't appreciate what's happening here, and no matter how hard I try, you never will.

I know this will be futile, but I'll explain how I see things one last time: The Humanities RefDesk used to be a wonderful place to learn. OPs would ask questions, and a decent variety of intellectuals would put in their admittedly POV two-cents, with the result of providing the OP with a variety of differing POV answers, which is basically the closest one can get to an NPOV answer to any """"humanities"""" related topic. This was the Humanities RefDesk I fell in love with.

Now, however, it's pretty much dominated by one supposed omniscient Cambridge Phd. One who verbally abuses other editors in the cruelest and most sadistic of manners due to the """"folly"""" she percieves in their contributions (while the admins conveniently turn a blind eye). One who is incapable of those all-too-human facets known as humilty and fallability. This editor proceeds upon handing down, as if from above, her more-often-than-not flawed, revisionist, biased, and downright incorrect responses (and from my own ethnic POV, extremely offensive and insulting to the memory of my family) to historical questions. When these responses are succesfully challenged, she is incapable of responding in a civil manner (not just to me) and lowering herself to """"stand corrected"""".

These, to me, are not the makings of a RefDesk editor, nor a proper historian. 

But once again, you're right. Enough is enough. I've spent far too much time and effort on this. If you'd indeed prefer the Humanities RefDesk to degenerate into a ClioBlog, then that last obstacle you've been facing, little old Loomis51, has given up. I fought the good fight, and I'm damned proud of it. This, to me, is truly a sad day for Wikipedia.

This is no grand exit, no demand to be blocked, nothing melodramatic like that. I still love Wikipedia and its articles. Unfortunately that once great Humanities RefDesk that I couldn't wait to come to visit upon returning home from work, in order to learn new things, and (hopefully) return the favour by sharing whatever I know with others, is no longer. 

I'm not really sure what all those nonsensical """"conditions"""" you noted above were, nor did I pay much attention to them. Whether my words above are some sort of """"breach"""" of those conditions, I have no idea, nor do I care. 

I just can't help but find it funny that you've extended your jurisdiction to Wikiversity. What's next? If you can somehow hack into my Yahoo account, will my emails now be scrutinized for any anti-Clio content? How about MSN? Is it ok if I call Stu up on the phone and speak """"inappropriately"""" of her? lol (Not that either of us really cares about all this bullshit to actually talk on the phone about it, we have lives, you know! We've never even spoken on the phone, and interestingly, I know rather little about him except that he's apparently from Detroit and that we disagree on pretty much every issue except for the fact that Clio's a fraud! I'm actually rather curious. I've often wondered if Stu is perhaps some obese Asian guy, some skinny Black guy, some white senior citizen, or whatever!) 

If you want to block me, then block me. If you don't, then don't. It's all so obviously arbitrary that I really don't give a shit at this point what you do. All you should know is that I'm just pretty much fed up with the whole RefDesk farce, and I don't really see myself engaging in it in any way any time soon. I have absolutely no intention of any further """"Doctor Anastasia"""" bashing, as like I said, it's futile. If you don't believe me, then block me. If not, then don't. Do as you please.

Let me just mark this day, June 4th, 2007. Let's just see how the Humanities RefDesk looks in say, six months from now: December 4th, 2007. Will all be as is? Will any of my remarks ring any truer? Let's just see. In the meantime, adios muchachos!

Diacritics: Moving forward

I too have no very clear idea about how to word an RfC, other than that it should be in relation to specific proposed changes to the MOS and not something vaguer. I also think it's very important to keep to the issue of diacritical marks in the original orthography of the language, and not stray into either additional letters (like eth or thorn) or the use of diacritical marks in transcription/transliteration (like retaining accents when going from πότε to póte or marking long vowels by macrons in transliterating a number of languages, including Greek and Japanese). These are separate issues.

The problems, for me, are primarily in the first paragraph of WP:DIACRITICS, which is evasive, muddled and inconsistent:
 – this is just evasion. Their use or non-use should be motivated, and hence should be encouraged or discouraged according to the strength of the motivation.
 – this encouragement to count """"hits"""" just results in muddled policy, apart from the problem of the weasel word """"general"""". However, this bit seems clear that the """"modifications"""" are to the same word, i.e. can be treated as stylistic modifications.
 This seems to me not to be consistent with the sentence before: is """"the common name"""" here supposed to be with or without the added diacritical marks? """"[V]ersions of  word"""" above should mean that """"the common """" is the same with or without the diacritical marks.
Is it possible to re-write this paragraph to achieve consensus? I don't know.   

 Agreed those are separate issuesAgreed the first quoted passage is evasive, but motivating use or avoidance of diacritics seems to be the sticking point.  Did you have some particular direction in mind?  My take has been that if reliable sources show that their use is normal for the names in question that they should be used here, except where particular subjects eschew them. E.g. for a baseball player named Eddie Sandoval we'd give him as Eddie Sándoval if some reliable sources did (it can't be based on a majority of English language sources, since majority of them ignore diacritics entirely, as a matter of editorial/publishing convenience). It's the same principle that we can cite a single source for Eddie's birth date and place even if most sources don't mention them.  A fact does not have to be provided by every single source to be considered reliable.  And it's not a matter of sources conflicting (analogous to giving two different birth dates); some giving only Sandoval without the diacritics is like some sources giving a birth year but not a full birth date; it is incomplete information, not conflicting information.  On the other hand, if Eddie himself is quoted saying he doesn't use the diacritic that should be a trumping factor (unless WP totally ditches subject preference in all areas, which seems unlikely given the number of discussions going on to make more allowances for subject preference all over the place).  This can apply to geography, too (Santa Fe, New Mexico is """"Santa Fe"""" not """"Santa Fé"""" despite the popularity of the diacritic in certain circles; the official name of both the city and the county are """"Santa Fe"""" with no accent. People frequently cite WP:OFFICIALNAME as if it were a policy, but it's actually just an essay, it may not accurately reflect the nuances in cases like this, and people often cite it without actually understanding what it says to begin with (it's frequently misinterpreted as being against use of official names, when it's really only against using them when they're directly unhelpful to readers, while otherwise we would almost certainly use the official name)I'm not sure """"general"""" in the second passage is actually a weasel word, rather than just lack of clarity.  It's not clear if it means the predominant use in reliable sources generally, the predominant use in general-audience sources, or both.  The inclusion of """"and reference works"""" strongly suggests the former.  Regardless, the """"hit-counting"""" aspect is a problem because of the aforementioned facts that a) English-language sources tend to ignore diacritics for their own conven",0

 Re: Discussions on fair use 
I wish I could point you to where these discussions are taking place. Except for WP:AN & it's mate WP:AN/I, & intermittently on the WikiEN-l mailling list, I don't know where this is being discussed. Maybe also at Wikipedia:Village Pump. And, IMHO, those fora appear to be full of people who are against fair use entirely, so they may not listen to an opposing voice. 

I find this whole campaign against any fair use materials discouraging  although sometimes I am too pessimistic about things, both related to Wikipedia or not. The rule  as long as I've contributed to Wikipedia  is that non-free materials may be used specifically to help identify its subjects. Examples would include the flag logo with Microsoft Windows, or the """"death star"""" logo with AT&T; (to name 2 US-centric ones). How else would one identify the Led Zeppelin album with the weird runes that some people label """"ZOZO""""? Beyond that, the rules become fuzzy very quickly (e.g., can one use a screencap to help identify significant commercials?), & I simply feel that those cases are not worth the effort to del with. (To give another example, I have a book or two that were published in the mid-1960s in Ethiopia  at which time, from what I've been able to determine, the country had no functional copyright law. We could have weeks & weeks of fun deciding those cases.)

These are removed because you guys don't like primary sources? This is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with Wikipedia. My wife is pregnant. I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the """"first do no harm"""" idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   

 I'm sorry that I've upset you, but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. That is why we've written WP:MEDRS which I pointed to when I reverted you. There is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at WP:WHYMEDRS. The fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results can't be transferred into clinical practise. MEDRS is no catch all, but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. I would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically, for example by having FDA warnings automatically added.

 Rescue 

The reason I spend my time rescuing articles, even ones that paid editors have apparently been involved with, is because 1) the intention is to transform the article into something neutral and non-promotional, which is better for Wikipedia than no content at all if the subject is appropriate for inclusion, 2) it doesn't actually matter what paid editors work on because that doesn't change what sources do or don't exist on that subject nor does it change editors' ability to appraise those sources and 3) Even though I am against paid editing, I dislike the idea of deleting articles on the basis of a paid editor having been involved with them when there is potential for improvement.

Reckless, the policy and guideline were both updated last year to move away from the era of small screens and slow downloads; this was around the time en.WP sucessfully pushed the Foundation techs to move the whole 300 projects, gradually, from 180px to 220px default thumbnail size: great!). In fact, for readers with slow connections it's often better to have a larger display in an article, so they are less likely to need to double-click on the original; originals are often huge and take much longer to download. I am generalising here, and individual cases need to be judged on their merits. BTW, I encourage all editors to arrange and size images WRT narrow-to-wide window widths and font sizes/skins, etc. Just move your window through from narrow to wide to see what a difference it makes in the way text and pics interact.

The kalpa is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā (8.17): sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ. One day of Brahmā is called a kalpa. A yuga, or mahā-yuga, consists of 4,320,000 years, and one thousand such mahā-yugas constitute one kalpa.

In a PR Opsens Inc. announced an order from BAE Systems for the supply of RadSens-type signal conditioners and OTG-R-type fiber optic temperature sensors. 
It follows recent approval of these products obtained from the [Defence Ordnance Safety Group] (DOSG), an organization of the UK [Ministry of Defence]. It did not specify what these are for, they could be engine monitoring of course.

 Comments from RHB 

I am approaching this as someone who knows very little about the subject. I will give some high-level comments mainly on structure and content. There are copyediting and prose issues as well, but it is probably worthwhile to tackle the general problems before going into specifics. Before I start, one general point that you will see often in my comments is that there are at times new subjects that are suddenly introduced. Although wikilinks help, a clause or a few words of explanation would smooth the flow of reading for a person not familiar with the subject.

Background to the mission
This section seems a little long relative to the rest of the article. Unless there is a significant expansion planned for the rest of the article, I would recommend reducing this section. There are small details that do not add very much to the Augustine story, e.g., the origin of St Martin’s Church, the fair-haired slaves theory, the pope writing to various kings.
Bede is suddenly introduced without explanation.

Arrival and first efforts
The mission turning back to Rome is not explained. Is there a significance to what happened?
It says “…on the one hand… on the other hand…” but the two items mentioned do not seem to be in opposition as expected when this phrasing is used.
Augustine established first at Canterbury. Since he was the originator, it might be good to give a reason why he chose the location.
The Archbishop of Arles is suddenly introduced. Who is he? Was he based in Arles (in modern-day France) or in Kent? The existence of an Archbishop implies a significant Christian population existing on British soil. This then brings more questions to mind.
It says """"That Christmas…"""". But what year is that?
The king became a saint after his death, but the sentence may be in the wrong place. Did the king die shortly after Augustine's arrival?
In the same paragraph, some information of the existence of Christians before Augustine's arrival is given. This info should go before the discussion of Augustine's arrival.
Mellitus and Justus are suddenly introduced without explanation.
The sentence """"A theory by the historian S. Brechter…"""" is either a run-on sentence or is incomplete.

Additional work
After the first sentence describing the two episcopal sees, there is a sudden jump to after 1066 and a discussion of a cathedral. How are they linked? Also what cathedral is it? The description of the archeology seems out of place in the """"Additional work"""" section. Is it meant to show that Augustine managed to build new churches?
If Aethelbert was only the King of Kent, how was he able to summon bishops outside his realm?
There is a sudden introduction of the tonsure.

Further success
Concerning """"temples and usages"""" is that """"temples and their use""""? The """"former… latter"""" construct does not work very well here.
Concerning the quote """"whoever wishes…"""", who said that?

I would recommend reading the article out loud. I think you will find some sentence structures that seem a bit complex or difficult to understand. Following the corrections, a good copyedit/prose check is needed. I give as an example, the sentence """"As to why Pope Gregory…"""" could be made better as in """"Nothing is mentioned in the sources on why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission"""".

I hope this has been helpful.   """,0

 A tag has been placed on Palero requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

"de Moivre's formula is currently grossly incorrect 

My corrections were perfectly valid whereas the previous (and now current) version of the page are wrong in their majority.

Un-fortuitously I am unaware of any books that provide a proof beyond an integer power but I have already provided a proof and if you find that insufficient I can provide you with other internet sources that cite it. I can understand and forgive a non-mathematical page containing errors as non-mathematical phenomena are not clear cut nor are they ever entirely obvious and often it is plausible to find support for all sets of contradicting information. However this is not the case with mathematics which is the only subject that can have all of its information conclusively proved or disproved. As such maths should never be quoted incorrectly in any Wikipedia article as it is extremely black and white, i.e; things are either purely correct or incorrect and as it stands my corrections were correct whereas the current page reversion is not. I am amazed at how this page is able to pertain information of such mass, gross inaccuracy especially given the simplicity of de Moivre's theorem and the prerequisites needed to understand it. It is after all something that all students of complex numbers by extension of studying further mathematics learn at the age of 16 in England, UK.

 """"Further reading"""" 

Hallo Wikisjt3: I've seen some discussion on various talk pages about this. (,  - just to run this past your eyes too.)

The church already has an article, at St. Mary of the Visitation Catholic Church (Huntsville, Alabama), as it's on the NRHP. (It's unfortunate that the book title doesn't identify which """"St Mary of the Visitation"""" church it's about, but I traced it with a bit of detective work: Alabama was mentioned somewhere, there's a helpful disambiguation page at St. Mary's Church, there's only one listed in Alabama, and the church website confirms this book as being about this church.)

I've added this book as """"Further reading"""" (sourced from the Worldcat record), which I think seems appropriate even though the book does not see WP:NOTABLE enough to have its own article. Anyone wanting to learn more about the church now knows this book exists, and can link the isbn to trace the catalog record in Worldcat and perhaps elsewhere. 

It may be that there is some more information which could usefully be added to the article about the church, sourced to the book (as far as I  know the book would qualify as a """"Reliable source""""). The article at present is entirely about the architecture of the building, not the history of the church as an organisation. In adding anything, remember to write in your own words and not copy the text of the book, which would be a breach of copyright. And please remember not to overwhelm readers with too much detail: less can be more if it lets the most important aspects shine out. D """,0

Here's a thought. You probably never contemplated that your actions against NLP would one day back fire against you such that your own dream model (and consequence business) will brought down (at best) or reduced (at worst). As I have and am continuing to zealously write to and track down every organisation you have advanced this model to, it stands to reason that you will not be getting any contract renewed. I am operating covertly, so these organisations will be writing back to me, giving me a chance to create doubt (nothing evil, much of it will be what I said to you). 

Why do I reveal my strategy to you?

1. You will find out anyway from different government bodies.

2. There is no fun in not telling you. This whole effort on my part takes an incredible lot of time and I must have fun!

3. I will never do anything evil. Everything I advance is the truth, backed by logic not emotion, in the interests of academic fair play.

You see, you can Not criticise """"another model"""" whilst concurrently advancing a mystic model yourself. Therein lays the problem and fallacy you play with. I would have no problem in you criticising NLP over the years if you were not therefore advancing a equally mystic model ! But [1] Cynefin and [2] your rejection of everything Richard Dawkins (and therefore Darwin) makes you de facto a mystic in the widest terms! As for """"2"""" you believe the lack of """"any"""" evidence is proof positive of a """"significant and massive"""" proposition [that fails every test of existence using science] As for [1] you seriously believe that whereas Nobel Laureates have not figured out and are in argument about Complexity Science, that """"you"""" have figured it out in relation to human interaction and action ! Do you see how laughable this is ? Seriously - you are an intelligent man, you do understand """"cognitive bias"""" , don't you ?

 What Makes a Person Notable? 

After deleting the listing of Hardy Parkerson from the listing of Longview's """"Notable People"""" and giving my reasons, the name was re-listed. To be fair, if Mr. Parkerson believes himself or if some one who knows him believes him to be a person who has notoriety because of his connection in Longview, I am willing to let the reader decide.  I do not dispute that Mr. Parkerson is notable for various reasons.  He is known for his poetic ditty's and short rhyming verses.  He is also known very well in Louisiana as an attorney where he practiced for some 40 years.  He has supporters and admirers who may well consider him """"famous"""" as well as detractors who consider him """"infamous"""".  He did not go quietly into the night when he resigned the Louisiana bar and retired from the practice of law.  

However, since Mr. Parkerson has lived and worked in Lake Charles, Louisiana since before he graduated from high school; and since he has not done anything significant or notable in his life that has been connected to his early years in Longview; and, since he is not recognized or known by any but a very few people in Longview, it is therefore fair to question his listing as a notable person from Longview.  Unlike others """"Notable People"""" listed in the Longview Texas article, very few references can be found regarding Mr. Parkerson's Longview roots.  (this contributor found only one on the Internet after extensive search). In fact, it is Lake Charles that is referenced as Mr. Parkerson's home. By comparison, in the other's listings their place of birth as Longview Texas is mentioned in almost every reference of their name. 

Mr. Parkerson was born in Longview.  He lived in White Oak (not Longview) until he was 12, (according to records found on the internet).  He moved to Nacogdoches, Texas and at some time moved again to Lake Charles, Louisiana where he graduated from high school.  Since then there is little if any record of his interaction with """"his home town.""""  As I said before, he needs to be satisfied to be a notable person from Lake Charles and Louisiana.

Therefore, if he is to be listed, and because he is not well known, some background needs to be given so that the reader will have a better understanding of Mr. Parkerson's connection to Longview. A short bio and the circumstances which led to his resignation and all should be made available to those who read his name in the list.  Otherwise he should be satisfied with his legacy in Louisiana, for he has none of note here.   """,0

Dear EdJohnston,

 Please find UST Global leadership team in the link http://www.ust-global.com/leadership.aspx
Do you really want to have external links that have outdated/wrong info about an article in Wikipedia? Wiki is an Encyclopedia which is most popular in the world and widely used for collecting accurate information about anything under the sun. Anyway Business Week has updated the content to the actual facts about the leadership team of UST Global. FYI the link to the same http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931. I think now you might have understood why I was removing this link before, when it was carrying outdated information.

This link takes you to the earliest revision history page of UST Global. Please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user Steve Ross started editing the page. This wikipedia page was started in 2005 and Steve came in to picture by 2007. The most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by Steve Ross. He added himself as co-founder of UST where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company. Don’t you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef? Also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this Wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of UST Global?

All you want to know about UST Global is available in their website (www.ust-global.com).

"slow the VFDTOAFD bot down? 

Hello,

Would it be possible to slow the VFDTOAFD bot down?  It's not overwhelming the bandwidth or resources of Wikipedia, but it is overwhelming the ability of human eyes to monitor the pagemove log (more than 5000 edits today alone).  Once any currently-being-voted-on VfD's are converted to AfD (I think that happened already quite some time ago), the old archived ones can be converted at much more leisurely pace, no?  Perhaps a few hundred a day?  Hardly anyone ever really looks at old archived VfD's, so there's no screaming urgency.  My worry is specifically that vandals may sneak in some pagemove vandalism in there that no one will catch, in the midst of thousands and thousands of other pagemoves, or a vanity userspace page will get moved to article space and no one will catch it (last time I checked, such a pagemove didn't show up in the Newpages log).

 A message from the UN regarding this """"UN"""" geoscheme 

Dear Bart

Thank you for your email.

The geographical groupings used by the United Nations Statistics Division follow the M49 Standard for Area Codes for Statistical use, details of which can be found here: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm

The designations employed and the presentation of material at this site do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories by the United Nations.

""""Regions"""" are so drawn as to obtain greater homogeneity in sizes of population, demographic circumstances and accuracy of demographic statistics (another example is Russia  it is in the continent of Asia but it belongs in the Eastern Europe """"region"""").  This nomenclature is widely used in international statistics but it is by no means universal.

I hope this is useful.

Best regards,

The UN Demographic Yearbook Team. It seems the geoscheme, that was created for internal use of one UN  agency is being not only over-quoted on Wikipedia, but also abused.

 Allegations of anti-semitism 
I propose that the anti-semitism allegations be subsumed into a section on Diversity in order to conform with WP:UNDUE. The section should talk about the school demographic profile. It is ridiculous to libel the school on the grounds of two faculty members. We don't even know if they weren't fired for incompetence. In fact, it seems we don't even presently have reliable sources that there were only two Israeli faculty members and when they were employed. Were these Israelis also Jewish? Does the newspaper article discuss this? (t, c) 

 has raised concerns about the reputability of the supporting article's editor, Gill Fraser. This is a good place to discuss this. Please come forward with your sources in support or opposition of this allegation. Same goes for the writer, Dan Fraser. (t, c) 

Given that the only source for the allegations right now is a forum content, I don't think there are any reliable sources supporting the allegation. In the absence of sources, the section should be removed. —' (talk) 

Agree forums of this nature are not reliable sources, and content lacking a reliable source should be removed.   

Adoniscik I am the right source to provide this information because I am talking from experience.  I had first written an angry letter to Cyprus Today in order to complain about some of our professors resigning due to the economic problems in 2005. It was published along with two responses which completely overwhelmed me with such claims that TRNC diplomas are 'worthless pieces of paper' and one other going so far as to say that EMU is a 'zoo'. I then wrote a second letter to defend the university because I felt my intentions were taken advantage of. I wanted to complain not trash the university. The following summer I had some work expierence which was not too bad but I still felt a bit uncomfortable about this newspapers stand to North Cyprus higher education. I did an interview with the Rector at the time Prof. Dr. Halil Guven which was not published. The next summer I translated positive artices from the Press office at EMU for 2-3 months and again they were not published. To be honest I have not been following what they have been writing since then, but as soon as I read that this article was written at Cyprus Today I am now certain that this newspaper has a negative stand point on TRNC higher education therefore, I do not think they are a reliable source on these matters. They cannot present the story in an objective manner.
As for the Israeli employees at EMU I can only provide again from first ahnd experience as one of his students that it was not anything to do with his nationality but honestly I don't think we were getting anything out of his classes. He just was not doing his job and at times making strange comments in his classes that were irritating students to the point that they would complain and sign a petition.   —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

As a party to the conflict, that is a sign that you are not the right source to provide information from the article. First-hand accounts are not appropriate for Wikipedia. —' (talk) 

C.Fred I will only accept that and not edit the aricle again if this issue is properly researched with the concerned parties in the conflict all present their story icluding myself. An objective party should listen to all sides of the story and then write an article which I will respect and it can then be submitted as wikipedia information. However, I do want to mention that I have read many university profiles on wikipedia and none provide this kind of information about conflicts they have within the university. A bit strange that someone wants it to be submitted here as well. EMU must have many enemies.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

 2012 THE END OF HUMAN HISTORY 

On this day 12/21/2012 will be a momentus day in the history of our planet and our civilization.  We will finally learn that humans are not alone in this universe and it will be discovered in a tremendous fasion.  We will learn that this universe is much more than anyone ever imagined, we will shed the """"god"""" myths of this world and know for the first time that humans are one of many species in this universe, not just our galaxy but the whole of the universe.  

The hate and war and injustices created by """"mans"""" religion will be over, the discovery will transport humans to another level never before imagined, technology will advance far beyond what we believed capable.  This will be a time of fear for many, losing ones """"god"""" and finding out that it was all man made will create those that refuse to move forward and experience the true meaning of our existance.  Many will try to impede our elevation to join the community of the universe and will try to attempt to demonize the truth and stop all of us from the truth.  

Many of humanity will choose to leave this world behind and travel to the stars in search of science, truth, logic and reason leaving those to their fate on planet Earth.""",0

The question of head winds. Both the last forecast sent to Earhart and Noonan and their reported conditions agree. It is most likely that they were encountering headwinds as high as 23 knots. It is also certain from her reports that they had climbed considerably above the optimum altitudes early in the flight and thus had to have had considerable additional fuel consumption. I would  refer you to Kelly Johnson's instructions prepared for Earhart on the flight profile necessary to achieve optimum range. Given the variables which we cannot know, I would imagine that she had 1-2 hours reserve by the time she reached the vicinity of Howland - but that might be optimistic. I cannot know how much fuel she had. One radio log indicates she stated 1/2 hour (but did that include the remainder of 100 octane?). One thing for certain is that she did state she was """"low on fuel"""" and that cannot be reasonably interpreted as meaning she was """"fat."""" This is OPINION, but given the anxiety she seemed to have in her voice and her use of the term 'low on fuel,"""" coupled with the forecast and reported (by her) winds, it is probable that they were far less than the optimum 4-5 hours given still air and best altitude operations would have made possible.

Mr. Gillespie can dismiss her report of ground speed and winds aloft as well as the far higher than optimum altitude she reported less than half way into the flight with the term """"speculation"""" (in a foot note). No one did at the time, nor can I. (OPINION- but) Though this is my Opinion, I CAN document several aspects of it including  the airplane designers instructions and how his instructions for an optimum profile differed from her report. Her reports and how they coincided with the last forecast the USN sent her from Hawaii. And thus how if Kelly Johnson was right, True had not incompetently read the information about winds aloft from reporting stations near her path, and she was not lying; then she MUST have had significantly higher fuel consumption than the optimum profile would have produced. How much, that is a question I cannot specifically answer. But for all three to be totally wrong, for there have been still air, for True to have been incompetent in his interpretation of winds aloft reports, and Earhart to have been lying about the """"winds"""" she reported and her """"speed"""" takes a bit of """"speculation"""" I cannot indulge in. Mistakes were made, but I can't imagine everyone made exactly the right combination of mistakes and deceptions to allow the Electra to have achieved it's optimum performance on the flight. Given the time which they apparently (from reports and signal strength) spent searching  for Howland Island, it is unlikely that they had a big reserve when the last signal was heard (OPINION). """,0

"On balance, the analysis of the path of Katrina shows that, in the final few hours, the hurricane veered away from downtown New Orleans, heading actually slightly northeast toward Mississippi where most people had evacuated or had trees to climb.  The storm tide in Mississippi was typically 20-32 feet (10-m) high after 4 hours, gutting 3rd-floor rooms, while in New Orleans, the tide was less than 7 feet (2 m) from being on the weak (west) side of the eye-path.  The levee system, raised to 23-feet high, would have been swamped 8 feet under by the Mississippi tide that flooded 12 miles inland.

Also, just before landfall, Katrina's eyewall replacement cycle miraculously reduced wind-speed from a Hurricane-Camille force down to only 125 mph (200 km/h), which might have shattered most windows in the French Quarter, but the wind subsided.  The 50,000 left in New Orleans could have faced a gushing sea of broken glass, but instead, saw slowly rising water for days, and had time to leave or wait for evacuation help from FEMA.

Although Katrina's reduced winds might seem like a made-for-NOLA miracle, many hurricanes have undergone a similar eyewall replacement cycle as winds slow suddenly when a hurricane approaches a wide land mass.",0

"Smalley's postion on these matters is essentially the same in his most recent work - he is still writing on the subject.  Moreover, Smalley's perception is also that of many other leading authorities on the Gospels in the early church; such as [[Christopher Rowland (theologian)|Christopher Rowland), who may not (unlike Smalley), be specialists in the Johannine literature.  The pespectives reperesented in the article as it is currently, represent (to my reading) one particular strand of the 'redaction critical' approach.  Broadly, this approach shares with Smalley/Rowland, a decreased tendency to regard the Synoptic Gospels as transmitting a 'historical' source.  But the corollary is to treat both the gospel genre; and much of the charactersistic gospel content; as a theological construct - specifically due to the author of Mark.  But if Mark 'invented' the feeding in the wilderness as a theological construct, then the presence of the same story in John shows dependence.  But this view of Mark is not by any means a consensus; many scholars (like Smalley and Rowland) would maintain that there were indeed independent 'historical' accounts of Jesus's ministry and gospel message that preceded both the Synpoptics and John, and provided the basis for their common narrative material.

 Urartu case 

First of all, I would like to complain about spying and stalking on all my activities from users like Nareklm. The latter recently interfered in page """"Request of Assistance"""" and removed a reference to personal attack which I reported to PAIN. I realize that my link is not valid anymore since it was archived. But case was reported - I have been insulted by Eupator.

Now - about Urartu.

First - I made my references. Those users  have been removed references. Wikipedia has a quite strong guidance about that. Further - about relevancy of my text, actually not only mine - there is other users who supported me)

I argue that section of """"Ethnic Composition"""" in page Urartu and page """"Antiquity"""" in page Armenia in its current version imply ethnic continuity and strong bonds between people who lived in Urartu (Academicians for example use term 'people of Urartu') and Armenians, who (sources I quoted say) moved in Urartu in 7-6 BC. My argument is not only about language diferrences. It is about ethnic and cultural ones. My arguments are on 'Request of Assistance' page. 

I'd like to quote professional historian about Urartu-Armenia nexus:

Philip L. Kohl, Clare Fawcett. Nationalism, Politics and the Practice of Archaeology (New Directions in Archaeology). Page 157: """"No less problematic are heavily slanted interpretations of the Urartian kingdom, the first historically attested state in Transcaucasia (ninth to seventh centuries BC). Armenian chauvinists must explain why this state, a worthy adversary of the neo-Assyrian Empire of northern Mesopotamia and one that expanded over much of """"historic Armenia,"""" composed its royal cuneiform inscriptions in Urartian, a non Indo-European ( i.e., non-Armenian) language, related to Hurrian and ancestral to the Northeastern Caucasian family of languages spoken today by different peoples in Daghestan, Chechenia, and Ingushetia (see Jankowska 1991:231). Reasonable historical hypotheses can be advanced for a Proto-Armenian component to this kingdom, and there is a real sense in which the Armenians are the cultural heirs of Urartu, but an essentialist view of Armenian culture which equates it precisely with the Urartian kingdom cannot be sustained. One must distinguish between popular and professional Armenian interpretations of Urartu, the latter being subtler and more difficult to evaluate. Thus, popular reference to the """"Piotrovskii problem"""" is based on the fact that B.B. Piotrovskii, the late Director of the Hermitage in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and former head of the excavations at Karmir Blur (the ancient Urartian capital of Teishebaine now located within the city of Yerevan), had quite reasonably maintained that the mighty Urartian Iron Age kingdom did not constitute the first Armenian state for the reasons stated above; the """"problem"""" only existed for those who wanted Armenians always to have lived in and controlled """"historic Armenia"""" until the later ravages wrought by Romans, Persians, Arabs, and Turks. More discriminating professional archaeologists, who may accept the reasonable theory that the ethnogenesis or formation of Armenian culture occurred during post-Urartian Achaemenid times, extol the might of the Urartians and see them exercising political control over most of eastern Anatolia, western Iran, and Transcaucasia; in this respect they remain the direct precursors of the Armenian kingdom under Tigran II.""""  

Finally, the problem is not only in the content of dispute itself. It is also about behavior of users - their insults, reluctuance to accomodate various views. """,0

The RMS Titanic was an Olympic-class passenger liner owned by British shipping company White Star Line and built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, United Kingdom. For her time, she was the largest passenger steamship in the world.

On the night of 14 April 1912, during the ship's maiden voyage, Titanic hit an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later, early on 15 April 1912. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. The high casualty rate was due in part to the fact that, although complying with the regulations of the time, the ship did not carry enough lifeboats for everyone aboard. The ship had a total lifeboat capacity of 1,178 people, although her capacity was 3,547. A disproportionate number of men died due to the women-and-children-first protocol that was followed.

The Titanic used some of the most advanced technology available at the time and was popularly believed to have been described as """"unsinkable.""""[6] It was a great shock to many that, despite the extensive safety features and experienced crew, the Titanic sank. The frenzy on the part of the media about Titanic's famous victims, the legends about the sinking, the resulting changes to maritime law, and the discovery of the wreck have contributed to the continuing interest in, and notoriety of, the Titanic.

 Social media 
The Hoax Slayer site has one page that is FB related. Recently, I saw the old email hoax of the two-striped jumper (spider) make the rounds on Zuck's baby. Now, whoever originated this thing did the disinformation. Unsuspecting folks forwarded misinformation. Again, the one who started the FB chain was doing disinformation (albeit more mischief than not, perhaps). But, I saw many reasonable folks take it at face value. There may be several reasons for this: trust of the sender, spider phobia, not taking the time to check out the message before forwarding (Share or Comment in the FB milieu). It was nice to find the Wikipedia page's section on the Hoax. Ought we have a category for hoaxes (motivated by continuing examples which necessitate discussion of this topic)? My little example is probably one of many that were active today where some of these might have been downright malevolent. BTW, this is the status of the page when I last edited (2007).

[edit] BiographyCuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania[6][7] and grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon, in a Jewish[8] working-class family. His last name was shortened from """"Chabenisky"""" when his Russian grandparents landed on Ellis Island.[9] Cuban's father Norton was an automobile upholsterer.[6][10][11] Cuban's first step into the business world occurred at age 12, when he sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive basketball shoes.[6][12] While in school, he held a variety of jobs, including bartender, disco dancing instructor, and party promoter. He paid for college by collecting and selling stamps, and once gained about $1,100 from starting a chain letter.[6]

Rather than attending high school for his senior year, Cuban enrolled as a full time student at the University of Pittsburgh. After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.[13]

[edit] FamilyIn September 2002, Cuban married Tiffany Stewart, an advertising executive, in Barbados,[14] with a wedding reception at the American Airlines Center. Their first daughter, Alexis Sofia, was born on September 25, 2005; their second daughter, Alyssa, was born in 2007.[15] Tiffany and Mark also have a son born in early 2010.[2] The family lives in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas, in a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) mansion.[16]

[edit] Early careerIn 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas. Cuban first found work as a bartender,[17][18] then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the first PC software retailers in Dallas. He was terminated less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.[19]

Cuban started a company, MicroSolutions, with support from his previous customers from Your Business Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe.[20] One of the company's largest clients was Perot Systems.[21] In 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of H&R; Block—for $6 million.[22] He retained approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal.[23]

In 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner started Audionet, combining their mutual interest in college basketball and webcasting. With a single server and an ISDN line,[24] Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter.[25] In 1999, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.9 billion in Yahoo! stock.[26]

[edit] Business careerAfter the sale of Broadcast.com, Cuban diversified his wealth to avoid exposure to a market crash.[27] As of 2011, Cuban is No. 459 on Forbes' list of """"World's Richest People"""", with a net worth of $2.5 billion.[28] The Guinness Book of Records credits Cuban with the """"largest single e-commerce transaction"""", after he paid $40",0

Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",1

 Hunting for embedded outlines 

While you are reading or browsing Wikipedia articles, please...

...keep a lookout for outlines embedded in articles.

I've run across a number of these over the years.  One example is the Outline of fencing, which used to be part of the fencing article.

If you know about or spot any structured general topics lists in articles, please let me know (on my talk page).

Another thing you might find are articles that are comprised mostly of lists (without """"Outline of"""" or """"List of"""" being in the article's title).  If you come across any of these, please report them to me on my talk page.  I'd sure like to take a look at them.

Happy hunting.

My concern is that an entire article on Billy the Kid was removed for no valid reason. That article not only contained my contributions, but the contributions of others. It contained the most detailed bibliography on Billy the Kid offered yet on Wikepedia. It also included 147 detailed citations. There is no valid excuse for removing that article and substituting the mess that is there now. Blocking me for real or imagined infractions is one thing. Destroying the article that I, and others, had worked long and hard on - and replacing it with an absolute piece of junk - is quite another. You have done extensive work on Wikipedia's Wyatt Earp article. How would you feel if all of your efforts were deleted? What was done to my last version of the Billy Kid article is nothing less than criminal - and that crime is against Wikipedia and all of those unselfish people who have tried to make it a reliable source. The joke is, I considered myself finished with the Billy the Kid article when it was suddenly removed. Now if you, and the others at Wikipedia """"sincerely value your expertise. Wikipedia needs knowledgeable authors like you,"""" as you say. You will restore my last version of the article. Here is my good faith offer: If Wikipedia will restore that article at the point where I last left it, I promise that I will not go near it again. I look forward to the work that your expert editors can do to correct the """"encyclopedic tone,"""" and encourage that effort. I also look forward to submissions and improvements to this article by other Wikipedians. Please note that I have claimed to """"own"""" the Billy the Kid article. All I was trying to do was to provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from. The quickest way to do this is restore the article as it was when it was moved. I have no intention of trying to get it back to that point, by correcting the absolute mess that is up there right now. I trust you and all the forthright editors at Wikipedia to correct the """"encyclopedic tone"""" that you consider lacking. I would also appreciate the removal of those tags that have suddenly appeared at the top of articles I contributed to on Bat Masterson and Luke Short. They suddenly appeared on the Masterson and Short articles at the exact same time my last version of Billy the Kid. It is not that I should be treated differently because of my credentials in the Wild West History field ... the fact is that no one should have to be treated that way. This is childish behavior from those who don't have the best interest of Wikipedia involved. I won't bother asking to be unblocked ( which, of course, I should be ) since I have to leave the clowns that put that block in place something they can brag about ... as in the vein of """"Well, I guess we showed him!"""" Now the time has come to show everyone else what Wikipedia really stands for. The place to start is with your good faith restoration of my Billy the Kid article exactly as it was when I last worked on it. Unless I am specifically asked for clarification, on some historical point on the Kid,by you, and others involved with Wikipedia, I have absolutely no intention of doing anything further on the subject of Billy the Kid. My best wishes to you and all of those who labor so hard at making Wikipedia great. Happy holidays to you all ... you already know what I want for Christmas as far as Wikipedia is concerned.   """,0

Observation of Barack's bio or The Wiki-Obama standards of political content and style

I find it curious the Biography of Barack Obama has not one negative element to it.  It reads like a campaign mailer, with glowing remarks and fawning reverence for Mr. Obama.  In observing this article, and comparing in to, McCain's, Sarah Palin's (see typical example here   and other Republican office holders biography, the Republican ones are filled, with all sorts of negativity, red herring,  and plain old guilt by association.  Now if considering the precedents and standards, as they were up held on this article and vigorously defended by those with like """"Scjessey"""" and """"Wikidemon"""" and others I will conclude these are considered to be typical and reflect the consensus of those on Wikipedia.  As such I will take it a step further and  apply these precedents of style and content or what I would like to coin the """"Wiki-Obama standards of political content and style"""" on Republican office holders biographies, with equal and fair vigor as it has been applied here on the Obama's Biography.
This must be done, in order to bring true fairness and non-partisanship, as well good balance and neutrality to the Political biographies on Wikipedia.

Please note that we are asking you to estimate only the negative effects of the students' work.  If the students added good material but you spent time formatting it or making it conform to the manual of style, or copyediting it, then the material added was still a net benefit, and the work you did improved it further.

""":::""""#The one where you add """"and sometimes unfortunately"""". You drift into pure editorializing; this needs some other formulation that isn't a pure projection of your opinion and/or personal experiences. I happen to be a champion within the Waldorf movement of revising the emphasis on the eight-year class teacher period. But the opposite of """"brochure speak"""" is """"antagonist speak""""; both may make statements that appear clear, objective and meaningful to the person making them - but are too broad and too vague simultaneously. It is """"weasel"""" language; unattributed, both unprovable and undisprovable. """"  The percentage of teachers who make it through 8 years with a single class is staggeringly LOW - so what starts as a lofty goal often ends up as an interruption of the children's education - and often under difficult circumstances.  Making the claim that a teacher stays with the class for 8 years is brochure speech not supported by reality.  It's like saying - """"it is the intention of each baseball player to bat 1000"""".  It is meaningless except for the purpose of sucking people into a set of ideals that aren't part of reality.  If you don't like the statement that points out the reality of the situation, then we should remove the claim completely.

""""#The wholesale removal of the section on rhythm in the kindergarten. It needed revision, but not removal. I would replace it with something like: """"Waldorf early-childhood pedagogy believes that clear daily and weekly rhythms are essential for the child's healthy development and emotional security. [citation] [reference to the elements of this rhythm] It also believes that both the seasons and festivals relating to the course of the year provide central formative experiences.[citation]"""" This is a huge part of Waldorf's approach to early-childhood education and needs mention.""""  I don't disagree that this is part of the pedagogy, but the wording has to be concise.  """"Essential for the child's healthy development and emotional security"""" - you sound like Donald Rumsfeld with your terrorist scare tactics here.  Yes, let's all just scare the parents into Waldorf education.  How about just saying """"rhythms during the day and through the year are thought to be important""""?  What you wrote above is the type of brochure speech that riddles this article and makes it impossible to view it as other than a advertisement.

""""Others of your edits I have already revised and a middle ground has been found; this process will continue, I would expect. I have not been reverting your edits generally; only blatant editorializing (which I have sometimes managed to convert into something meaningful)."""" Your """"middle ground"""" and mine are in very different places, my friend.  Blatant editorializing is what my edits have been removing.  Just because I haven't had time to go back and re-word what you believe you have made """"meaningful"""" doesn't mean it has any validity in this article.  As long as you, a Waldorf teacher, is here making this article """"meaningful"""" - there will be no end to the controversy here.

""""The tag should go because it is presently unjustified, as you all agree; it is inaccurate in its present form; why are you advocating keeping something that is not accurate? If it becomes accurate, it should go back; that's easy enough to do."""" Nobody agrees - as far as I know, with what you have said above - although one polemic editor besides yourself did remove the tag.  The tag is completely justified.  Here's the next paragraph that needs brochure speech removed: 

""""According to Steiner, the child at this early stage learns through imitation and example,[4] so in Waldorf it is considered best to surround him with the goodness of the world and caring, practically active adults to emulate. The curriculum attempts to awaken the child's will and initiative; the teacher has the responsibility for providing an environment that stimulates imitation. In Waldorf, such an environment is believed to support the physical and spiritual growth of the child. Formal learning is absent, and experiences of the written language are consciously avoided. Oral language development is addressed through circle games (songs, poems and games in movement), daily story time (normally recited from memory) and the range of practical activities.""""

And there are more and more similar paragraphs that require lots of work.  I'm sorry if it is offensive to you as a Waldorf teacher, to find out that lots and lots of people besides you feel it is best to surround children with goodness.  In fact, maybe you should point out schools who, as their goal, consider it best to surround children with something other than goodness.  There is absolutely no justification for removing the tag while this type of language fills the article.  There was, at one time, a promise of a re-write of the article (most of which, I belie",0

 Answer to Osli73 

Those with leftist agenda cannot be considered neutral observers due to their denial of genocide and open one-sidedness with Serbs and/or Milosevic, see Znet resource for example. When you mention """"Bosniak sources"""", who are you referring to? Do you consider the International Tribunal a """"Bosniak source""""? Srebrenica massacre is heavily based on Internationa Tribunal's rulling (e.g. Radislav Krstic judgement), and you are trying to destroy the article by inserting revisionist 'garbage' with the purpose of morally equivating victims with aggressors who committed genocide. The bottom line is: Alternative views do not matter, what matters is cold-harded facts from such sources as International Tribunal, Human Rights Watch, State-sponsored Research & Documentation Centre, International Missing Association (or whatever the official name is) etc. When it comes to editing this article in a """"rational matter"""", you are the only one who rejects International Tribunal's version of the article and seeks Serbian (or pro-Serbian) version of the article.

 Note to Administrator Regarding Above Move Request 

To the administrator who will review the above move request.  Note that the names used in these articles were chosen after many months of discussions, discussions that included a wide variety of editors.  The compromise solution was to use Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtirol, the Province of Trento, and the Province of Bolzano-Bozen.  This was a compromise that kept both the Italian and German usage in the names, and was also the usage in Encyclopedia Britannica (to name just one major English source).  There is slander going on above by Mai-Sachme when he says that individuals engineered this solution, or did it by some form of trickery.  He also went as far as to erase a similar warning to the reviewing administrator.  It is a little shocking, but maybe not surprising, that after a few years a certain editor tries to put things back to how he originally had placed them unilaterally.  Right here what we are seeing is nothing less than than a ambush of this page and I strongly suspect that he has contacted a lot of these editors thru e-mail to ask them to come and support this ambush.   It is no coincidence that within a couple of days all the German-speaking users who happened to be against the compromise solution show up to vote for this.  This is utter abuse of Wikipedia.  So, again, if Wikipedia is at all fair, this move request should be struck down.  It is FACT that in English both the names Alto Adige and South Tyrol, AND Province of Bolzano are in regular use.  Go to any grocery in the United States, and products from this region are advertised as """"wine from Alto Adige"""" or """"speck from Alto Adige"""".  Yet, the same editor who makes this move request (and others who are voting here) has constitently attempted to marginalize the name Alto Adige on this page, or remove its bold typeface next to South Tyrol, or even acknowledge that it is used commonly in English (just review the edits made on these pages over the past year).  What it truly shameful is that this cements the fact that there is no room in these particular people's minds for compromise and to a solution that allowed an Italian/German naming convention.  Wikipedia is NOT a democracy, and this ambush of the page to try to revert the page to a German-centric viewpoint by sending a dozen German-speaking voters here is just wrong.""",0

"This page needs a major re-write. Its contents are controversial, yet the discussion of the controversial aspects does not cite references. Some of the the sub topics fail to justify how they help explain the primary topic, instead they mention tangential controversy wihout satisfactorily connecting that controversy with the subject matter. For example, mention of the Reimer case does not contribute to the sub matter here. Another example would be failure to cite the actual Johns Hopkins articles, the evidence of their bias and lack of scientif rigor, or the various subsequent studies that refute the Johns Hopkins article, which is over 25 years old and out dated at best. Also few other topics on medical procedures spend so much time discussing external opinions about them made by religious extremists, who lack medication education. Those few might only be abortion and invitro fertilization.

 Re. #1: I'm not sure what you mean by """"different ground"""". They differ in their POV: While Notable assassinations of the Sri Lankan Civil War is written according to WP:NPOV, Assassinations and murders attributed to the LTTE is functionally a WP:POV fork. (I say """"functionally"""" because it historically preceded the other article, so it hasn't been created with that intention. However, I feel that the decision to keep a POV version in addition to an NPOV version amounts functionally to the same as creating a POV fork.) That is certainly not a reason to keep the latter.

 Re. #2 & #3: I assume you're talking about WP:SIZE. There is absolutely no reason to be worried about that:
 WP:SIZE is not a policy, but a guideline, so it the statement """"itis agaisnt wikipedia policy"""" is simply wrong.
 The guideline says: """"Readers may tire of reading a page much longer than about 6,000 to 10,000 words"""". The article body currently has 935 words, so we're not even close by any stretch of the imagination. 
 Even if we were close, the guideline specifically says: No need for haste.
 Even if we were beyond the recommandation, there are many other ways to split articles. Splitting it by POV is not the way to do it. 

 In conclusion, I am not convinced by any of the arguments; I don't see any benefit for Wikipedia if we kept the """"... LTTE"""" article. 

 Since this is not an official mediation, and since the three opposing editors have not applied for WP:SLR membership, I have no mandate or obligation to represent them. Nevertheless, I want to regard their needs. The fact that we see some unconvincing arguments could indicate that there are other, unexpressed, needs which the """"... LTTE"""" article satisfies. If that is the case, then there could be more at stake than just a harmless redirect. If that is the case, then I recommend bringing it up on WP:AFD. —  """,0

"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",0

In the long term, yes. However, at the moment my main concern is the complete lack, or sparsity of, information concering ship classes. I'd like to make sure there's no redlinks for any """"modern"""" ship classes, certainly not for anything major since World War 2. I'd also like there to make sure that what information is out there is presented in a straightforward, accurate and common style.

I do not see this as an ethnic struggle for self-determination of Ukranians and Russians from Moldovans.

Regarding the will of the people and dancing with joy in the streets, no impartial observer—and certainly no Russo-skeptic—will regard those as true expressions until such time as, minimally:
 the authorities, from the top to the bottom, are replaced with Transnistrian natives, not populated by Russian citizens including OMON thugs who transplanted to Transnistria once their attempts at thwarting true democracy in the Baltics by violent and deadly means failed, and
 Russia (and Ukranian) forces completely vacate the Transnistrian territory, that is all arms, all troops, and raze all arms depots to the ground.
When that happens, and people then dance in the streets, then I will be prepared to initiate a discussion with you about that expression being genuine.
   You keep talking about the parliament's """"opposition"""" to Smirnov. As a Russo-skeptic, I will tell you that my interpretation is not popular representation in action, my interpretation is a bunch of initially hastily organized parties which all suddenly appeared right before some """"elections"""" which are now engaged with the leadership—which has not changed since its inception—in a carefully orchestrated ballet intended to present a fully believable facsimile of representative government. We can seriously discuss the will of the people:
after every Russian in the PMR authorities is out (as in out, and out of the country);
after the foreign troops are all out (as in out of the country, and their arms depots demolished)and I don't mean Russian military retiring to become """"citizens of the PMR,"""" either;
after it is legal for a political party to be pro-Moldovan (that currently being treason); and
after Romanian is once again taught in its proper Latin script, not in some Cyrillic Soviet-era utter bastardization created purely to support the Stalinist fiction that Moldovans are not Romanians.

"Topics for Revising Gravity article 

What was challenging? 
For film's that propose questions about reality and controversy- an opportunity is deemed by users to not only post information about the film/actors/production, etc, but also to discuss themes present in the movie. Drifting away from that note, the article itself meets the standards to being a good article. There are little to none spelling errors, and information is almost spot-on with the right dates, people, and nomination facts. But that may be the overall problem of this article...is it too much factual based? Are people necessarily not focused on the article itself but rather the movie? In order to improve not only the article but the revisions to the essay, I will focus on how the film can compare to previous NASA space missions.
Possible Topics for Article Gravity (Film):

Imdb.com 

Factual Errors/ Scientific Accuracy
-Stars do not twinkle in the realms of space. If you are located on the earth’s surface, you might witness the twinkling of stars because of the earth’s atmosphere. 
-When Kowalski and Stone are stuck between cords in a spacecraft, Kowalski orders to be let go of and is then sent through space, floating away with decreasing oxygen levels. This is incorrect because both are in the same orbit, so a small tug would have worked to pull Kowalski toward safety. 
- When Dr. Stone gets back into the spacecraft, she initially takes off her spacesuit. Two parts are missing: Liquid Cooling & Ventilation Garment. In the film, Stone goes through an extreme amount of stress and excitement, leaving her to be awfully sweaty underneath her spacesuit. However, as she takes it off, there are no signs of sweat, which does not make sense.

My characterization of a person who first laughed at the posting of a hobbyist video but a day later decided he found he it to be THREATENING BEHAVIOR requiring disciplinary action is not an incivil personal attack but a perfectly accurate and justified assessment. And I believe I have the right to express my opinion of such behavior on MY OWN TALK PAGE. The behavior he exhibited was pure paranoia and hysterics as I see it, and others have agreed, and he also is accurately described as someone who continually deleted cited and relevant material from Wikipedia despite mine and others protests, as well as all comments made by him and myself that showed his own incivil behavior. That is why I have reproduced the exchange on my talk page as it has been deleted from where it originally occurred with only my YouTube post left intact. I wonder why he did that? My remark above contains nothing profane and represents my view of his outrageous behavior and was placed nowhere but on MY OWN TALK PAGE.

First, give the basic informationthe source should be the CV birthplace and date, degrees, previous positions. If there are published books, list them in formal bibliographic style. List the 3 or 4 most influential articles similarly, getting citation figures from Web of Science. Include major national level offices and awards, but not minor ones. Be sure to list editorships (but not mere editorial board membership) we consider it very important, and you should add it to the articles for the relevant journals also, with a link to the bio. 

If the person has any notable students who would qualify for Wikipedia bios, include them. Their PhD & postdoctoral advisors probably also qualify for bios here; add them and link them, even if they do not yet have articles. 

It is not necessary to cite the basic information in detail to other than the official CV. However, give any actual references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but not blogs or press releases, or material derived from press releases. For any part you quote directly from a published bio, include quotation marks and a reference.

The International Astronomical Union invented the designation """"dwarf planet"""" in 2006.

When Wikipedia uses the term """"dwarf planet"""", it means whatever the IAU means by """"dwarf planet"""", regardless of what any other person may use the term to mean. The statement that there are """"hundreds or thousands of dwarf planets"""" is not accurate; there may be hundreds of candidate objects, some of which might some day be accepted as dwarf planets, and there may be thousands of objects yet to be discovered which might be candidates for being labelled dwarf planets, but at this moment, there are only five objects which actually are dwarf planets. Because """"dwarf planet"""" is an arbitrary label, we cannot reasonably say that, say, Sedna or Quaoar are dwarf planets; they would only become dwarf planets at such future date as they may be named as such, which depends upon obtaining accurate data as to their size, mass, composition, and shape, which is not as yet available. To say definitively that there are dwarf planets other than the five that have been named goes far beyond what Wikipedia is entitled to do.

This is difficult, because I never learnt all the different names for the parts of English grammar when I was in school: only how to use them.  

Taking the commas first, strictly speaking you are possibly correct in that they could – or even should – be used in the places that you indicate.  However, stylistically it is very bad to split sentences up into very small bits unless absolutely necessary, and it is much better to have a flowing sentence than to implement punctuation that makes the prose harder to read.  

With the """"Churchill devoted his time to educating himself"""" sentence, another way of putting it is to say that he allocated all of his free time to educating himself: if you used 'educate' it would indicate a future goal, not an on-going condition—there wasn't a point at which his education would be complete.

"Where is the data for your claims on accidents?  It's hard to imagine that head-on crashes of stage coaches were common occurrences. Accidents in competitions involving horses are fairly common, but bad outcomes on simple trips to town from the herders' camp to town for grub would most likely have involved bandits and other such hazards. And another thing, at the time when horses were in common use for transportation, traffic density was much lower than at the present time.  Riding through a deserted Fairmont Park in Philadelphia, a rider on a horse going at a walking pace and a rider in a car doing the speed limit would both be quite safe. Riders galloping would at most risk falling off going at about 25 mph. Drivers speeding with an equal degree of recklessness might spin out on a curve at 75 mpg. Riders can wear helmets that protect against brain damage but not broken necks. Drivers can use seat belts, and racing drivers can use other protections, so it is a little difficult to know what is being compared to what.  Even so, the deadly injuries among non-competition horse accidents are almost all head injuries suffered by riders whose horses spook for some reason. (See Jessica Jahiel's website.) The commonest injuries would most likely be broken arms from riders who fall.  A car crash at even relatively low speeds can produce the same head injuries (which is why cars now have padded dash boards), and as speeds increase the probability of serious injuries to the head and trunk becomes much higher.

As for feces, true, horse manure is not too appealing to walk through with bare feet, and somebody needs to remove it from the road. On the other hand, it is not toxic the way lead is. Once removed from the road, it can be used to produce good compost.  Even if people just leave it on a country road, it soon packs down into a uniform brown soft and well-compacted mass. Leave a clump of horse manure on your front yard and it become fertilizer. Dump a cup of used engine oil on your yard and you have long-term contamination.",0

In particular, phrases like """"Kerry wants to grant rights to homosexuals"""" (which I removed altogether) I find to be somewhat sub-NPOV. The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition. I opted to just remove the most contentious phrase, which was redundant anyway, and to add qualifiers to another phrase to reflect the Jeffersonian POV w.r.t. inalienable rights.

Does any one moniter you Phil? First you add, then you delete, then you re-add the same information, then you delete each time citing a different reason.

Your latest removal of reference to Heart Beat Records as copyright owner stated the reason you removed it was because it was being contested in court. This was after you took it off and then came back and added it.

Regardless, the reason you cite for your actions THIS time is inaccurate. The copyright owner , Hearbeat Records, has sued another party for violating copyrights that they own. There are no suits against them or legal proceedings where someone has contested their ownership. Where do you get this from? Please cite your source as the only public information availabe is the law suit in which Heart Beat has sued another party for violating copyrights they own in as verified by the US Copyright office.

I simply do not understand how you come up with your reasoning to not cite Heart Beat as the official copyright holder of the CD's that are listed under the US Copyright Office?

 need update to 1st source, in lede: that src now says Multiregional took away RAO's formerly """"mainstream"""" status, in the book's 2012 edition.  Also: reasons to support a long ignored proposal to unlock the article. 

A new edition of The Essence of Anthropology (by McBride B, Haviland WE, Prins HEL, Walrath D) is available, dated 2012.  This article is still citing the 2009 edition of the same book.

Note that the new, 2012 edition says  on pg. 94:
""""Until 2010, the recent African origins hypothesis was the mainstream position. But when researchers from the Max Planck Institute released a study comparing the Neanderthal genome...the genetic evidence shifted to supporting the multiregional hypothesis.[19]""""

This article's statement of RAO being """"the most widely accepted model..."""" was relying on the outdated 2009 edition of this book having said, on pg. 90 of the 2009 edition, that RAO """"is"""" the """"mainstream"""" position; the sentence involving what is """"mainstream"""" was revised in the 2012 edition, to say that the evidence now """"supports"""" the multiregional hypothesis.

This article's first sentence should therefore read (edits are in italics): """"...dubbed the """"Out of Africa"""" theory, was the most widely accepted model describing the geographic origin and early migration of anatomically modern humans, until the Multiregional_origin_of_modern_humans gained favour.""""

-

Also, who has kept the article locked for years and what is their reason for why it is still locked? Are the sources for each of these competing hypotheses so dubious and disputed?

And did the pro-RAO vandal himself lock this article, and then quit WP, or has had his account suspended, or what?
Why else is there no response to complaints about this article being locked for such a long-term, but that the one who locked it has long ignored this article and cannot be trusted to lock articles (if he is even still a WP member)? Per the fact-based accusations that were raised in the above topics in this Talk page, it should be unlocked in order to add the discoveries (I'd say """"recent discoveries,"""" except that 2010 isn't recent, which again exhibits that nobody holding a WP account is responsible enough to be trusted with the locking of this article, especially not an anthropologist or even anthro student, because if this article had even one expert editor, he should recognise immediately that the above edit requests are from veracious sources and are the reasons for the requests are explained explicitly enough that anyone worth their salt should comprehend what's being requested).

Others posing this question about why this article is locked have been unanswered for roughly a year, so who locked this article, then ignored this badly neglected, scientifically outdated article, for so long? And ironically, the people who want it unlocked are desiring to update this article with recent facts, i.e. discoveries, that refute RAO, so obviously none of us are the pro-RAO vandal, but this article was locked for years (literally) even before that complaint of a list of edits by a pro-RAO vandal was raised on the Talk page, again raising my question: Did the pro-RAO vandal make his edits to corrupt the veracity of this article, and then skip town, so to speak? 209.97.203.60  """,0

 Fare Thee Weel, My Fine Friend! 

I'm back in town for a day and thought I'd drop by again.  I took a look at how your RFAr was coming along, as well as your evidence you are marshalling in your """"Sandbox"""" at [].  I must say I am rather disappointed at the slight nature of said evidence.  Not that I'm going to be around, but I'm sure you don't have a very strong hand, as it were.  As I've said before, I've already explained the alternate accounts, and users Casito (and Soltak also to a smaller extent) have been just as uncivil to me as I had been to them.  Casito basically accused me of being a pedophile/stalker of some kind in his statement to the Arbitration Committee after all.

One thing that did seriously concern me and that I'd like to, if you please, elucidate, is that Casito's statement about """"website defacement"""" being a """"crime"""" in """"many jurisdictions"""" is absolutely 100% misleading in our context.  First, there are no local jurisdictional issues here, the Internet is regulated at the national level in the U.S.  (I'm sure you knew that).  Second, like I told Casito, this is a Wiki, any changes on here, no matter how malicious, do not rise to the level of """"defacement,"""" which pertains more to secure/static websites (think US Govt homepages for instance).  I don't know whether he realised this, but in practical terms what Casito said was misleading on both legal and practical grounds, a bluff if you will.  Of course he didn't realise that I could see through his bluff, and when I calmly explained these two above points to him, he got really defensive and quite """"pissy,"""" just as I'm sure he would in real life.  Just between you and me, he just doesn't seem like a really """"cool kid.""""

For you, however, I have the utmost respect, being a liberal arts Professor in the only civilised part of the U.S. as far as I'm concerned.  However, you might want to hurry up presenting your evidence, since I'm once again leaving the country at 8:55 am tommorrow and won't be back until next month; and as I said on my user page, I won't be editing on Wikipedia any more after I get back to work and my routine, etc.

"""

Well if you want to sincerely discuss it I can make an exception as I have the expertise and have some time so I ask you first to consider the full context of the selections you outline. The Aurobindo letter begins: """"All these experiences are of the same nature and what applies to one applies to another. Apart from some experiences of a personal character, the rest are either idea-truths, such as pour down into the consciousness from above when one gets into touch with certain planes of being, or strong formations from the larger mental and vital worlds which, when one is directly open to these worlds, rush in and want to use the sadhak for their fulfilment. These things, when they pour down or come in, present themselves with a great force, a vivid sense of inspiration or illumination, much sensation of light and joy, an impression of widening and power. The sadhak feels himself freed from the normal limits, projected into a wonderful new world of experience, filled and enlarged and exalted; what comes associates itself, besides, with his aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi; it is represented even as itself that realisation and fulfillment."""" In short they are talking about planes of consciousness (basically astral and mental planes) which more experienced occultists are familiar with as actual realms. Ancient occult lore is true that there are stages of awakening to these planes which is what is meant but the danger is in not being able to handle the energies and conscious influences, archetypal forms and beings there so that one becomes more of an intermediate zone medium (a sad state some of us have actually observed which is why Kazlev popularized the concept). This becomes clearer once you read the full text of Paul Brunton's Chapter on the Intermediate Zone here: http://paulbrunton.org/notebooks/16/12. 

Brunton's beginning point is that: """"The pathway of the mystical goal is strewn with human wreckage. Why? Several reasons would be needed to give a complete answer but one of the most important is this: Between the state of ordinary man and the state of the matured mystic there lies a perilous and deceptive psychological region which has been given various names in mystical literature. It has been called the astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion, and so on. The early efforts of all aspirants in concentration, meditation, self-conquest, and study, bring them into this region. But once here their egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, their emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, their imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. The consequence of failure to negotiate these changes properly is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and imagination gone wild. The safeguards against all this are first, submission to the philosophic discipline and second, submission to competent guidance."""" 

I appreciate that you have more of a Buddhist orientation in your views while the sources use Hindu based concepts. In this case to say that the IZ is similar to a Buddhist concept of a spiritual bypass which is """"a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks"""" is sufficiently related to the IZ concepts of Aurobindo and Brunton to justify combining rather than cross referencing them, is to miss the import of the IZ concept. You would be familiar with the Buddhist wheel of life with its different realms of being. A more Buddhist way to look at it would be that you have to pass the tests of illusion and influences of certain beings of each realm up to and including Mara to truly get through the IZ (and free of the wheel), and it is too dangerous without a proper guide. While Buddha (or for that matter any enlightened being) is fully awake and present on every level of the wheel) the aspirant is only awakening slowly from the dream and can be easily confused. Even highly practiced, relatively balanced and well meaning spiritual people can and do fail to pass through the IZ. The """"spiritual bypass"""" is a concept far too psychological to express the broader meaning of the IZ. 

So I think your idea has some merit and certainly the article can and should be improved but a better solution would be to improved the cross referencing and not just force an integration of the terms. I hope you take the time to thoroughly review Aurobindo and Brunton's full exposition of the concept before pushing ahead. I have no difficulty with you taking over lead on the article in that case. All I ask is that editors be thorough and give some weight to those with expertise on a specific topic.   """,0

   There is nothing irrelevent about the argument about the crediblity of the investigation, prosecution, or outcome of this case; in face, that argument about the credibility is itself a major part of this story.

HI. I've appreciated your responses on this topic, but these   have been difficult for me to understand. I'm thinking that perhaps my confusion stems from argument(s) I've heard that """"physics is local"""" which might mean limiting inertial reference frames to specific and very localized lattices?

Another possible source of confusion (I don't know if this is the case, but as I said I'm at a lost to understand your reply) is perhaps you are thinking Hubble's law isn't uniform when AFAIK is supposed to involve a spatially uniform expansion (observers in different parts of the observable universe should be currently observing basically the same distant red shifts and law).

Hello James Cantor,

Thank you so much for your comments. The last 21 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine have had wiki pages for a number of years and the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate. I just find is unusual that Crusio's page is so much larger than those who are far more notable. I think Crusio's page size should be about the size of an average Nobel Laureate. I can not but wonder how Wim Crusio's page is so much bigger than that last 21 of the most recent Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine. As a scientist, one tends to plot data on a graph, and if you where to do so, Crusio's data point would be considered an out lier. As I stated, the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate over many years. These pages have been edited by hundreds of users for many years, I think that gives us good yard stick, and says something about how much information a scientists site should have.

Are there invisible words I have not been able to read?  1-She has Portuguese ancestry because her parents are Portuguese.

The article states that """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""", but this is not true. They are exlusive acording to the constitution of Montenegro, the constitutional charter of Serbia and Montenegro, and half a dozen separate censuses since the mid 20th century - all of which allow only one national identity to be declared. These are the raw and unbiased facts (not speculation). On the other hand, it is true that a number of Serbs and Montenegrins may believe that they have both identities - but there is no modern census nor constitutional basis that can support a statement such as """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""". Many Montenegrins do not feel to be Serb, and never pronounce themselves as such. You can not force national groups to """"be Serb"""" if they do not feel so and never declare as such.

""""However the number of Montenegrins does seem to be in steep decline since the introduction of the category by the Communists on the 1948 census"""" seems to imply that the Communist regime declared the nationality of citizens in polls. This is not true, as citizens declared their nationaility in polls, individually. In fact, the Communists - for the first time allowed citizens to declare their nationality as Montenegrin - by introducing the category, which is more important. If it stands like the previous user wants it to stand, then we must add a sentence stipulating that the """"Serbian ruling dynasties in the pre World War II Yugoslavia banned Montenegrin citizens from declaring their nationality as 'Montenegrin'"""" This is as true as the Communist quirp, as the Montenegrin option was obviously not allowed before World War II.

The article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920. 
The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. 

The statement """"over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""" is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that """"most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""", but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.

You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that """"all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918."""" This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in """"its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church"""" it is not balanced. Also, the statement """"its following is small to the point of non-existence"""" needs to be based on fact not fancy. Do you have an official census of followers, or is this based on the fact that you are a believer of the SOC?

The sentence """"The validity of the referendum was not confirmed by international observers as the allegedly free and democratic vote, in fact took place during wartime in the former Yugoslavia."""" is true. So I leave it. Of course, I agree to change """"international"""" into """"OSCE, EU and US"""" - as the referendum may have had international monitoring from Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Byelorussia, and Russia.

or by creation of separate articles for Khatris from different states . Although the overwhelming majority of Khatris are Punjabi , this article in its current state has juxtaposed  citations and content from books pertaining  to one region to attach to another , which is really quite absurd .

 For Richard 20Feb07
Unfortunately Haar 2005 – reviewed the book this is not about explsion 1944-1948(1950) it is about ethnic cleanings before 1945 done by Germans and scientists who supported this ideas.
Overmans book 2000, “Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg.” Is strictly about German military losses nothing more – nothing there about expulsion?

I confess that I don't know what Nitschke has to say on this subject.

She says: “Of around 12.4 million Germans within the lands of post-war Poland in 1944, six million fled or were evacuated, 3.6 million were expelled, one million were verified as Poles, 300,000 remained in Poland as a German minority, and up to 1.1 million died (p. 280).”
Thus that means TOTAL: 1.1 millions deaths.

She also says: “Though estimates of the dead range widely, as many as ‘’’a million Germans’’’ perished during flight and expulsion from Poland in 1944-45.”

It means in years 1946 - 1950? 100.000. Take for consideration that so call wild expulsion started on May 1945 and the 1944 and first part of 1945 was actually the flight.

Next she says: “In the long fourth chapter, Nitschke turns to the expulsions, which came in three waves. During a period of """"wild expulsions"""" from May to July 1945, the Polish military drove up to 400,000 Germans across Poland's new western border.”

“The second wave of expulsions came after the Potsdam conference, but before the """"organized transfer"""" of remaining Germans began in early 1946. From August to December, 1945, Poles expelled close to 600,000 more Germans in poorly organized transports.”

“The final phase involved the transfer of 2.25 million Germans in a process coordinated with British and Soviet authorities in occupied Germany in 1946 and 1947.” """,0

"""

 This is an interesting discussion with good points made by all. I can add a little bit that might be helpful. As mentioned by the editors above the dictionay definition and a legal definition are not the same and one state's legal definition might be different from another's. So why not say this in the article. What definition a reader needs or wants depends on their purpose. For example, if a young person is reading a book meant for older persons and comes across the word adultery, his needs will be far different than those of a lawyer who's client walks in and says, """"They charged me with 'adultery'; what's that?"""" In the first case the reader might need nothing more than a dictionary definition (or perhaps a little more, particularly that it is rare for someone to go to jail for it), and in the second case, the lawyer will want to explain all the elements of the crime (each thing that must be proved by the government in order to find someone guilty, including that it was done knowingly, etc.).

 The beginning could say: """"Adultery, in some jurisdictions a crime or a tort (a civil wrong) is generally defined as (insert dictionary definition). However in the legal context of a person actually being charged with adultery as a crime or cited as a grounds for a divorce or other lawsuit, a more precise definition would be required.

 The term adultery usually refers to the rarely prosecuted common law or statutory crime relating to having extra-marital relations, but usually in an informal or literary context not in a legal context.

 In ordinary usage the vagueness of the term is not a hindrance to communication, as the scope of the term is understood to change from context to context, some requiring more specifics than others. In a legal sense, residents of the United States, for example, understand that such laws differ from state to state, and even from time to time as laws are changed, and thus any legal use of the term is understood to require new research practically any time it comes up.""""

Again, I use IQ (i.e. the value I estimated) as a criterion for assessing the user's ability to be an admin or his ability to produce a valid vote on RfA. It is a nonsense, but  I find the criterions for most of the oppose votes equally laughable. And I didn't disrupt wikipedia to make a point, thus I didn't violate WP:POINT. I have the same rights as the other editors, and saying that """"he didn't pass my IQ test"""" is not the same as if I was saying """"he is stupid"""", thus this is no personal attack. Pure logic, if I say a didn't pass my test because it's not bigger than 10, it doesn't mean that a is lower than 5. Thus, a feels offended only if it wants to feel offended. Got that? ackoz  """,0

Speedy deletion of Lucinda Scala Quinn
 A tag has been placed on Lucinda Scala Quinn requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Hey, thanks for your responsiveness about the """"Stolen Earth"""" images. Now, let me genuinely try to be constructive for once, in return: how about that other old idea of yours about having an image from that climax scene of the doctor dying? It would be a bit similar to the """"Last of the Time Lords"""" one we fought over so hard, but unlike in that case, here you'd actually have the """"critical analysis"""" in place, because the scene is covered substantially, and not just in the sense of a renarration of the plot. How about one of those with Rose holding the dying Doctor in her arms, like here, caption along the lines of: """"The climactic final scene, described as a """"bitter moment of high emotion"""", as the Doctor is seemingly dying in Rose's arms. (bah, a bit long, but you get my drift.) (Trouble is, if you want it in the infobox, you'll probably want a longish caption to make the analytic significance transparent. In my opinion at least, it really helps if the caption refers explicitly to the analytic aspect, rather than just to the plot.)  ☼

"""Whether or not Finkelstein's commentary here merits inclusion I'm not sure, since it would depend on whether or not he has something unique to say in regards to this particular issue, and I'm not sure he does. In regards to F.'s status as a reliable source however, there should be no argument about that. F. most certainly qualifies. He is one of the most high-profile scholars on the Arab-Israeli question, he has received plaudits from other greatly respected experts in the field (see Schlaim's endorsement above, or that of Raul Hilberg who supported his work and said he would be """"vindicated"""" by history), and he has written best selling books on the conflict that have been  praised both inside and outside academia and translated into multiple languages. His book A Nation on Trial was named a notable book for 1998 by the New York Times. His latest book """"Beyond Chutzpah"""" was published by the University of California Press after perhaps the most thorough peer review of any book on the conflict ever. These achievements demonstrate that he is unquestionably a reliable source in Wikipedia terms.

In spite of this however, some pro-Israeli editors have seized upon his recent denial of tenure as a rationale for trying to exclude him as a source on the grounds that this failure has somehow discredited his scholarship. This is simply not the case. DePaul did not question the quality of his scholarship. In fact, it endorsed him as """"a prolific writer and outstanding teacher"""". F. was denied tenure only because someone didn't like his attitude. But there is nothing in Wiki policies that disqualify sources on the basis of some alleged flaws of personality. It's only the reliability of their scholarship that matters, and F. has no shortage of endorsements in that regard.

"Lugnuts is merely stating this can be done, even, if you like, can be gotten away with. I think 1ragincajun's question was more concerned than just wondering about what is possible or not. In Wikipedia film articles I've come across ridiculous, tiny detail by detail plot synopses from beginning right through to the very end. And, yes, that's 'allowable', but can be very annoying to many. The problem further is that then there may be no real in depth discussion of the film beyond giving the structure of the plot away, leaving a shallow, spoiling article.

So I was a bit relieved to find the current Norwegian Wood synopsis.  It doesn't seem to have been suggested much, though ideal would be for films to have a separate full plot Wikipedia page, containing the full synopses first also. It would leave it possible for people who haven't seen a film to read the main film article page without having to learn of what happens through to the end.

Anyway, ideally, I agree with 1ragincajun. Isn't it possible to be a bit more vague about the development, including something like - 'the hero's life develops with these 2 love interests in an emotionally tight film involving tragedy'? Just a thought.",0

“Wikipedia is an encyclopedia written collaboratively by many of its readers”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Introduction

“The term collaborative writing refers to projects where written works are created by multiple people together (collaboratively) rather than individually. Some projects are overseen by an editor or editorial team, but many grow without any of this top-down oversight.”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_writing

“Volunteers do not need any formal training before creating a new article or editing an existing article. The people who create and edit articles in Wikipedia come from countries all around the world and have a wide range of ages and backgrounds.”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Who_writes_Wikipedia

“Neutral point of view is a fundamental Wikimedia principle and a cornerstone of Wikipedia. All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been published by reliable sources. This is non-negotiable and expected of all articles, and of all article editors. For guidance on how to make an article conform to the neutral point of view, see the NPOV tutorial; for examples and explanations that illustrate key aspects of this policy, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view

“Bias -NPOV requires views to be represented without bias. All editors and all sources have biases—what matters is how we combine them to create a neutral article. One can think of unbiased writing as the fair, analytical description of all relevant sides of a debate, including the mutual perspectives and the published evidence. When editorial bias toward one particular point of view can be detected, the article needs to be fixed.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view

“Neutrality disputes and handling - A common type of dispute is when an editor asserts that a fact is both verifiable and cited, and should therefore be included.  In these types of disputes, it is important to note that verifiability lives alongside neutrality, it does not override it. A matter that is both verifiable and supported by reliable sources might nonetheless be proposed to make a point or cited selectively; painted by words more favorably or negatively than is appropriate; made to look more important or more dubious than a neutral view would present; marginalized or given undue standing; described in slanted terms which favor or weaken it; or subject to other factors suggestive of bias.

 British Museum stuff 

I've removed:""""In the British Museum there is a genealogy in a manuscript of the Cottonian Collection showing a lineage of Gruffydd ap Cynan. It shows he is the father of Owain Gwynedd and the grandfather to Madawc (another spelling for Madoc). Also in the same collection is a Latin manuscript Vita Griffini Regis (The life of King Gruffydd) that says Gruffydd is the son of Cynan ab Iago and father to Owain Gwynedd - and Owain's son found unknown lands."""" Earlier I removed """"This manuscript as talked about in the Cottonian Collection has a date on it of 1477"""". 
First, there are quite a few Madocs/Madogs/Madawcs etc, so genealogies are of not much use here.
Secondly, why are we claiming that the manuscript says this without a link to it? There is an annotation that says """" Vita Griffini, filii Conani, regis Venedotiae vel Northwalliae, à Thelwello jurisperito Latine versa: ad finem carmina reperiuntur Meredithi de Madoco, filio Oweni Gwynnedd, et ejus navigatione ad terras incognitas; Wallice. Vixit Meredithus iste circa An. 1477"""". Note that this is not a date on the manuscript.

Cristina,

Am I allowed to wish you a Happy Valentine's day, or is that verboten?!

Anyway, how are things? Have you moved into the new apartment yet? If not when? I'm really looking forward to paying you a visit and seeing it for myself - and of course you and Kerim! Don't forget when you are settled to send me some pics of the place.

You asked about Connie and Elvira. They are both well thanks. Tomorrow Connie will visit her parents for a couple of weeks to celebrate the New Year. It must be amazing to be in China for their New Year - it is such a big event. I know travelling and hotels in China at this time is a nightmare, but I still think it would be an unforgettable experience. Maybe next year..  Life in Peru is good; no news though. I'll phone Elvira this afternoon and then see her on messenger this evening after German. Are you and Kerim going to do anything special today? Romantic meal with wine and candles, followed by a quiet walk under a moonlit sky?! Or will he come home late from work, drunk and with lipstick on his collar?  ;-)

Is next Monday a bank holiday for you? It is here but I'm not too sure what to do. Claire has invited me to Lake Constance, something I need to think about. Or I could spend three days studying German -(  Blöödy German. If Europe wants one common currency, then why not also one common language? (Not French - Sorry Kerim!) To be honest I don't like my German lessons. The teaching format is, for me, very unconventional. There is very little reading and writing - almost nothing. Instead we are 'supposed' to learn through talking and repeating. While I know this will be perfect for some, not everyone can learn in this way. I sure you know the three ways people learn: aural, visual and kinestic. Well I know I'm a mixture of visual and kinestic. And when it comes to learning a language I have to see it written on paper, write it several times and actually use the words. Also she, the teacher, is not supposed to talk in English. Which begs the question how can she explain something complex without explaining to us in our own language. OK, enough moaning about German!

Thankfully I am not suffering from spending yesterday evening in the gym. I am hoping that I become addicted to the place and that I *have* to go to get my 'fix'. Tomorrow I have a fitness assessment which will be interesting. Next week will be the induction and I shall be given a program to follow. They also have lots of classes which is one of the reasons I chose to join this gym. Along with the muscle/fitness classes they also have more relaxing classes: yoga, pilates, etc. which I quite like. I find listening/understanding the class instructor hard enough in English, so to do it in German will be amusing! The gym I go to is in the centre but there is one closer to my home; not too sure how to get there though. Elvira wasn't pleased when I told her the showers and saunas are mixed! You know how jealous those latinas are ;-)

OK, time for me to leave you in peace. Please give my greetings to all and you take care. I shall be in touch again soon.

Besitos,

No prob.  Thanks for contacting me.  Believe me, I'd rather help you than block you.  So, here's some reading material:  Wikipedia:Manual of style.  This is an excellent resource for learning how to contribute here.  I'm also as close as my talk page.  Sorry to have come off harsh, but you wouldn't believe the sort of really weird edits from people who mean to harm the site instead of help it.  I'm extremely pleased to help you if you'd like. -  

Wiki brah, why did you move a nomination for admin?  I'm not objecting, just confused.  Also, btw, how did you come across that page - it's not a usual page for new users to come across at first. Thanks in advance for your response.

Uh, right.  )

WB, what are you doing...?  I said I'd help you but if you do another edit like that last one, it'll be a time out.  OK?  No more weirdness?  Thanks. -  

Well, in order to stay, your articles really need to meet a certain level of quality.  I'm sure you mean well, but you really need to settle down a tad and get a feel for the site.  You can't treat this like a blog page.  """"Ho cakes?""""  I admit, it made me laugh, especially the """"featured article"""" header.  But...stuff like that really isn't the best use of the site's resources.  The nice folks who pay for the servers want the best possible return on their investment.  Tell you what:  I have to run, but if you have an idea for an article, why not stop by my talk page and let me know what it is?  Maybe if I show you how to write a good article, you might understand WIkipedia better. -  

It's OK.  We'll get you up to speed.  However, you should decide on a single user name.  Right now, you're bouncing between three of them.  How 'bout we just stick with this one here? -  

Last warning.  If you continue to post nonsense, or to disrupt Wikipedia by slapping a delete template on Cindy Sheehan, you WILL be blocked.   01:52, August 16, 2005 (UTC)

Actually, that is exactly what I was coming here to do.  That was uncalled for as was """"Monkey spank.""""  Gotta give you a time out for a couple of days for disrupting this site.  Nothing personal.  However, you can still edit this page if you wish to respond to the block. -

But, you need to remember that this isn't a playground and that you simply can't edit the way you have been.  I'm giving you one more chance.

If I really had my way, I would reorganize this page (and every other Survivor page) to be more like other reality TV series in that you have your summary tables, and then a block with each episode detail: in the case of Survivor, you'd have your episode summary, exile reasoning, and voted out reasoning all in the same block.  The title quote would lead up that block.  Now, to do that with the existing S pages would take a loooot of work, so the easy way is to either do trivia (adding length to page), add to the episode summary (eg 'Episode 1 """"Wow, this is Survivor"""" (John)"""": blah blah blah'), or add to where they already are (in the episode summary table).  I think the latter would satisfy the gut feeling that they should be on there without affecting too much of the page.  06:19""",0

Gwen I am sorry that you refuse to provide accountability for the actions you undertook as an Admin.  Accountability is simply providing the basis for which you are creating a block to an editor. 
Since you seem determined to obfuscate and side step in every possible way, instead of simply giving reasons of what I did to merit getting blocked, it does seem that my asking for your cooperation here has run its course.  Your assumption of bad faith of why I am asking for clarification are rude and uncalled for, and clearly self-serving.  I asked you a straight question.  You are not willing to give any justification for why you blocked me.  It is reasonable for me to ask.
The block was reviewed by an interested party, and then removed by an uninterested admin, whom did not see the reasons why you blocked me, it does not feel that you even reviewed why this block was overturned.
As I said Gwen, asking you on a your talk page seems to have run its course.  I am left with the perception that admin functions were not used properly, and interested parties where involved along that side.
I will seek resolution outside of this talk page.  I am very disappointed.    11:00",0

Tone and style of article

Just a passerby and not a wikipedia editor per se. However, I felt compelled to leavea comment regarding the tone and style of the article: it suffer from sounding very personal, and has a tone of what one would expect a non-scholar explaining something in emphatic language. (the overabundance of quotation marks is one symptom, but there are other, such as the """"for the benefit of Europeans"""", which takes away from the neutral tone an encyclopedic article.) I'm not an expert on the subject (in fact I know very little about it, which is why I came here), but even to me it would be better if the page instead sourced a number of published treatises/works on the subject instead of going into a quasi-emotional and ambiguous personal essay-style on the subject. It sounds to me like the article attempts to unite the various concepts and make it as culturally vague and generalized and """"acceptable"""" (as in, lacking cultural, ritual and mythical specifics that would make different versions more characterized) as possible - and this makes the article sounds a little - dare I say - """"New Agey"""". (for lack of a better term.) I think more people would appreciate more specific mythic instances and rituals that specifically dealt with the Great Spirit/Mystery (and also those that established important differences between various views on the subject, as one would expect from proper research) - if those are available - as opposed to the currently rather watered-out explanation. 

As this is a very interesting subject, I'm looking forward to seeing how the article develops. ) Best of luck.

 And just for the record, I (unsurprisingly) sincerely belief that not much new technology will come out of Newman's invention. Even leaving all the contradictions to physics aside, there is a much more pragmatic argument: Any electric motor design which """"only"""" cut backs losses by 50% (going from 90% to 95% efficency) would be of outmost commercial importance. You would be able to go (with bodyguards and lawyers if you prefer) into the development centers of Siemens, EMD, or Bombardier, demonstrate your working prototype and leave as a very rich man.
   
RI^2 = heat losses
RI*(meters/ohm) = current times distance = current momentum
Current momentum can be determined by integrating current along the length of wire (with dl as the derivative length).  It can be found in the Biot-Savart law.
To maximize current momentum / heat losses, the following should be maximized:
RI*(meters/ohm) / RI^2 = (meters/ohm)/I = cross-sectional area of wire / (resistivity * current)
But current momentum produces the magnetic field, the square of which is proportional to its energy.  So to maximize the energy of the magnetic field / heat loss.
R^2*I^2*(meters/ohm)^2 / RI^2 = R*(meters/ohm)^2 = distance^2/ohm
Just use a longer wire! I guess the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy, causing electromagnetic radiation. Even the simple movement of a charge can cause a magnetic field, causing acceleration, and therefore radiation! If the wire is so short, that is like shorting the battery (e.g. connecting them in series) and not using the charges to your advantage.  

OK, so I'd like to start by saying that I may more or less completely misunderstand you, but (apart from a very good remark about the mass to energy conversion), your statements look rather heterodox to me. Granted, Newman would have to have found new physics to make his machine work, but I assume we are discussing textbook physics and EE in this side note. Specifically:
 It's not the resistive (heat) losses (or other losses) which bound the electric motor's efficency to 100%. Even using a supraconducting coil and everything you wish, you won't get above 100%  the counter voltage induced by the rotation will make the input power needed to sustain rotation equal to mechanical work done.
 Equal amount of copper will give you motors of equal parameters, only with voltages and currents scaled in different, compensating directions. E.g. both thse setups will give the same magnetic field and motor operation:
 1 meter of 0,15 mm diameter copper wire (about 1 Ω) at 4 V and 4 A (stall current) and
 4 meter of 0,075mm diameter copper wire (about 16 Ω) at 16 V and 1 A (stall current)
 But I agree with your guess that the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy. Every time some energy is transported away from a system, the system loses mass according to E=mc²  in most cases an unmeasurable low amount. Also if you temporarily attach strings to the oppositely charged bodies, you can extract mechanical energy while reducing their distance, exactly that amount of mass will be lost (If we keep the system isolated, its total mass stays the same, e.g when letting the two bodys clonking together, the energy will first be converted to kinectic energy, then to heat, and both contribute to the mass of the system, which in effect stays constant). But in a motor the movement is periodic, so there is nothing in sight which can result in mass loss  unless some copper atoms are vanishing mysteriously or sort of transmutate into something other than normal copper.

I still see an overwhelming majority at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hectagon for delete, merge or redirect, which is consensus that Wikipedia does not need these as separate articles.

I will object, remove, or mark as dubious any use I see of Hectagon. It's a non-word, use rarely and in error; it is used much more often as a misspelling of Hexagon or Heptagon.

 Fairness and neutrality of admins - your recourse 

Hi Nancy,

I think it's a difficult question regarding whether admins have treated you fairly or not.  I think you are not wholly innocent but I'm not convinced that you have been treated with an even hand either.

As you may know, I was surprised at and somewhat nonplussed that you and Xandar were blocked.  Heck, the whole straw poll/IAR/block incident is questionable in my book.  However, it all happened so quickly and during a period when I was less active at Wikipedia so I chose not to raise a ruckus about it as it seemed to be a fait accompli by the time I learned about it.

I gather you were rather strident at WP:ANI which is what triggered your block.  This all seems to be """"water under the bridge"""" by now so, rather than reopen old wounds, I would counsel that you learn from the experience and tone down your emotions even if you are being treated unfairly.

That said, it's clear to me that there has been a bit of admin myopia seeing incivility on your part while ignoring the same or worse on the part of other editors such as PManderson and others.  I have remarked on this a number of times at Talk:Catholic Church but did not act on it at the time because I was an involved admin.  (I'm not an admin anymore so I couldn't act on it now if I wanted to.)

As much as I think the current Catholic Church RFC over versions is ill-advised and likely to be inconclusive, it is now underway so I think we should let it run its course.  Once it's done, you might wish to consider a user conduct RFC to raise the fairness issues.  Note that user conduct RFCs are required to be restricted to one specific user.  Thus, you may wish to raise user conduct RFCs on different users such as UberCryxic, PManderson and even SlimVirgin.

I'm not saying that such user conduct RFCs will get you the satisfaction that you seem to wish.  However, I'm just pointing out what recourse you have if you choose to go down that road.  I reserve the right to decide my response to any such RFCs based upon the facts presented at the time.  (How's that for being a weasel?  Sorry.)

If there seems to be a consensus that you were treated unfairly, the results of the user RFC could be brought up in various forums such as WP:ANI or WP:ARBCOM.  Based on the history to date, however, you should take into account the fact that it is not a clear-cut case of unfair treatment so the user conduct RFCs could get quite contentious.  You have to decide for yourself whether or not issuing them would be worth it.

I would appreciate if you could show me what can be done in each of paragraphs:

1st paragraph:
Having been the early Brazilian republican period, nothing more than a Army dictatorship, already in 1891 from the unfoldings of the bubble of encilhamento and the 1st naval revolt, the country entered in a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by several rebellions, both civilian as military, which little by little undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930, in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most military, lead a revolt.

2nd:
Vargas and the military, who were supposed to assume the government temporarily to implement democratic reforms related to 1891's Constitution, closed the Congress and ruled with emergency powers, replacing the states' governors with their supporters. Under the Claiming of the broken promises of changing, in 1932 the oligarchy of São Paulo tried to regain the power and in 1935 the Communists rebelled, having both been defeated. Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections launching a coup d'état in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship. In May 1938, there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists.

3rd:
In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of this period, was followed by a failed attempt to permanently exert a prominent role in the League of Nations, after its involvement in World War I. In World War II Brazil remained neutral until August of 1942, when the country entered in that war on the allied side after suffer retaliations undertaken by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, due the country have severed diplomatic relations with them in the wake of Pan-American Conference. With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, being the Democracy """"reinstated"""" by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before. Having returned to power democratically elected at the end of 1950, Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis.

 Recent rename to Relationships between American Jewish religious movements 

I don't understand why this article renamed. All of the major movements involved  Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform  have both international histories and a contemporary international presence. The current article content does unduly reflect an American point of view, but this can be fixed. Best,  
I did this because, after reading the page over several times, it only had US denominational connection. True we might all be aware that each of the denominations has an international counterpart - but that isn't reflected on this page, by its creator or subsequent, numerous editors. Of course if this was not the proper thing to do, it can be changed back...but the whole page would need to be heavily added to. It is a shame this couldn't be purged entirely and a new section added to the denomination page. Best wishes,  

Agreeing with Shirahadasha, I don't think it makes sense to limit this article to American movements. Better to fix the content, because the geographic limit is quite artificial. For instance, what about Israeli Orthodox commenting on American movements, or vice versa? We certainly don't want to have this """"relationships"""" topic segmented for UK and Germany and Hungary, because movements and individuals  constantly interact and comment across geographic boundaries. We need to revisit the title.  | Talk 

Before we worry about the world-wide perspective - which I agree would be interesting - perhaps we should focus first on getting a well sourced WP:NPOV article on the USA.  There is a huge amount of material on the US alone to sort through.   

Several problems. (1) Many sources and notable figures do not limit their remarks to a geographic denomination. Hence, when R. Feinstein or Joel Roth comment on other movements, they don't refer only to Jews and organizations within the US. (2) Accordingly, the current article's content is not limited to the US. (3) The discourse of the movements cannot be segregated geographically enough to justify segregated articles. For these reasons, I will would like to move it back and open the discussion here. Thanks.  | Talk 

There is plenty of material available (e.g. historical, socialogical, literary) that is indeed region specific.  This article hasn't even begun to scratch the surface of that material.
Why is it relevant that Joel Roth says things that are worldwide? If claim A applies to US and claim A applies to Israel, then A is appropriate in any of the following three articles: (a) an article on the US (b) an article on israel and (c) an article on the US and israel.
The material on other areas (e.g. israel) is volumous - Israel deserves its own article.
If we write a good article on the US and then start writing one on Israel, and while writing the one on israel notice that we need to reuse material, then we can always add a third article with the shared material.
Even if we need shared material (e.g. for Israel and the US) it does not change the fact that both countries have denominational relationships that are complex enough and sufficiently sourced to each need their own article.
Finally, its better to do a little well, then try to do too much and do it poorly.   

(outdent) The following aspects of the article are not limited to internal USA relationships:
 Haredi views of Modern Orthodox, generally 
 R. Feinstein on non-Orthodox Jews
 Haredia on """"heretical intent and the 1800s widespread denigration of religion.""""
 Modern Ortho on non-Orthodox generally
 R. Soloveitchik  not discussing American non-Ortho alone
 R. Lamm saying """"non-Orthodox rabbis and laypeople may possess spiritual dignity"""" etc
 R. Berger: """"The Jewish loyalties and observances of non-Orthodox Jews are decidedly better than nothing."""" etc
 Conservative views of Orthodox are not limited to American Orthodox, and general view is held by Masorti/Conservative too
 R. Schorsch: """"claimed that Orthodox organizations in Israel politically discriminate against non-Orthodox Jews"""" obviously not US
 The Reform section is not only USA, mostly historical
Given this content, I would like to undo the recent move and switch the burden of proof for changing the name of this long-standing article. This can be done either as a BRD move or as a Requested Move. Thanks. [[U",0

 Inline translated refs 

Yes, your example on my talk page is a perfectly reasonable way to go about it.  You could also just provide the translations on the talk page, with a note that you're leaving them there in case anyone needs them.  You might consider including the original text as well as the translation.  After all, a few readers will understand Croatian.

As for using inline refs:  It's really fairly simple.  You just take the same text that you'd use for the regular citation, but instead of putting it at the end, under ==References==, you put it in the article, and put  before the footnote text, and  after it.  (What's confusing is trying to use the citation templates for inline refs, but those are strictly optional.)

If it's a ref that you expect to use repeatedly, then you name it:   (instead of just  at the beginning).  Then to re-use it, you only have to put    and the Wiki software will know that you want it to be the same number and citation text that you used earlier.  (Note the slash at the end.  Also, that's the whole thing for the subsequent uses:  there's no citation text after it and no  needed after it.)

Finally, if that sort of inline ref isn't your preference, then you might prefer what some people call """"Harvard style"""" references, or Author-date-page references.  For that, you skip all the  stuff, and just put plain text at the end of a statement like this:  

The moon is big (Smith 2008:25).

That means that you found this information in a publication written by someone whose last name is Smith, published in 2008, on page 25.  Then you put a regular alphabetized list of citations at the bottom of the page, and the reader just scans down to see who Smith is if the reader is interested.  This """"parenthetical style"""" is easy to type, and it puts less clutter in the middle of your article, so some people strongly prefer it.  

Remember that any complete, organized and understandable system of references is supposed to be accepted at FAC, not just the one that seems most common on Wikipedia articles.  Good luck,   """,0

Bad Agendas written in to this article
Hello folks, I'm not a wiki-writer.  I just use it from time to time.  But I am familiar with problems when some pages have points of view and agendas written in to them, and the American Civil War articles are rife with these problems.  You'd think the war was still on.  This article on the 43rd Battalion is generally very good, but someone has done their best to wreck the ship, nevertheless.  A paragraph in this article goes off-track and attempts to paint a picture that these soldiers were """"guerillas"""".  Anyone familiar with the writings of the war knows this word was used extensively and daily in newspapers, official US Army reports and accounts to refer to not just uniformed soldiers of the CS Army, but to any and all people of the South.  To discuss the use of this term in this article is a coy trick to insert an agenda, intended to disparage, vice simply communicate good Wiki information about this topic.  """"Guerilla"""" was so commonly used as a term in this war, that it cannot be said, at all, that this term applied to, or was used more commonly for any one unit or group in the war, than any other.  If editors continue to keep this slant and bias in the article, and contiue deleting other fair contributions which are neutral, then my comment here serves as a marker to future editors of the proof of the problem in this page, and the particular set of self-chosen watch-guards who intend to keep it here, while pretending they are not the root cause of the problem.""",0

 Negative real interest rates on US public debt 

Regarding , , , and  why do you think those edits were """"cut/paste of blog referenced original research""""?

 Napoleon Zervas 
 Dear Helladios can you stop deleting my input. You have no right to censore someone elses opinion. You are not God. Napoleon Zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the cham albanians

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses a",0

"""What I was saying was that South Africa was never a """"black"""" country. The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, """"independecne"""" and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up. The economy is approximately 15 % what it was under """"deliberate discrimination"""". There are massive blackouts every day, and the only people who are well off are the Marxist puppets who are the ANC, the druglords, and people who install security systems. That's part of what I meant.

 Edit disagreements  

Where are you getting the figure range for '300-3000' from? I couldn't find these figures in any of the sources you cited, unless you're estimating based on predictions from the article.
Abu Omar al-Shishani is not the chief in command of both Iraq and Syria. This is ridiculous. I don't know why so many people believe this. I suspect it might be becuase he is so prevalent in the IS propaganda that he is somehow the Islamic State's version of Napoleon Bonaparte. I cannot find any reputable source claiming he is anything more than a field commander in northern Syria. He doesn't even feature in any IS leadership hierarchies, which are almost exclusively staffed by Iraqis who have been in the organisations since the early-mid 2000's. When the former commander of the IS Military Council passed away in June 2014 (Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi), Iraqi secutyi forces found some memory sticks and a laptop containing the following leadership information currently pieced together by western analysts. Note how al-Shishani doesn't feature in any of them, save one which turned out to be incorrect. Here they are: , , . Here is the false one which showed al-Shishani succeeding al-Bilawi as the IS military chief of the Military Shura: . However, it was Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another IS Iraqi commander who had been in the organisation years before al-Shishani had joined who succeeded al-Bilawi as the Chief of the Military Shura. He is shown in the graph as Adnan Latif Hamid al-Sweidawi which is his real name. You never see the upper echelons of the IS hierarchy, the ones who actually control everything. They are not shown in IS propaganda. They are clandestine, mysterious, shadowy figures. Only the pawns are revealed.
You keep stating that Jamaat-ul-Ahrar have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. This is just not true. You might get this impression becuase they broke away from the TTP or the Pakistani Taliban, which swear allegiance to the head of the Afghan Taliban Mullah Omar. But the spokesperson for Jamaat-ul-Ahrar stated that they pledged allegiance to the Taliban leader . The leader of Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Omar Khalid has strong ties to Ayman al-Zawahiri and Al-Qaeda, a nemesis to the Islamic State. 
You state that Abu Sayyaf have sworn allegiance to the Islamic State, however, the man who swore allegiance to them is not the groups leader, so it is unclear whether or not he is representing Abu Sayyaf or a splinter faction. 
You write that Ansar al-Islam is an Al-Qaeda affiliate, but I can find little to no proof affirming this position. The leadership of Ansar al-Islam have rejected the notion that they swear allegiance to al-Qaeda, despite collaborating with their affiliates, such as the al-Nusra Front.U.S. terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna in January 2003 however disagreed with Krekar and affirmed links of Ansar with al-Qaeda: “Ansar al-Islam has links with al-Qaeda – in fact it is an associate group of al-Qaeda”.]. The U.S Defense Intelligence Agency seemed to have affirmed this when they wrote """"Ansar al-Islam is an independent organization that receives assistance from al-Qaeda, but is not a branch of the group.""""DIA, Special Analysis, July 31, 2002, cited in Postwar Findings about Iraq's WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How they Compare with Prewar Assessments, pg. 71.""",0

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. 

III. 

It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for",0

"Zondervan 

Thanks for the feedback. One point I'd like to make, however:

The main controversy surrounding Zondervan is somewhat of an internal affair to Christianity: the controversy is entirely over whether or not Zondervan should be trusted, seeing as it is owned by a secular media company. I would suppose that secular sources would be rather unlikely to pick up on the story, seeing how it is mostly irrelevant to those unconcerned with Christianity and the state of one of its publishers. From the (admittedly horrible) site http://www.kingdombaptist.org/new-bible-versions-and-the-growing-pornographic-industry/ 
Let’s examine this from another angle. Has News Corp. always allowed their subsidiaries to operate autonomously? While driving the other day I happened to hear a bit of the Marlin Maddox radio program. They main topic was the remark that the younger Murdock made concerning Falon Gong and China (I am surprised no one called in to comment on the NIV.) They were enraged at the Murdocks for “selling out” and turning a blind eye to the sufferings of the people under Communism. China represents the world’s largest media market. It is five times larger than the U.S. market. The Murdocks do not want to do anything to disrupt cashing in on that market. Marlin Maddox had an interview with a man who fled China; he had been dropped from a HarperCollins publishing deal because his important book was speaking out against the Chinese. The U.S. News reported in 1998:
“The scandal that could have far-reaching repercussions involved HarperCollins, a unit of News Corp. The publishing house last month dropped a book by Christopher Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong. The ostensible reason was that the writing was inadequate. But the
action fit a pattern of Murdoch’s adjusting editorial policies so as not to offend the Chinese leadership in Beijing. Murdoch’s News Corp. has invested heavily in a satellite broadcasting business based in Hong Kong and eventually hopes to be able to beam programming to mainland China’s huge population. Murdoch denied ordering that the book be dropped. But a memo by HarperCollins Chairman Eddie Bell, which surfaced last week, indicated otherwise: ‘Murdoch has outlined to me the negative aspects of publication, which I fully understand,’…After being pilloried in newspapers, Murdoch issued a limited apology to Patten for any suggestion that his book had been rejected for “being too boring.” HarperCollins later reached an out-of-court financial settlement with Patten, who had threatened to sue the publishing house…During the HarperCollins contretemps, potentially damaging remarks on China by a former Times writer also came to light. ‘The Times has simply decided, because of Murdoch’s interests, not to cover China in a serious way,’ Jonathan Mirsky, the paper’s former East Asian editor, said at a conference in January, according to a transcript that recently appeared on the Internet.” (3-23-98)
Thus, the “top” does control the bottom – when it cares to. And why not? A man ought to have right to control his businesses in whatever manner he chooses. And we ought to have the right to REJECT anything associated with the pornographic industry!
You can see how such an issue would both be a controversy, and something unlikely to be covered by many secular news outlets.",0

"""== Blood fetish ==
Regarding blood fetish: please don't suggest to people that:
 - a common way of finding out whether a person would be safe to engage in bloodplay with is for them to go to their local blood donation organisation, who check blood if it is safe and contains no diseases before it will be stored.
Using a blood donation organization as a proxy STD test is highly irresponsible; if the testing is not 100% perfect (and in never is), and the person trying this is positive (and presumably anyone who is considering doing this considers this to be entirely possible), they will almost certainly (because of pre-test blood pooling, and the very large blood volumes involved) infect one or more unwitting third parties with a potentially lethal disease.

Instead, they should get tested at their local sexual health clinic.    

People just wanting to make sure are no more likely to have an STD than other first-time blood donors.. I don't see your point: If that kind of carelessness goes on things would happen *anyway*  (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉) 

It's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you """"I've never done anything like this before, either"""". Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.   

Hmm I guess that makes sense, kinda

I would be interested in reading if you feel like creating articles for """"assortative mixing"""" and """"risk tolerance"""" maybe  or   (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉)

I'm not familiar with the article or the subject of its concern, but I fail to see how saying """"X does Y"""" constitutes an actual endorsement of Y.  If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.   

Karada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.  If we were to remove all content that describes inadvisable behavior, then we would also have to remove Collectivism, Fascism, Socialism, Christianity, Communism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Democracy, New England Patriots, Detroit Pistons, and Houston Astros.   

It's also worth noting that there are some bloodborne diseases that we can't yet test for.  (Prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease comes to mind.)  In addition to spreading these diseases to one's blood play partners, one would then potentially infect one or more innocent bystanders each time one donated blood.  Most jurisdictions also bar donations from individuals who have recently (in the last 12 months) come in contact with another person's blood.  Lying to the nurses when they ask about this stuff could conceivably make you civilly and/or criminally liable for any morbidity or mortality resulting from a tainted blood donation. (talk)

The article is very well written and structured. Allow me to express my gratitude to you on your contribution.

"Andy, thank you very much! )  What are the locations of those lost buildings?  All in Aachen?  I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?",0

 About """"Two Chinas"""" 

I re-wrote and expanded the """"History"""" section for several reasons.
 One, I think """"Background"""" is more appropriate since the article is about the term """"Two Chinas"""". There is no actual thing as """"Two Chinas"""". So a section that deals with the background of the situation described by the term is better called """"Background"""" and not """"History"""" - """"History"""" should be used for a section on the history of the term.
 Two, there was a lot of misleading content in the article, such as the stuff about the Ruijin Soviet: I've seen that claim (that the Ruijin Soviet was the first time there were """"two Chinas"""") bandied about in online forums and anti-Communist China magazines from time to time, but it is factually untrue, since China was split between many autonomous entities throughout the Republican period, and the Ruijin Soviet was no different from any of them.
 In re-writing the Background section I was hoping to illustrate that history of division and separation in order to place the final division that led eventually to the current situation in a historical context.

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

My stance of being a """"Proud Nintendo 3DS Owner"""" has absolutely nothing to do with me taking a neutral position or not in the discussed article.

You're getting this """"Yes/No template"""" thing all wrong, seriously. Someone at my talk page said the following: """"To use an extreme example: """"Does the console kill people?"""", the answer is """"No"""", which is a positive."""". So by your philosophy would you color it with green because it's a good thing? Wrong. No, consoles do not kill people and yes, it is POSITIVE, but this does not invalidate the fact that it still is something NEGATIVE related to the question. Even the the templates themselves have by default the green color for yes and the red color for no, and that must already  mean something by itself. The purpose of Wikipedia is objectivity, not subjectivity. But what the reader does with the information is entirely up to him. Which means that if he thinks that something positive/colored green is a negative thing for him, that's his problem. He can think whatever he wants of this information. I hope this clears things up."""". To sum it up: Yes=Affirmative=Green / No=Negative=Red, personal preferences don't come into account.

There is no need to """"de-emphasize,"""" since there is no better place for the """"Official"""" name than the lead. I will not repost sources, since a good look at the archives will provide sources (primary, secondary, tertiary) that states the official name.

"From the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia:
black codes, in U.S. history, series of statutes passed by the ex-Confederate states, 1865–66, dealing with the status of the newly freed slaves. They varied greatly from state to state as to their harshness and restrictiveness. Although the codes granted certain basic civil rights to blacks (the right to marry, to own personal property, and to sue in court), they also provided for the segregation of public facilities and placed severe restrictions on the freedman's status as a free laborer, his right to own real estate, and his right to testify in court. Although some Northern states had black codes before the Civil War, this did not prevent many northerners from interpreting the codes as an attempt by the South to reenslave blacks. The Freedmen's Bureau prevented enforcement of the codes, which were later repealed by the radical Republican state governments.",0

Hi, I removed the story you posted on Cuurent Events for several reasons:
 The story didn't seem to belong on the date where you placed it. If the story was reported in a newspaper dated January 13th, it shouldn't be listed under the January 20th events.
 I know this may be an important story in Belize, but (as far as I can tell) only one newspaper is carrying it and there are no hits on Google News. It doesn't appear to be of global importance, which is usually what it takes to be included on Current Events.
 The summary was way too long. Two or three sentences is usually the maximum for a summary. If it wasn't for the first two points, I would have attempted to edit the summary instead of deleting. 

For now, I'm going to remove the story, but if you can find more sources, please feel free to include a short summary and link on the correct date.  18:44, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)",0

"""Sockpuppet or not, which I don't see any sockpuppet tags on, its still not an excuse for uncivil behaviour. There is no excuse for uncivil behaviour. 
Of course it doesn't have sockpuppet tags on. It's brand new, created for the sole purpose of vandalization. It's somebody breaking the rules. And BTW, I was not being uncivil. It wasn't a threat, it was a very specific promise of how I would follow up with his continued disruption, and I will.  You are being uncivil by continuing to harrass me, and also unreasonable in thinking somehow a sockpuppet created for the sole intention of vandalization actually can have its feelings hurt. This is what I would at this point consider the end of the discussion. Anything else would be a sign of uncivility.  
I'm not being remotely uncivil. I left a message and asked you not to be. You've now continued your uncivil behaviour by blanking warnings from your talk page. Promise or threat amounts to the same uncivil behaviour. There was no reason to threaten them with an IP ban. 
You are attacking me with warnings and attempting to set me up for behaving in an uncivil manner so you can complain about me, probably to subvert the vote for deletion against the Michael Everson article. You responded to my warning the vandal about his vandalism so quickly, it raises my suspicion that it may be in retaliation for my very quick reversion of the vandalism that occured at the AfD. You are behaving in such a manner that seems to be attempting to troll me by continued action after being warned to leave me alone. I disagree with you plainly that I behaved uncivily. It is not required of me to agree with you. I also consider your warning of me behaving uncivily a personal attack and am removing it. 
If you want to find an arbitrator for arguing over nothing, that is directly your next step as per the arbitration guidelines.   
Leaving a warning template for obviously uncivil behaviour isn't uncivil. Otherwise no one could leave them. Retaliating with that template however is uncivil. I've pointed out the issue with your behaviour, you can correct it or not, but launching a personal attack against me won't help you. As for the AfD you're involved in, I could care less, I have no interest in it. 
And again I'll remind you: You are in charge of how you behave and respond. """"set me up for behaving in an uncivil manner"""". If you behave uncivily, its your fault, no one else's. No one has held a gun to your head to force you to act in the manner you are.

 Vallentine Mitchell also seems like a quite partisan Jewish pub. 
 At least 4 out of 6 explicitly named authors are also Jewish. 

Moreover, the article also fails to mention the political office that the author has held in the past, Louisiana House of Representative;  and the history doctorate he holds.

Therefore, I added POV, one source, and ref improve tags until the article is balanced and completed by POVs of the author himself, and sources with less bias and conflict of interest.",0

""" January 2008 (UTC)

Try as I might, I'm not really able to associate your Zebra analogy with this article. For it to work, this would have to be an article about the colour white, and even then it doesn't really work. The purpose of my change is to remove the """"comparison"""" nature of the section. It's not meant to be a comparison to begin with. The problem right now is that the section really violates NPOV - it places weight on a comparison with another format, rather than standing by itself. The fact it mentions Blu-ray means we have a somewhat unnecessary argument going on in the Talk: pages about a graph which is exclusively focussed on comparing Blu-ray and HD DVD studio support. 

To be NPOV, this part of the article needs to focus on what support HD DVD has. Issues such as what proportion of the studios support it are obviously relevant. Issues as to whether they support either of the competing formats (incumbent DVD, as well as Blu-ray) aren't really, except insofar as it should be mentioned that the rivaly exists.

We need to move the fanboi """"HD DVD is better"""", """"No, Blu-ray is better!"""", """"Well, HD DVD has more support!"""", """"No, Blu-ray has more support!"""" crap to the comparison articles.   18:13, 21""",0

And even if you insist that it's an abbreviation, there's still no reason for it to appear in all-caps. The forex page on Wikipedia doesn't even use all-caps for """"forex,"""" so that kind of dumps your argument (not to be rude, but this is the case: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex).

I see that you have recently reverted some edits to the naturopathy page. I note that you have given as your reason that the changes to the lead were POV, but that you have not bothered to explain why you think this is so in the discussion page.

Could you please explain why you think it is POV for the article to describe naturopathy as an approach to medicine rather than a single proffesion or standard of care? Do you dispute the fact, or the way in which it was written? I am open to rewriting/compromising to get consensus on an NPOV, but if you are not willing to explain yourself, this will be very difficult. Do you really think that the umberella term 'naturopathic medicine' is represenatative of single entity, group or way of practicing medicine? Could you back this up?
 Could you also explain why it would be considered POV for the article to mention that the principles of naturopathy are practiced in multiple settings (complementary, alternative, and primary care) by traditional healers, NDs, MDs, DOs DC's etc...? Again, do you dispute this fact or the way it was written? I have provided citations for this, did you even consult them before deleting my work? Can you provide a citation asserting the opposite (that naturopathic medicine is an exlusive term owned and used by a single organisation to the exlusion of other types of practitioners)?
Your assertion that naturopathic medicine is 'CAM, not medicine' could be misconstrued to reveal a deep and irrational bias on your behalf. (What do you imagine the 'M' in 'CAM' stands for?) The fact that the term 'medicine' without a modifier is usually interpretted to mean conventional/regular/normal medicine does not mean that the less common practices are somehow not medicine.

I hope that you will take the time to participate in the discussion of the above on the talk page. I will continue to edit what I see as helpful NPOV information about the complex breadth and scope of naturopathy untill you can explain what it is that you do not like about the contributions I have made. On the one hand I can't work in a vaccuum, but on the other hand I won't be bullied into submission either.

"Comment on correlation 
The year 140 AD is leap year so if Thoht 1 is July 20 in 139 AD
it is July 19 for the next 3 years, all 4 years claimed as the rise of Sothis.
The year 2773 BC is likewise a Thoth 1 on July 17 whose previous year is July 18.
4241 BC is a July 19 date for Thoth 1.
As for correlation placing Egypt's earliets dates as 2170 BC and 2030 BC and 2001 BC etc;
the date for Thoht 1 is Jan 6 in 2001 BC and the winter solstice.
The wprt name for new year has been used for sothis but also for solstice
and not clear whether winter or summer. Connecting it to Nile flood doesnt help
when the myth of Noah's flood is at winter solstice. Further, if Thot is the 7th month
then Epagum days begin July 5 in 2001 BC so that the July 10 solstice is Pamenot 1 not 6.
Every disagreement in short Genesis has a counterpart application in Egypt.
Example, reunification in year 955. If Flood is year 600, and Noah dies in year 350,
he dies in the year 350 that the Pharaoh was created.
If using a 360-day calendar for those 350 years, then from year 600 it is year 955.
Unification of dynasties 1-5 is then the same year and event for dynasties 6-10.
The 5th being dead in Genesis in year 340, but in LXX in year 768.
The date 1872 BC July 17 is Memphis. But what if its at Fort Quban where
sothis rises on July 10 the solstice during the 12th dynasty. That blows those
who try to trace July 20 back to a Gregorian solstice in 4242 BC.
And at the time of that July 10 date in the year 120 of the 12th dynasty,
let's say 1824 BC July 10 as second month Parmuti 16 (versus 8th month 22)
we have Paopi 16 on Jan 6, so which is the wprt sopken of in record, winter or summer sothic.",0

The following are most of the pages that are vandalized is the same way, i.e., adding in bizarre/inappropriate gender references. Most are fairly trivial articles, i.e., recent fashion trends, but some are big and sensitive topics, like rape. In the past, comments people made on talk pages were erased, which is a big faux pas on Wiki.

General vandalism information is here. As I understand it, vandals are to get warnings on their talk pages, 3 or so, from this selection of templates. When that’s been done, the next step is to report the user here, and I guess some admin checks the user out to see if they should be blocked. This particular case is a little more complicated because I think it’s a sock puppet, i.e., using more than one identity to create illusion of support or to evade final warnings and the like. In that case, they can be reported here, but I think you’re supposed to monitor the suspect first to make sure it’s recent violations and so on. I’ve been spending way too much time on Wiki lately, so I’m not prepared to try monitoring this stuff myself, at least for now, but hopefully these resources will be useful.",0

This is total nonsense I'm afraid. I cannot answer for Wales or Northern Ireland, but Scotland has always had devolved government since it co-founded the Union in 1707. The separate legal and education systems were under the control of devolved administrations. And as time went on there were separate, devolved government departments for just about everything else too, eg Agriculture, Transport, Industry, and of course Health (the NHS has always been devolved, since day 1).

What happened in 1999 is that Scotland re-gained a democratically devolved legislature to control the previously largely unchecked devolved government departments.  """,0

 BP 

First of all, I understand that you have a stake in this article.  You've put a lot of time and effort into it and you don't want to see it deleted.  I had an article deleted once, and I understand the frustration that you feel.  

If you read what constitutes a notable organization in WP:N and WP:ORG, it doesn't really meet the criteria set forth.  Yes, you've provided some sources that mention the Bulldog Party, but they aren't really considered, Significant coverage which means, """"that sources address the subject directly in detail..."""".  Also, WP:ORG states """"Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable independent sources can be found,"""" however, it does say that, """"The organization’s longevity, size of membership, or major achievements, or other factors specific to the organization may be considered.""""  The Bulldog Party may have been around in some form since the 1950s, though, so maybe that might help  if you can prove it. 

The possible longevity and the """"major achievements"""" and """"other factors specific to the organization"""" is where you stand the best chance of defining why it's notable, because of this statement in the article, """"The Bulldog Party has inspired the formation of other student organizations on universities throughout Missouri, most notably the Bearcat Voice at Northwest Missouri State University and the Student Progressive Party at Lincoln University (Missouri).""""  However, this isn't sourced at all, and quite frankly, it's questionable whether the Bearcat Party article meet the notability criteria as well.

If I submitted this article to AFD, would it definitely get deleted?  Most definitely not.  There's a good chance that it would, but it's not a given.  However, no one could make the argument that it's good enough as it is and its notability shouldn't be questioned. 

Why has no one else brought this up before since you first created in March 2005?  Probably because it hasn't attracted a lot of attention and overall, it's well-written.  There aren't many other articles that link to it, so unless someone stumbles across it through those links, the only other way someone will find it is via Random Pages (unlikely with over 2 million other articles) or through Recent Changes (and since there have been barely over 50 edits in 3 years, that's not likely, either  especially if the edit wasn't vandalism).

Keep in mind that none of these arguments make an article notable or worth keeping:
 I like it... or It's interesting....
 It took me a long time to write....
 This other student political party has an article....
 It looks good... or It doesn't do any harm...

I'm not going to submit this article to AFD, but you really need to work on getting it fixed (if possible), because it's likely that someday someone else will come across it and come to the very same conclusion that I did about it.   Good luck, and happy editing.    """,0

Re: the """"KKK"""" connection.  

As I recall, Napier forms a rebel group known as the """"Soldiers of Liberty,"""" but to maintain their cover, they only speak the initials of the organization.  I don't recall if we're told the Amtorian word for """"soldier,"""" but we do know that in their universal language, plurals are formed by adding a prefix, either """"kloo-"""" or """"kl-"""" depending upon whether the root word begins with a consonant or a vowel.  We do learn that the Amtorian for """"of"""" is """"kum.""""  Therefore, """"liberty"""" must either be a plural concept, or must begin with a """"k"""" anyawy.  So, the group is named the """"Kl-something kum K-something,"""" initials K-K-K!  We're told that's spoken kung-kung-kung on Venus rather than kay-kay-kay, by the kay ... er, way.

Wait a minute, on this basis, wouldn't just about every Amtorian organization have at least two K's in their initials? Wouldn't the K-K-K get confused with the K-K-P and the K-K-S-K and all the others.?  Hell of a way to carry on covert operations.  Sounds like that Monty Python bit about the Judean People's Front versus the People's Front of Judea and the other splitters.  (""""What!  You're from the kung-kung-kung!  How dare you?""""  """"No, I said kung-kung-bung!"""")

Ergo, it would be pretty stupid to use actual initials given a language that uses kl- before every plural noun.  

Such a language ought to sound pretty awful, and to initiate choking in the speaker whenever a long passage is spoken, but never mind.  If a language expert like Tolkein had pulled something like this, you might infer a sinister motivation, but Burroughs never let logic get in the way of entertainment, and this served him and his readers quite well.

Napier smiles in amusement when his organization is rendered as K-K-K. Given my explanation, he should have laughed out loud.  That's hardly a political endorsement. Pursuing that track is S.O.L., and that ain't Soldiers of Liberty.   05:46, 3 August 2010 (UTC""",0

"""=Sexism in MGS5, relevant to an encyclopedic entry on the game?===
Came back to this article to see if any progress had been made on cleaning it up. Good to see some progress has been made.
I'm going to make a few points here and well.. hopefully people will be rationale and objective about it.

Misinformation. This article is rife with it. It's incredibly important for an encyclopedia to present accurate information. An encyclopedia should not be an opinion column, it should not overly represent any opinion since they are not based on fact, nor relevant to a topic. I'm going to start with the 'Sexualized Portrayal of Quiet' and sadly I'm going to have to tear it apart. Please put how you feel about it or any emotion you may have about the topic aside when you read the following points;

1 - No other character in any other Metal Gear title pages is given this amount of scrutiny. Quiet has been highlighted by the media as sexist, this is true. However this is not a reason for an encyclopedic entry to focus on a given character. The page is not a study of the media's (or anyone else's) reaction to Quiet as a character. There should be balance in the reception section, giving a whole section to Quiet versus no other characters is not balanced.

2 - Misinformation. """"Michael McWhertor criticized Quiet's portrayal, pointing out that while the game explains that her nakedness derives from a photosynthetic skin condition, several other characters with the same condition — such as Code Talker in The Phantom Pain and The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater — appear fully clothed.""""

Regardless of the source of information, if it is incorrect information it should not be in the entry. Quiet is naked because her lungs were burnt to a crisp, the game specifically mentions this and other fans have mentioned it on the page I believe. Code Talker and The End have the same ability correct, but they did not get set on fire and thrown out of a building. I'm really baffled this is in here because McWhertor is not an authority on this whatsoever. Kojima and the game writers are. Source it correctly or remove the information I would have said.

3 - Opinion columns. This baffles me. Why are opinion pieces been taken as reception? They are not professional video game reviewers. By the media's own admission they are just someone writing their opinion about something, it's not objective. They wouldn't even claim to be unbiased as it's an opinion. You are introducing bias here by taking an opinion and presenting it for no reason other than to say """"this person didn't like Quiet's portrayal"""". If tomorrow Donald Trump wrote an opinion piece on Quiet for a media outlet, is that relevant to an encyclopedic entry about something?

4 - Further irrelevant information. There are sources and information here that talk about the PlayArtsKai figurine of Quiet. Are you out of your mind?! What relevance does this have to the RECEPTION OF THE GAME??? The video game this entry is about. To start with PlayArtsKai is a completely separate company that we have no idea or information about how much Hideo Kojima was involved with. One would assume since they are completely different companies ENTIRELY that Konami simply licensed the intellectual property rights of Quiet to PlayArtsKai. It goes without saying but Twitter is not a valid source of information.

5 - Dates. Numerous sources are reactions to the character Quiet and precede the date of release. Thus they are not a reception of the game itself. Hence why are they in a section called """"Reception"""" to start with.

5 - Forbes contributors and Anita Sarkeesian. We seem to have established that Forbes contributors are not valid sources so I expect this will be okay to remove.

Everything else seems to be sourced from valid sources who are professional video game reviewers. Although again I'd suggest that Quiet is getting an amazing amount of spotlight in the article for no other reason than controversy 

To any senior editors, administrators, or anyone with an interest in Wikipedia standards. It should be extremely concerning that this level of bias is present in an article that is supposed to be by and large, factual. 86.40.28.221

Text moved from article

 has been making extensive changes to the article.  Some of them changed clear and precise to less clear and precise language (such as """"implies that"""" to """"leads to the view that""""), some changed one stylistic approach to another, and some turned U.K. in to U.S. English, but the main section is this:

""""The second horn of the dilemma (known as divine command theory) runs into five main problems. First, it implies that the moral status of things is wildly contingent—if he had wanted to, God could have made rape, murder, and torture morally right. Secondly, it threatens the  normative force of the claim that God is good—it turns into the mere claim that God is consistent, or that God approves of himself. Thirdly, it commits the naturalistic fallacy; to analyze evaluative claims (e.g., that murder is wrong) in terms of what God has or hasn't said is to reduce evaluative claims to mere descriptions of God's activity. Fourthly, it seems to make morality subjective, with moral truths determined by the mere attitudes of an individual. Fifthly, it threatens the conception of God as a  rational being. For, supposing God had a reason for forbidding rape, this reason should also be the reason that rape is wrong. Otherwise, God's decision would have been based on the wrong reason. But if the reason rape is wrong is that God has forbidden it, then it can't be God's reason for forbidding it, on pains of circularity. So God's moral decisions were based either on the wrong reason, or on no reason at all.""""

Some of this can usefully added, but some isn't really acceptable: """"is wildly contingent"""" is not only unencyclopædic style, but is less clear than """"is arbitrary, based merely upon god's whim"""".  It also introduces technical terms where they're not needed (as does """"normative force"""" which, in addition, surely misses the target; it's not the normativity of """"god is good"""" that's at issue, but its status as a meaningful evaluation).  His or her fourth point isn't very commonly raised, and is surely implicit in the other points.  The final point contains material that could be made use of, but is in fact a discussion of the article's first point.   (Μελ Ετητης) """,0

 Naming convention violation part #3 

(Tiderolls) The guideline Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English), under the section heading Including alternatives, states that """"The body of each article, preferably in its first paragraph, should list all common names by which its subject is widely known."""" The first sentence of that guideline states """"The title of an article should generally use the version of the name of the subject which is most common in the English language, as you would find it in reliable sources""""...(My emphasis). 

(NCDane) I read the naming convention before my previous message to you, and I considered Naming convention citations I originally provded to to constitute superseding, prima facie authority. I think they are worth repeating, and I will repeat them:German proper names should be treated with care, and attention to English practice

The title of an article should generally use the version of the name of the subject which is most common in the English language''''(TR) That means an editor must support their position by providing sources that show a common English usage. 

(NCD) That is ridiculous because the article's previous authors did not provide citation, and the burden should be on them because they were the ones using a letter which does not exist in the English alphabet. 

Furthermore, you know as well as I do that ~B is not common English usage:  I am sure you, like me,  have NEVER in your life seen it used in ANY English-language publication EXCEPT for Wikipedia, and perhaps the Internet Wiki copycats. 

But since I am up against unreasonable legalism on this issue,  here is the first page of Google ENGLISH LANGUAGE BOOK hits on the name “Uli Hoeness”: 

http://books.google.com/books?id=rQfNyLM5svIC&pg;=PA200&dq;=uli+hoeness&hl;=en&ei;=17IPTYvdG8GB8gat5t3lDQ&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&ved;=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=uli%20hoeness&f;=false

As you can see “Hoeness” is the version used.I also googled the next five pages and can confirm no use of ~B by any other English book source.I also found that the name “Uli Hoeness” does not occur in encyclopedias Brittanica,
Columbia/Bartleby and How Stuff Works.' 

However, it does occur twice as “Hoeness” in infoplease:'''

http://www.infoplease.com/search?q=+hoeness&in;=all&fr;=iptn&x;=45&y;=9

And it occurs 10 times times as “Hoeness” on the 1st page of Encyclopdia.com:

http://www.encyclopedia.com/searchresults.aspx?q=uli+hoeness 

(TR) Did you read the discussion that resulted from your post here? Several editors explained how the rendering of an article's subject spelling is determined. 

(NCD) No I did not see it. Where is it?

(TR) Some of those editors even agreed, in that particular instance, that the present usage was incorrect. Those editors, however, cited sources to support their position rather than simply stating """"it's obviously incorrect"""". It appears that no consensus to change was reached as the article name remains unchanged. I have not seen one editor agree with you that there exists """"indiscriminate foreign language insinuations """". There may be individual instances that need to be addressed (with the proper sourcing and discussion), but, under the present guideline, I see no need for wholesale changes. There is no """"authority"""" on this project other than policy and consensus. If you wish a review of my position, you may contact any editor.

 Hcobb and NPOV redux 

See archive of previous discussion
I feel the need to revive the discussion of Hcobb's POV edits, especially with regards to the F-22 and F-35 articles. He has reinserted content that was previously removed because of question to its weight. Now, as the editor who initially removed that content, I'm open to discussion and defense of it should Hcobb wish to do so, but his edit summary on reinserting it was only """"Noting other shoe dropping."""" That is not a counter or a defense. When I removed his content again, he responded with his characteristic outlash on the talk page that made no attempt to connect his comments to the edits he is complaining about. He did so with a highly inflammatory thread title that was directly opposite to the claims made by his own source. I have since responded and renamed the thread title. On F-35, he continues his campaign of attacking edits on the subject, even so far as inserting content that, when he brought it up on the talk page, had little support and was directly questioned. Hcobb's response to make a joke at the expense of the article subject, and insert the content without actually addressing the comments made on the talk page.   """,0

preventative measures:
dependant upon control and elimination of the insect vector .
There is currently no artificial means of prevention.
Methods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where malaria is endemic, include prophylactic drugs, mosquito eradication, and the prevention of mosquito bites. There is currently no vaccine that will prevent malaria, but this is an active field of research.

Some drugs that can be used for treatment of malaria can also be used for its preventative qualities however they need to be taken daily or weekly. These are seldom used by those living in a malaria abundant enivornment and are commonyl found amongst travellers visitng regions of hight malaria activity.
Quinine was used starting in the seventeenth century as a prophylactic against malaria. The development of more effective alternatives such as quinacrine, chloroquine, and primaquine in the twentieth century reduced the reliance on quinine. Today, quinine is still used to treat chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum, as well as severe and cerebral stages of malaria, but is not generally for malaria prophylaxis.

Modern drugs used preventively include mefloquine (Lariam®), doxycycline (available generically), and atovaquone proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone®). The choice of which drug to use is usually driven by what drugs the parasites in the area are resistant to, as well as side-effects and other considerations. The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting taking the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and must continue taking them for 4 weeks after leaving (atovaquone proguanil only needs be started 2 days prior and continued for 7 days afterwards).

Controlling the vector is the most useful way of preventing the spread of malaria.
Efforts to eradicate malaria by eliminating mosquitoes have been successful in some areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but the draining of wetland breeding grounds and better sanitation, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from affluent regions. In 2002, there were 1,059 cases of malaria reported in the US, including eight deaths. In five of those cases, the disease was contracted in the United States. Malaria was eliminated from the northern parts of the USA in the early twentieth century, and the use of the pesticide DDT eliminated it from the South by 1951. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a major public health effort to eradicate malaria worldwide by selectively targeting mosquitoes in areas where malaria was rampant.[12] However, these efforts have so far failed to eradicate malaria in many parts of the developing world - the problem is most prevalent in Africa. The United States itself may face the spread of malaria in the future as climate change (warming) leads to an expansion of the areas in which mosquitoes are active..

Mosquito nets and prevention of mosquito bites

Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people, and thus greatly reduce the infection and transmission of malaria. The nets are not a perfect barrier, so they are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to search for a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets.[16] Since the Anopheles mosquitoes feed at night, the preferred method is to hang a large """"bed net"""" above the center of a bed such that it drapes down and covers the bed completely.

The distribution of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide (often permethrin) has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention. These nets can often be obtained for around US$2.50 - $3.50 (2-3 euros) from the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and others.

For maximum effectiveness, the nets should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months. This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas. A new type of impregnated net, called Olyset, releases insecticide for approximately 5 years[17], and costs about US$5.50. ITN's have the advantage of protecting people sleeping under the net and simultaneously killing mosquitoes that contact the net. This has the effect of killing the most dangerous mosquitoes. Some protection is also provided to others, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net.

Unfortunately, the cost of treating malaria is high relative to income, and the illness results in lost wages. C",0

The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. There's no way you can deny that, even if you believe that the label is undeserved, that the label could be pejorative in a non-encyclopedic context, or that somehow being categorized under """"homophobia"""" and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as """"homophobic organization."""" The categories """"homophobic organization"""" and """"homophobe"""" were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question. """"Homophobia"""" is not, and these false analogies may make it seem like we're out go get the AFA, but we aren't. Although Sam seems to think it's an irrelevant personal comment, it is the case, Hal, that since you got here, you've been arguing that the AFA's opinion of itself should more of a part of the article, and that criticism should not be. Miles have been spun about how much of a big deal this is, that we're gay activists, that we're creating attack articles, that the category homophobia is a pejorative attack on whatever it labels. Now, Sam, I know you'll insist on removing this part of my comment (editing/censoring others' comments is a practice that is, by the way, fairly dubious). But remember that we are supposed to discuss the issue at hand, not the character of others - I'm not attacking Hal's character. But his history of editing for the sake of the AFA is completely relevant to this discussion and a part of the issue at hand - it explains why he believes we've constructed an attack article (hardly), why the category is a pejorative attack or accusation (clearly not), and why it must be eventually removed. I agree with Hal: it could be taken as a pejorative, and what concerns me is that it is, but only (as far as I can tell) by someone who's made it clear that portraying the AFA in a positive light is very important (no matter [[WP:UNDUE|what that entails).

 Nothing personal 

Greetings Elitra, I just wanted to let you know my comments are nothing personal towards you or the other WMF folks but the release of VE with so many problems is premature and folks have a valid point that proper notification wasn't given. Please don't take the following as a negative reflection but I wanted to clarify a couple things. People are frustrated because now, as in the past, it seems as thought the WMF doesn't listen to what us editors are saying. Yes you have evidence that you tried to notify users but the way the notifications were done and the places they were located gives the impression that the folks building these changes don't understand the community or how it works. You are also worknig hard to fix the problems but then releae the app to all logged in users knowing there are a lot of problems, many of which are severe. Then you act as though your surprised and hurt that we are annoyed. We know you are working on the problems, but so are we and we want to feel as though our voices are heard too. When the Visual Editor talk pages aren't filled with long lists of complaints and bugs, then we can talk about a widescale release. But there's no need to rush it out yet. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that the problems aren't with you, they are with the WMF organizations's ongoing policy of doing whatever they feel like regardless of what us dumb editors think. Happy editing. PS, sorry they mixed us up.  

 Your user page 

Hi Elitre, when we designed the  template, we intended to make it easy for staff to use it and edit it, so added parameters that would make it easy to update the relevant sections. I noticed that you'd substituted the template on your user page instead of transcluding it and presumed this was not intentional, so I've gone ahead and boldly switched it to the template, making a few general fixes. This should allow you to also edit your user page through the Visual Editor. Please feel free to undo my changes if you intended to substitute the template! -) helpfulone 

 Random act of kindness 

 Hello Elitre (WMF), Eduemoni has given you a shining smiling star! You see, these things promote WikiLove and hopefully this has made your day better. Spread the  whether it be someone you have had disagreements with in the past or someone putting up with some stick at this time. Enjoy! ↑talk↓

RfC: Incompatibility between the standard scientific notation for paragroups, and links 

Standard scientific notation for paragroups is to use an asterisk after the name for the haplotype. The very conciseness which makes this a very useful standard, reduces its usefulness as a link
Therefore, currently, there is no standard for both noting a paragroup, and usefully linking to the paragroup article which explains this distinction, without saying, Haplotype paragroup, which in my limited understanding seems to be either a tautology or an oxymoron (I told you it was limited)
I fear my option may be marginally acceptable, and I was hoping someone with a better knowledge of the subject might either endorse them or have a better idea
Current status: * The current status. If you missed that, I can't say I am surprised, it is a link shown as * after the colon and before the word, """"The"""" on this line. Paragroups are marked with an asterisk, which is pipe-linked to the redirect page * (haplogroup), creating about 30 or so double redirects
Option: * paragroup My favorite. Might be better to use the abbreviation, 'para', instead, to save space.

Here's mine:
You call it my """"harassment campaign"""". I call it seeking a dispute resolution.I supported every statement in my RFC, filed at meta, with the differences. Since when seeking a dispute resolution is called """"harassment""""? May I please ask you to explain how come that  my RFC  that arbcom calls """"harassment"""" was not deleted at meta, that it was called a valid RFC by an admin on Meta, that another Meta admin stated: """"I think a substantive response to his or her allegations would be more valuable"""", that yet another Meta admin said to Gwen: """"it would be fine to see your response there""""? Also I am not sure I understand what """"specifics of my harassment"""" are you talking about. May I please ask you to list these """"specifics"""" here? Some differences would be nice too.
Yes, I was instructed to stop by arbcom, but I was never explained why should I stop, or rather I was told that I should stop because I am """"waging a vendetta against this administrator because of an ancient incident"""", which is incorrect. Any unbiased person would agree that there are real problems with Gwen Gale performance as sysop described in this section alone with at least one of them that happened just a few days ago. As a result of my research Gwen Gale was questioned about  two blocks she imposed.
Instead of reblocking me arbcom had to address the evidences presented in my RFC, which has never been done. I consider this dishonest not only towards me, but towards Gwen Gale as well.
Now about the reblock itself: 
Blocks are not punitive. Before this block I was blocked since July of 2011. My latest contribution to my talk were made 2 months ago, and I had absolutely no intentions to come back, so what this block suppose to prevent? Am I supposed to be so upset with the block that I would stop my fight for the victims of bullying? I got an impression that arbcom is afraid om my RFC and of addressing it. This block violates each and every basic blocking policy.I believe that with this block arbcom fell to a new low.

Hersfold, I have one more question for you please. You wrote: """"This block was based on the consensus of the Arbitration Committee"""". For transparency may I please ask you to post to my talk who voted for and against (if any) the reblock. IMO this will be an important piece of info that I see no reason not to disclose. 
I'd like  to thank arbcom for this reblock one more time. It demonstrated better than anything else that  RFC I filed on Meta was the right thing to do. Cheers.

Some text I removed/modified:
""""is a state that is composed of the island groups of Taiwan, the Pescadores, Kinmen, and Matsu."""" > """"is a state that currently has jurisdiction over the island groups of Taiwan, the Pescadores, Kinmen, and Matsu."""" This is inspired by the proposal above. The former adheres to Chenism and is POV. Whether the ROC=Taiwan is subject to debate. I don't see how the latter can be disputed.
""""Some people view the current ROC that exists on Taiwan as the continuation of the ROC state that from 1912 to 1949 exercised sovereignty over all of China. Others view the state on Taiwan as existing separately from Republican China."""" > """"From 1912 to 1949 the ROC encompassed all of China."""" Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words. who are these """"some people"""" and """"others""""? The sentence is too ambiguous to be useful. Again, I don't see how the latter shorter wording is POV or inaccurate. 
""""modern Republic of China"""" > """"existing Republic of China"""". """"existing"""" is less ambiguous than """"modern"""". when does """"modern"""" begin? It also smacks less against the PRC's version of events.
""""warlordism"""" > """"warlordism"""". why the dewikification? the link is relevant.
removed """"which had been reclaimed from Japan in 1945"""". this is not an article on Japan. space is limited. why does this belong in the lead? This is in the history section.
""""the KMT set up what it called a provisional capital in Taipei"""" > """"the KMT declared Taipei the provisional capital"""". the latter is much shorter. the POV of regarding Taipei a provisional capital is alleviated by using the word """"declare"""". The KMT declared. That is not disputed, even not by the PRC.
""""the Communists proclaimed the People's Republic of China and claimed to have succeeded the ROC as China and that the Nationalist government in Taiwan was an illegitimate representative of China."""" > """"the Communists proclaimed the People's Republic of China and claimed to have succeeded the ROC over all of China and that the ROC government in Taiwan was an illegitimate government."""" The PRC not only disputed the KMT as a representative of China in intl organizations and elsewhere. It disputed the very existence of the ROC and its very legitimacy. The former is misleading and wrong.
Removed """"While the tense standoff of the Cold War era has largely subsided"""". Text formerly here about battles is gone. this clause is no longer necessary
Removed """"on both sides of the Taiwan Strait"""". Redundant. It is contentious everywhere (in the realm of international relations etc). and this is too obvious since these are the two sides in contention.
Removed """"and one of the original five Security Council members"""". removed in the interests of brevity. keep this in the foreign relations section. a mention of the UN membership is enough.
""""Most major countries now recognize the PRC as having succeeded the ROC as the representative of China"""" > """"Most countries switched their recognition from the ROC to the PRC in the 1970s"""" The former is wrong. These countries have established formal relations of the PRC, but merely """"acknowledged"""" the PRC's claims over Taiwan. They have not """"recognized"""" Taiwan as a province of the PRC and conduct de facto relations, treating Taiwan as if it were seperate.
""""recognized by 25 countries"""" > """"recognized by 25 states"""" """"states"""" is more accurate.  """,0

Friedmans words are clearly quoted and clearly cited via the article linked to. A source you have removed for some reason. Do you have something to contribute from """"Blitzers side""""? Please, by all means include it. Is lack of something from """"Blitzers side"""" a reason to exclude citicism and delete a large chunk of the article? I dont think so. Unless you can actually defend your changes citing policy you will need to revert them. 

To clarify, yes, Near East Report is an AIPAC publication, as I said four days ago. Whether it was published by AIPAC in the 70s, I don't know, although it is likely. What we do know is that Blitzer started working for the JPost in 1973. He may very well have edited a version of """"Myths & Facts"""" in 1976, by the way, en edition of that book was published every two years. Plenty of journalists do outside work. Keep in mind that we are an encyclopedia. You need a reliable source thats says who he worked for and the dates. Pulling this information together from different primary sources is original research. You cannot quote somebody as calling Near East Report a """"propaganda sheet"""" any more than another editor can say """"Belfast is inhabited by """"drunken and violent"""" Irish people with the quote cited to Thomas Nast. You also can't cite three people attacking Blitzer's scholarship in Territory of Lies without any response from Blitzer or his supporters.  

Firstly, I wont respond to your silly example referring to where I live. Your racism is disgusting and reflects only on you but thats your problem.

Secondly, please dont further insult the intelligence of editors by implying that Near East Report was *possibly* published by someone else in 1970s. Blitzer edited the book ergo he worked for AIPAC, likewise he was editor of the weekly publication Near East Report into 1978. Source? The directoy listing showing his name listed as the responsible party at the weekly. He worked for them in 1976,77,78 regardless of whether you seek to portray that as """"outside work"""" or anything else. His name is on the front cover of the book as editor right? His name is listed in the weekly publication as editor right? Are those facts in dispute by you? 

Friedmans words are his own, you removed not only the quote whos inclusion you disagree with but all the other details. Fine, remove the quote, but removing everything else? Criticism of Blitzer does belong in the section detailing criticism. An automatic rebuttal isnt necessarily required if its a minority view and/or it cant be located.

Just to correct you, in america, hispanic and anglo are used as racial terms. Where do you come from that you don't recognize this? Again, just fo the record, europeans view non-white south americans as hispanic. Spaniards are not considered hispanic by european standards. 

And don't let these stupid americans fool you either! At one point, they considered jews and irish to be non-white, believe it or not. So, this speaks volumes of the ignorance of americans who don't even come close to europeans in culture, arts, language, science, fashion, etc.

"=The Signature of the Atomic Bomb
There are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of Japan, marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per 27 October 2010, or 19 Dhu al-Qidah 1431, or 19 Heshavan 5771. Butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. Except from this, it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. First. Art by artists working both before the World War II, during and after, can not necessarily be defined as more, or less, contemporary because of this timestamp. Contemporary art did explicitly exist also before World War II, as this label - contemporary - has been expressed as a mark of quality, pertaining especially to modernism, by art carrying an ideal summoning, from the artist or his genius, making some kind of composed expression of what, in such case, are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time, reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world, in the event of the art-making process including its publication or presentation. Another trickster is, for me, that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. It is absurd as a Norwegian to not consider Henrik Ibsen a maker of contemporary art. His plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. I sincerly believe that Henrik Ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed, or may I say be transported by the unfolding of time. The retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century. I think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.",0

Let's put it this way Flo, everyone has talked past me here for months. It is absolutely frustrating to have everything I contribute get labeled as """"disruptive."""" Disruptive, how? Tedentious, how? I sure as heck don't feel that I have done so because as far as I'm concerned I've acted in good faith trying to make Wikipedia the best it can be.

If you want to explain the rules to me and how I can be who I am on Wikipedia and stay within the rules, I'm all ears. I just want FM to leave me alone. How would you feel if you were new on a site and everything you did was declared illegal by people who disagree with you when there is a pretence to neutrality without any explanation?

If you have done such a good job explaining everything to me, then why do I feel that I've been ganged up on without just cause? I know a lot of people who feel that Wikipedia has a definite bias when it comes to politics and religion that's not very positive.

Why not listen to me? What do you all have to lose? My faith is the core of my being, and it's who I am. Do you expect me to junk my worldview to contribute to Wikipedia? Have any of you stopped to consider how your own worldviews contributes to how you interpret the rules?

Do you care how ordinary readers view Wikipedia? You probably do, or else you wouldn't be here. The fact is traditionally minded Christians number over 1 billion people on this planet, and close to 100 million in the United States alone. That's not some tiny crackpot minority out there. If I feel attacked by Wikipedia, or feel that my POV is misrepresented, how do you think they feel reading Wikipedia?

Let's face it here, factually, the perspective represented in the articles in the Dominionism series, from my perspective, seem to overemphasize the views of a small minority in the United States regarding the Christian Right. 

Why should my work be reversed when I elaborate on the Dominionist's POV, which BTW, I don't agree with, for the sake of ensuring fairness. Or when FM, removes something I wrote from a reputable Evangelical ministry critical of Christian Reconstructionist theology? He tells me it's false or that I'm POV pushing. HOW? I cited the sources, which are widely respected in Evangelical circles.

What am I supposed to think when 2/3s of the article is devoted to the opponents of the Christian Right, who by the way are a minority of the total American population. Bush won twice because of their support and elected the GOP to Congress and a majority of the statehouses. 

Katherine Yurica's and TheocracyWatch's POV represents a MINORITY of the population. I have no idea where you live. Perhaps their perspectives are popular among your friends, but they don't represent the larger picture. How is writing from the majority perspective POV pushing or giving undue weight to my perspective, considering it's the perspective of just a little over 50 percent of the American population.

I suggested banning partisanship as part of the NPOV rule and Consensus rule, but FeloniousMonk reverted my changes that had been made by a previous editor. When he does that, what am I supposed to think about his motives? I don't know him, and he hasn't exactly been the most friendly person to me since day one. 

Have you ever stopped to think, it's not what you say, but how you say it? The tone from yourself and the other admins has kept me on the defensive, and what am I supposed to think, other than what I've said ad nauseam? I feel attacked, not consulted with.

So far, I feel that no one has explained anything about their perspectives to me except for what comes across on my screen in my mind as person attack. Things like WP:POV, WP:POINT etc., that get put up when I feel that I have done nothing wrong comes across as a personal attack instead of.

Could you consider rephrasing it this way, or this is how you should be doing this. That's constructive in my view. 

Instead of hurling rules at me, the interpretations of which I disagree with, tell me why you think I stepped over the line and your rationale. I react positively to reasoned explanations, not summary reversals of my work, accusations of POV pushing, etc., without explanation.

Maybe you've been at this for awhile, so you take things for granted. I simply go to the rulebook and fail to see where all of you are getting your opinions from. Interpretation my friend. I want to understand your interpretation, and why you interpret the rules the way you do.

Every time I do anything, from asking people what they think about the rules, or my ideas for improving Wikipedia, I get written up on this RfC. Flo, please don't take this personally,

Berkshires,

Perhaps you say that you agree with the quoted statement, but you don't seem to get it.

Yes it is true that the Beth Din will not/didn't decide who is or should be a Rebbe to whom. They never took that power to themselves nor can I imagine that such power can even be granted. But of course they were granted the power to decide who is the """"Bobover Rebbe"""", who can use the name Bobov.

Berkshires this is an obvious distinction, one that I previously thought you were faking ignorance of. I now realise that you may have very well been serious. I will therefore try to explain it in more detail.

Think for a moment, if Rabbi Halberstam should decide tommorow that he no longer wants the title Bobover Rebbe, he no longer wants he Kehilla to be named Bobov, but rather some name of some other polish town. Does that render him no longer Rebbe to his Chasidim? The connection between a Rebbe and a Chossid has absolutley nothing to do with his title.

There was a dispute in Bobov over assets, over the title, and over usage of the name Bobov and other names used by Bobov. A very simple dry Din Torah. The Beth din  gave to Rabbi Halberstam side all of Bobov assets, the rights to the title, the name Bobov, and all other names used by Bobov. That does not mean that Rabbi Unger isn't a Rebbe? It doesn't even mean that he isn't a """"mamshich"""" of his father-in-law or grandfather-in-law. The same way the first Bobover Ruv did not have the title Sanzer ruv but he was still a """"mamshich"""" of Sanzer Ruv.

Try to remove your emotions and be impartial and you may even understand the Beth Din's logic. I am not saying you need to agree, but perhpas if you stand back for a moment you can understand their decision.

Putting aside all claims and counter claims as to who should have been selcted as the Rebbe of Bobov, I know you must believe that the son-in-law should have been selected, however there is almost unanimous consent between all Poskim that the will of the majority is respected. The Beth Din made a clear finding within the Psak that Side 2 had a majority.

If you follow that logic the Psak is self explanatory. You have a Kehilla. They made a decision as to their Rav and Rebbe. A minority is unhappy. They leave. Can they get a part of the assets? Can they use the name and title? The Beth Din answered that question with its ruling.

I went long here only because I feel a sort of denialist anger simmering within your writting, and I don't think it is warranted. I thought perhaps you can follow the logic.

In any event the Beth din did make a decsion who has and can use the title Bobover Rebbe. Rabbi Unger can no longer refer to himself as Bobover Rebbe. 

It would be appropriate for you to give this a rest.  """,0

There may be more concise ways to write it, but removing all mention of NKR is not an improvement. Something that read as quite puffery was the UN paragraph. It's not remotely unusual for a country to be part of the UN, and it's not particularly special to be elected to the UNSC. The four paragraphs 'rule' is a guide to try and create a concise lead.

I have to say, I think further splitting of the articles will only create an even more confusing array of definitions for readers. Perhaps we should think about reformatting the above articles into a more reasonable arrangement. The article Technocracy used to be a lot bigger and gave more info on the different groups and definitions of the term, but it was recently trimmed down to something very small, (which I was against doing BTW). So to start from the beginning, we have the word Technocracy, which has acquired many different meanings, one meaning being a Bureaucratic oligarchy of Scientists, this is addressed in the Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory) articles and isn't really relevant here. The other meaning, the one we are concerned with here is that used by the Technical Alliance and Tech Inc. and subsequently adopted by several other groups in 1930's. Then NET, which was essentially a direct branching from Tech Inc., just in Europe, but has adopted it's own ideas, some of which are different to Tech Inc's. I don't really know what is the best way to proceed yet, but I don't think anything should be split or deleted without a lot more discussion.",0

 Archiving deleted gay material 

It has been suggested the two are gay or suffering from gender confusion. Rod stated in 'Tis the Fifteenth Season he was jealous of girls because they get to wear dresses. In Bart to the Future, an episode depicting the future, Ned thanks Bart for not outing Rod and Todd who are shown bare-chested washing a cabinet in a slightly feminine way whilst wearing tight denim cut-off shorts and sporting mustaches, known as the Castro clone style fashionable in gay culture in the 1980s and popularized by Freddie Mercury.
Rod and Todd are both extremely sheltered from girls as their father consider girls to be a temptation along with rock and roll music. In another future-set episode, """"Future-Drama"""" Bart's girlfriend mentions she wants to make love to him on prom night, and becomes disappointed when he denies her. She says, """"I never had this problem with Todd Flanders!"""", implying a strong, though latent, sexuality in the boy.

 Cybercopyedit, Optics, Alhazen, etc. 

Hi. About Cybercopyedit's changes to Optics: This isn't sockpuppetry. I complained that his previous username did not comply with policy and he handled it by creating a new one, which is one of the recommended ways to deal with that problem. 

I think he may have a valid point about Alhazen's book. The article's previous statement that the book merely """"documented the then-current understanding of vision"""" does not appear to be supported by the reference that was already cited in the article. I took a quick skim through the parts of it that are freely accessible earlier today, and it appeared to show that Alhazen's work significantly expanded on the previous understanding of the subject. Based on that one reference (not contributed by Cybercopyedit as far as I know), it appears that a stronger statement of Alhazen's contribution is warranted.

Could you take a look at this colloquoy?
Do you concur that conflating Yakup with Yakub was original research?

FWIW I believe this is the first exchange I have ever had with this administrator.

Thanks!  —

"""

Harald88, you are mixing up everything again like an autodidact, and you don't want to listen. You know once again  everything in advance and much better than anybody else. What you are stating here, however, is nonsense again. The classical forerunner of SRT has been  optics of moving bodies, a discipline dealing with the observation of  point source from a moving platform, which is governed by Bradley's law of velocity aberration. A point source emits spherical waves, not plane waves.

In none of the references stated in the nonsensible Wikipedia article on the transverse Doppler effect, to which you have contributed, a proof is delivered, but it is simply asserted there that the transverse Doppler effect has been unknown in classical physics. In dozens of textbooks this nonsense is repeated without proof because authors tend to write off from one another.

'Proofs' of the nonsense are delivered in Chapter 11 of J. D. Jackson's book on clsssical electrodynamics as well as in a German book on SRT by Greiner/Rafelski who probably have copied the 'deduction' offered in Jackson's book (who himself probably got that 'deduction' from somewhere else). These 'deductions' boil down to direct betrayal of naive students, because the students are made to believe that a point source, such as a fixed star, does emit plane waves rather than spherical waves. Nobody tells them that the plane wave approximation is only an approximation and that it is, therefore, completely useless to 'prove' something ia a context of paramount importance. 

The nonsense of the 'non-existing classical Doppler effect' spreads in the literature since Einstein published in 1907 a short note, where he had stated that the transverse Doppler effect, which already Stark wanted to measure (why, if it is unknown in classical optics of moving bodies?), is """"important"""", but not that it is """"unknown"""" in classical physics. It apparently has to do with the hystery which seems to capture most people who get in touch
with the special relativity nonsense.

In reality SRT departs from classical optics of moving bodies solely for the case of longitudinal observation.

This I was going to demonstrate in the article Modern Galilean relativity.

Because of your unprofessional interference with that article I stopped today contributing to it.

Since you have the big mouth and know everything better, I suggest that you finish the article

 Naji al-Ali 

Hi Ian,

I noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to 1938. What is your source for that? I'm wondering because the Arabic wikipedia article, which this page started as a translation from, cites his year of birth as 1937, while a book I have about him - the one referenced in the article - cites it as 1936. What the book says in a footnote on the subject is """"Sulaiman al-Shaikh - """"The caricature artist Naji al-Ali"""" - in the Kuwaiti magazine al-`Arabi, no. 297, August 1983. Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection."""" While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son.

On the other hand, on this page Naji al`Ali himself is quoted as saying """"I was born where Christ was born: between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of al-Shahra in the northern Galilee, and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to `Ain al-Hilwe camp in Lebanon.""""

However, the same site also bases its short biography of Naji al-`Ali on the book I used, and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly.

Unless you have a solid source, I think we may have to leave it as unknown.

By the way, that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination, I wonder could we get permission to use it...

"The following policy is given in Wikipedia:Verifiability: ‘articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy’. On the other hand Wikipedia:No original research states ‘Examples of primary sources include... ...original philosophical works...’ and ‘Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation’ it also states at the end of the paragraph ‘Appropriate sourcing is a complicated issue, and these are general rules. The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’
The above enables me to derive some conclusions: 
What is mend by “third-party sources” (WP:V) is not exactly the same as “Tertiary sources” (NOR). If the policies do refer to the same they contradict each other, which probably is not the case. I think “third-party sources” are, placed in context, ‘other sources than Wikipedia itself and its editors’; this would make sense, given what follows directly after the line containing “third-party sources”: ‘Reliable sources are necessary [...] to substantiate material within articles...’
Vassyana said ‘Reliance on Rand directly is a NPOV concern...’ it is now clear that it is of no concern at all. Yes ‘an interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source’ but when the text of the citation speaks for itself no further interpretation is required. She also said ‘there is absolutely no need to rely heavily in any way on the primary material’ which is still argued, in contrast I say there is absolutely no reason not to rely heavily on the primary material.
The arguments pro primary source material have, as of yet, not been given a response; the focus was on the demand to have (mainly) third-party sources. In the proper context primary sources are third-party sources, fulfilling the demand. Again ‘The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’ Let’s now focus on that.",0

A certain user has deleted correct information and posted politically biased information in this article.

These are all in the first three paragraphs on the history of the town. 

Paragraph 1.
The original town name of Middletown was spelled """"Mattabeseck"""", this can be seen in the records of the general Assembly of Connecticut, which were QUOTED in this article until the ignorant and unscrupulous poster deleted the reference. This is significant in that southwestern Algonquin was spoken with a much harder inflection on the consonants, -and Mattabeseck is a southwestern Algonquin town.

Paragraph 2.
Quotations about Puritan life in general are irrelevant in this article. 

Paragraph 3.
William Cronin is not a reliable source for local detail in Connecticut. Cronin's highly inflammatory accounts of the history of the settlement of America is very controversial, and has been shown to be very factually inaccurate and unreliable. It was very popular as a piece of political argument, and very poor historical scholarship.

That this article MUST include this kind of erroneous detail is unfortunate. That the systems and procedures that define Wikipedia are not able to withstand this kind of assault from the politically-minded and ignorant marks the limitation of Wikipedia's usefulness.

Notability of Dieagram
 A tag has been placed on Dieagram requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  Blanchardb-•MyEars•MyMouth-timed """,0

 see http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html exposing Wikipedia's lying liars & their lies 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and Sou",0

4 I will not be silent concerning him Or the praise of his martial exploits -Meaning in Hebrew Uncertain- 

5 Who can uncover his outer garment? Who can penetrate the folds of his Jowls? 

6 Who can pry open the doors of his face? His bared teeth strike terror. 

7 His protective scales are his pride, Locked with a binding seal. 

8 One scale touches the other; Not even a breath can enter between them. 

9 Each clings to each; They are interlocked so they cannot be parted. 

10 His sneezings flash lightning, and his eyes are like the glimmerings of dawn. 

11 Firebrands stream from his mouth; Fiery sparks escape. 

12 Out of his nostrils come smoke As from a steaming, boiling cauldron. 

13 His breath ignites coals; Flames blaze from his mouth. 

14 Strength resides in his neck; Power leaps before him. 

15 The layers of his flesh stick together; He is as though cast hard; he does not totter. 

16 His heart is cast hard as a stone, Hard as the nether millstone. 

17 Divine beings are in dread as he rears up; As he crashes down, they cringe. 

18 No sword that overtakes him can prevail, Nor spear, nor missile, nor lance. 

19 He regards iron as straw, Bronze, as rotted wood. 

20 No arrow can put him to flight; Slingstones turn into stubble for him. 

21 Clubs are regarded as stubble; He scoffs at the quivering javelin 

22 His underpart is jagged shards; It spreads a threshing-sledge on the mud. 

23 He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; He makes the sea boil like an ointment-pot. 

24 His wake is a luminous path; He makes the deep seem white-haired. 

25 There is no one on land who can dominate him, Made as he is without fear.

I removed the (big soup) claim at the top of the article and revised the Etymology section.  Minestra is Italian for soup and -one is an augmentative suffix.  It could be translated as """"big soup,"""" but that is perhaps too literal.  In any case, saying that it means """"big soup"""" does not aid understanding, but rather confuses.  Why is it big?  Is it made in large quantities?  Are the vegetables big?  And so on.  It is sufficient to say that minestra means soup and -one is an augmentative suffix.
Under Etymology, I made changes to improve conciseness.  It is not necessary to cite every etymologically related word (i.e., """"minister"""" and """"minus""""); in fact, doing so clearly caused confusion since an editor in the History section of this article refers the reader to the Etymology section for the 14th c. appearance of minestrone.  Quite apart from being OR (that's another copy-edit) it is incorrect; the 14th c. is when the verb """"to minister"""" appeared in English.

Kurdistan?

Kurdistan is not a geo-political region. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iraq. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iran. There's no region called Kurdistan in Turkey. That's akin to placing an Algeristan in France, and making an article that treats it like a country. There are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force.

 The precise definition of race is under dispute.. 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.""",0

But anthropogenic global warming certainly is, and this is probably one of the aspects of scientific consensus that stands in greatest contradiction to popular belief. The vast majority of ordinary people display no detectable concern about continuing to burn fossil fuels, and a sizable fraction either deny that burning fossil fuels can possibly influence the climate, or doubt that the influence would be harmful.

Well I might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to WP:DBAD (here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit -) ), as I consider you had pointed me (  ;-)  ), but that still hasn't given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page (here I mean the Talk:International recognition of Kosovo page). As far as the WP:RM (if this is what you had in mind) is concerned, my opinion is that the third conversator  thinks other of the procedure (I'm still not sure that there is one). Moreover, I'm certain that for the time being he doesn't think of another POV of the """"procedure"""", because of this words of his, which are somehow unclear (at least to me): """"Any new proposals will be speedy closed. Persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the WP:ARBMAC probation this article is under the scope of."""" concerning the closure of """"proposal"""". I'm not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of International recognition of Kosovo (""""IroK"""") or through the WP:RM. Actually, I find WP:RM somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. I've tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at WP:RM, but then I might misunderstood something. I might consider asking for explanation on the very own project's page, as for that matter. Hus, as a formalist as I consider you at the moment, I must ask you now this: when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. I suppose I pointed out ( one might consider I've used irony, I apologize to those) to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure, since the very procedure hasn't been tagged as a guideline, but still named a project, to the least. Maybe, some other place exists, which I'm not aware of - I apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner, since I've been passive and not searching for potential one myself. Not to mention judgemental and still non-constructive enough, to contribute myself (although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action -? -/ ). Sorry for that.
Ijanderson977, you asked: Why are you not claiming that this article has a POV title: International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia? Well, actually, I do consider this title is biased also. But personally I consider the """"IroK"""" more globally important, not just to me, as one might think it is. If the bias is dealt with this issue (IroK title), it could be dealt elsewhere also. And IMHO it is good to keep the discussion in one place -> maybe creating a new page, where this discussion concerning the term """"recognition"""" (or more) could be taken, should be considered as an idea.

Hi Bishonen, 

Actually, the """"wink-wink, you know exactly what I'm talking about"""" was directed to Jossi, not you.  My questions to you were about the other quotes of Rawats.  I'm very discouraged to hear you say that you find them too ambiguous to know just who he was talking about.  He was Guru Maharaj Ji.  He was the Perfect Master.  He Was God incarnated, Saviour of Mankind and so on.  In fact, Jossi still thinks he's all of that.  If you would please spend just a little time reading the section of EPO or the Gallery of quotes I linked you to earlier, you'd see this in spades.

Anyway, Jossi is a liar through and through.  He knows full well that Rawat was referring to himself. I mean, really, who else do you think he might have been talking about?

I'm very, very frustrated as you can tell.  I'm a lawyer.  Words and logic are my stock in trade.  Plus I was in this stupid cult for years.  I know it inside out.

 Controversial Cupboard 

I have very little time left now for major work here so I propose making a subsection of this, my talk page, since it's getting a teency weency bit long now. (171 kilobytes)

The first cupboard will be entitled """"Irish Terrorism/Politics"""" and I propose moving whole sections of my talk page into it - if there are no vehement and persuasive objections. I'll keep the same chronological order, but these are the sections I plan on moving in their entirety:- 
    * 7 Stop canvassing!
    * 8 Gaimhreadhan
    * 9 Sockpuppetry block
    * 10 Unblocked
    * 17 Result of PIRA investigation
    * 20 Jean McConville
    * 21 You have been blocked
    * 28 Trim
    * 29 User talk:Tyrenius
    * 38 Blocked
    * 39 Gaimhreadhan's Block
    * 40 Your post on my talk page
    * 41 Legal threat
    * 46 Block
          o 46.1 Infallibility
    * 48 Block reduced

I estimate that this """"housekeeping""""/censorship will reduce this page's size by more than 65% and make it more manageable for those of readers who use dial up modems and/or are moaning.

I realise that some of these sections are not wholly concerned with """"Irish Terrorism/Politics"""" but all have comments that could be categorised as such and I did not wish to separate comment and riposte, in so far as that is practically possible....Gaimhreadhan (kiwiexile at DMOZ) talk  • """,0

Yes, you were being uncivil to me by assuming that I said """"because I want it in."""" I never said that. That's how morons think, and hence this description for you. Your tone has been at least as combative as you think mine has, so you are the one who needs to calm down. Wikipedia editing actually isn't for you.
You obviously don't know quite how 3RR works. If someone reverts more than 3 times in the same day's worth of time, then they have broken 3RR. Not until then.
You guys may not be on the same exact team, but you claim """"consensus"""" despite that I'm not part of that as one of the editors in the dispute. You still have not answered why you guys in that supposed """"consensus"""" have gone deeper than you were already satisfied with before. Perhaps I should ask the one who is doing it most recently, fakesmile. In fact, even he or she is edit-warring now. Just because s/he's part of your consensus doesn't mean s/he's not edit-warring. So there's that issue too.

Okay, , when you first started your reversion junk here, even you would only revert to the point of where escape orbit left the """"(stylized as 'ebay')"""" in place without the old version. Go back up and look at his bullets here and then look at your reversions. All of you who were doing those early reversions in your little group that you called """"consensus"""" were originally only reverting to the point of leaving the mention of the current style in the lead, according to the earlier discussion here. Originally you guys were only saying that mentioning the former style in the lead was """"too much"""" for you, so you didn't erase them both. Why are you guys erasing them both now, even though the original concern was only against the old' one?

While I am somewhat dissapointed by D'Adamo's lack of footnotes, and frustrated by his avoidance of indexes, I haven't yet found a credible direct dispute to any significant claims of his. I am aware of a text that might indicate behavior of lectins on stomach tissuus would need to be directly studied, but I wasn't willing to spend in excess of $200 US (iirc) to find out what exactly it found, depite it being a """"real"""" scientificly strict (apparently, as I didn't actually get to read the) study. 
While not as rigourously strict with the science as it should be (at least what is presented in his books) ER4YT doesn't seem to be significantly paranormal or disprovable. So while it has a stigma of pseudoscience, that stigma hasn't really been justified.  Some supposed refutation I have come across turned out to be of even poorer quality, either reflecting it's own pseudoscience, or a lack of familiarity with the nominal subject. I would really like to see some explicit, maybe even rigorous debunking of D'Adamo's (occasionaly controversial? I can't see why) offerings. As of yet, I consider this closer to protoscience than unfalsifiable pseudoscience. 
In any case, I don't think that anything I previously posted on this matter is all that fantastic.  Is the mere mention of Doctor D'Adamo, or Eat Right For Your Type (ER4YT) enough to invalidate the respose I offered?  Other than that vague stigma, is my above answer to the utility of divergent blood types unhelpful or incorrect? I do believe that I was careful enough to avoid anything that wasn't NPOV.

24.243.187.152 has committed a mild amount of vandalism on The Andy Milonakis Show. It appears that he was attempting to make a joke, but after other users have reverted him, I left him a vandalism warning. He has only made one vandalistic edit since then.

"Truth is I'm not as convinced as Livingston is that Arnold so easily believed in a transcendent God.  Nonetheless, this statement from a notable scholar (not to mention those of Ruth apRoberts) should make us stop short of a strong pronouncement one way or the other.  The eminent scholars are in a quandary on this one (and I am quite reticent to place myself in any category of eminence on this matter), surely their quandary is reason enough for us to look at least for some more qualified statement, and I mean to include by that my own substitute which no doubt also lacked sufficient qualification.

I cannot lay my hands on it just now, but Arnold does say at one point, somewhat defensively, that he believes in God.  I think the problem is that Arnold's beliefs are not really so easily categorizable.  He makes it clear that Spinoza's thoughts appeal to him.  He also clearly states that he believes Spinoza was mis-judged in his time in being declared a heretic.  Part of our problem here might be that today we are so divorced from these older discussions of religion that we only see two alternatives: the belief in a transcendent, historical God, a God with physical attrributes; or no belief in God or anything that even remotely smacks of the metaphysical.  Our only possibility for a middle ground today may well be agnosticism (although, on a personal note, my own beliefs fall into the middle ground, and I would be insulted if anyone ever called me an agnostic, that however is not an argument that should have any relevance for the case with Arnold).  Arnold, I suspect, was quite comfortable dismissing superstition and setting aside metaphysical concerns, while still believeing in God.  The physicality or metaphysicality of that God were not relevant to the virtue they brought to Arnold and to his society.  In his own time he was accused of wanting to eat his cake and take it, too.  But he held out, and to my knowledge mever admitted the doubts that are implicit in agnosticism.

In other words, I think with Arnold, Livingston overstates the case for him, he is not at the center of Protestant thought; Arnold really belongs to a middle ground that is more concerned with the poetry of relgion and its virtues and values for society.  But to call him an agnostic probably places him in an aspect of the middle ground that he would never have felt comfortable inhabiting.  Sorry to offer no quotations.  Let me see what I can find and get back with you.",0

More on guarnello
""""GUARNELLO (M/F). Both a kind of linen or cotton textile, and the feminine garment constructed from such a fabric.... The guarnello, rascia or saia is the standard form of dress for angels. It is worn by children as a simple, washable garment, and possibly also by pregnant women. There are also examples of guarnelli listed under items of male clothing."""" - Dress in Renaissance Italy, 1400-1500, by Jacqueline Herald, Humanities Press: NJ, 1981, quoted here

The coarse overdress for working women definition is from The World of Renaissance Florence by Francesco Adorno, Translated by W. Darwell, Giunti, 1999, ISBN 8809013492.
page 80

This site says:
A loose, sheer overdress (worn over a regular dress), was used at home and after birth - hence very few depictions of such garbs exist. Some has argued that it is not too unlike the sheer chemise like garbs Botticelli's """"Three graces"""" wears in his """"Primavera"""", but it can also be seen in his portrait of """"Smeralda Brandini"""" in London.

That may also be following Herald, which is listed as one of the sources.

The fabric is also translated as """"fustian"""" which would seem to be the coarser variety.

And here's the kicker: An article in the Globe and Mail (quoted with the crucial next line here) says
Mona Lisa had recently given birth to a baby, a team of Canadian and French scientists announced Tuesday, so her mysterious smile may have expressed the weary joy of a mother with a newborn. Using infrared technology that allowed them to see beneath a layer of varnish, the researchers found that Leonardo da Vinci's model had a gauzy layer over her dress they say was typically worn by pregnant women of the time, or mothers who had recently given birth. The filmy robe was called a guarnello.

"Sails as wings? 

I think that this might be an oversimplification of the matter, as it depends largely on both the type of rigging being used and the direction (relevant to the wind direction) that one wishs to go.

For instance, many of the large square rigged ships did move essentially through the force of the wind pushing on the sail. I suppose technically the wind is piling up behind the sail (thus high pressure area) and the difference in pressure between the higher and lower pressure areas on opposite sides of the sail causes it to move, which is the same principle as that which generates lift. However, unlike in the case of aerofoils (aka wings) there is *not* a higher wind speed going across the back of the sail than the front.

In short, while the pressure differential as cause of movement remains valid, the cause of these pressure differences is not the same as for wings.

Lift (force)

Anyway, hope this helps.

 Orlady has followed my edits and repeatedly made probably dozens of accusations, that I am asserting personality defects in others.  That is false, I believe.  The accusation seems like many others Orlady has made, which are arguably personal attacks.  I don't know what she is referring to, about the personality defects.  It adds up to her ascribing a personality defect to me, that I am a person who ascribes defective personalities.  Should Orlady be blocked?

What has been under discussion at wt:CONN has been churning of articles, both of vandalism and of reversions by experienced editors (addressing vandalism and also enforcing unfair/unexplained standards for keeping some unsourced info but disallowing new editors' contributions of same).  I have at times referred to long patterns of edits, after disagreeing with many specific edits.  I do eventually perceive really obvious patterns, like that Orlady is following my edits and finding fault.  That is true;  Orlady does not deny it.  It is nonsensical to prohibit my mentioning that.  It is a statement about the edits, plural.  In the edit that SarekOfVulcan mentions, I term one specific edit """"silly"""" (in challenging whether an NRHP-listed district is NRHP-listed) but I do not call Orlady that term.  Whatever Orlady is asserting I have done, she has done more of towards me.

I don't actually understand the standard SarekOfVulcan is applying with this block.  I don't understand a distinction that can be made about my edits, which would not apply more strongly for Orlady for example.  I have discussed Orlady's edits and she has discussed mine.  SarekOfVulcan seems to be applying some standard about """"discuss edits not editors"""", which is overall probably good guidance for wikipedia.  But, when I become aware of an editor repeatedly, i.e. hundreds of times, engaging in a behavior, and i describe that behavior as a pattern of edits, I do not think that is prohibited.  It is not helpful to prohibit that.

Note, Orlady has refused mediation previously and has chosen not to answer repeated questions whether she would engage in mediation now.  Above she complains that I did not reply about a private email.  It is a worse offense not to reply to on-line request to engage in mediation.

 About Corticopia 

Corticopia's past 

Hello:

I just want to share with you some information you might consider important. We had a very difficult time months ago removing Mexico from Central America in the article North America. Why? Because an """"anonimous"""" user (IP from Toronto Canada) was reverting all the changes. I finally discovered he was an already registered user and got him blocked because of sockpuppetry. One month later, I found out he was already been accused of sockpuppetry with that account.

Well my point is that he is against of Mexico being included in North America. His main """"argument"""" was that the UN geosheme includes Mexico in CA and that's it. He also denies that North America is also a subregion of America and ignores the cited content proving him wrong. Well, he is Corticopia. For months he was retired and trust me, NO BODY changed the articles North America and Central America (specially this one) to say Mexico was in CA.

Suddenly a """"new"""" user shows up. He deleted a line in the article CA. It said """"Mexico is rarely, yet sometimes included in Central America under certain definitions"""". This line was discussed and agreed. He changed it to """"Mexico is included in Central America"""" then to """"Mexico is sometimes included in Central America"""".

I don't know what his problem is. The important thing is I totally felt this is the same person we had a very serious vandalism problems months ago, so I checked his edit list. Wow! What a discovery, his first edit was the article Issac Asimov and articles about Canada and some other regions of the world. It was very obvious it was the same person. Please check this sources  and this . Please, read them carefully.

Please check the contributions of each accused sockpuppetry account, specially the one of User:Ex post factoid. It is very obvious he is the same person.

He was dragged into the article Mexico when he was unable to """"win"""" again in the article Central America (he didn't even try to change the article North America because he knows a lot of people guard that article). So his reason to say Mexico is in """"Southern North America"""" are purely false and personal. He wants to """"exclude"""" Mexico or make it """"look"""" appart from Canda and the USA.

I'm telling you this because I think you don't realize his reasons are just personal, a personal aversion against Mexico being included in North America. If he's so interested in accuracy of the articles, why isn't he editing the article USA? He even asked Supaman to do it by himself. He's just there to exclude Mexico. Please read carefully the evidence provided in each sockpuppetry case. You said that you're an administrator in Spanish Wikipedia, so I think you're experienced in these cases. You will find it is the same person. Cortiopia has edited the same pattern of articles that the other accounts did. Too bad I warned him and I'm sure he stopped editing with that account to prevent being identified. I think we should stop him and prevent him from editing the article with his biased, excluding information, even if sourced, because his reasons are just personal and not for the sake of accuracy.

Holliday shot several people, but succeeded in killing just one man in a gunfight that we know of, and that was with a shotgun. Holliday's pistolship might have been more fast than deadly. Of Ringo's gunmanship we know next to nothing, except that he was certainly willing to shoot men who couldn't shoot back, and once threatened to have a real gunfight with Holliday. This was prevented, however, so we'll never know how it would have ended. Personally, I wonder how """"serious"""" a challenge to a gunfight in front of the city marshal was, in the case of both Ringo AND Holliday.

 Spastic Cerebral Palsy 

 Discovery 
Cerebral Palsy was first discovered, and medically defined in 1861 by Dr. William John Little. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/history-and-origin-of-cerebral-palsy/. 

Little attributed the disease to a lack of oxygen to an infant during """"abnormal forms of labor"""" resulting in a spastic condition. His work on the disease was so groundbreaking that it was first known as Little's Disease. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/history-and-origin-of-cerebral-palsy/.

 Definition 
Cerebral palsy is a disease that effects the brain and nervous system. The disease can be divided into various subsets, including spastic cerebral palsy, dyskinetic cerebral palsy, ataxic cerebral palsy, hypotonic cerebral palsy, and mixed. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001734/

Spastic Cerebral Palsy is the most common form of this disease. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001734/. It is distinguishable from other forms of Cerebral Palsy in that sufferers display stiff, jerky movements, and have hypertonic muscles. http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/spastic%20cerebral%20palsy This differs from Non-Spastic cerebral palsy, which causes decreased, or fluctuating muscle tone. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/types/#cm

Spastic Cerebral Palsy can itself be divided into unique categories.
 Spastic hemipelegia
Only one side of the body is effected in spastic hemipelgia. 
Spastic dipelgia
2 limbs are effected in Spastic dipelgia. 
Spastic triplegia
3 limbs are effected in Spastic diplegia.
Spastic quadripelgia
All 4 limbs are effected in Spastic quadriplegia.

Yes it may have been an independent entity at some point in time however it never was of much signifigance. It was always subjecated to a more powerful empire. Aramaean scribes in the Assyrian empire were always picture alongside Akkadian scribes. That at least points to the fact that they lived alongside each other and just as with Sumerian and Akkadian society merging to form classic Babylonian society the same happened of Akkadian/Assyrian society. In fact Assyria started as a Babylonian colony. Assyrian people today may very well call themselves Babylonian if they wished for that is the original established seat of the crown starting with the unification of Sumer and Akkad under Sargon of Akkad even though he ruled from Agade, the seat was moved to the holy city of the Gate of God. The official title of the king of Babylonia is """"Sar Mat Sumeri u Akkadi"""" which meant king of Sumer and Akkad which was the title of Sargon.

Well, let's try again (one more time).
Re """"""""commonsenual"""" = WP:OR. Regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation (Glantz et al.)"""" """"Commonsensual"""" is not OR. Occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete, and it is regulated by various international conventions. For instance, Guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation, and one of them refers to something quite unique. Therefore, we can speak about the """"occupation sensu stricto"""" and """"occupation following an armistice"""". That is what I mean under """"commonsensual"""" occupation, and that is how a reader will understand it.
Re belligerent occupation, I do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way; however, other sources (majority of sources) use different terminology. Therefore, the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. I propose to present both viewpoints - you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. Therefore, it is your arguments that do not hold water.
Re Malksoo, please, re-read his works again. And, since both you and I can draw different conclusions from different pieces of Malksoo's text, below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position, made specifically for us:
"""" The Baltic Sattes were occupied in June 1940 and annexed (incorporated) by the USSR in August 1940. Thus, both occupation and annexation DID happen. The fact of annexation - and that the USSR proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own, not occupied - changed the nature of the occupation, if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. For example, when 1980 Moscow olympic games took place, the olympic regatta took place in Tallinn. This cannot be a typical occupation situation.However, it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant Western opinion and post-1991 restored Baltic States themselves, the Soviet annexation remained illegal. In this sense, illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudo-debate. The annexation - since it remained illegal - did not create any extra rights to the annexing power, the USSR. If the article makes that aspect clear, I would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to """"Occupation and Annexation of the Baltic States"""". In fact, I would recommend such change because it takes more precisely (closer to the facts) into account the complex nature of the Soviet rule in the Baltic States.""""
What else do you need? Malksoo clearly says that in the case of the Baltic states both occupation and annexation took place, and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense (but not in others. P.S.) llegal annexation equals extended occupation. In other words, we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the Baltic states, and I never argued against that. Again, what synthesis you accuse me in?
Re """"there is no bridge between the Baltic and Soviet/official Russian positions; there is no in-between or continuum of scholarship, it's one or the other;"""" Wrong. There is a Baltic position, position of different foreign states (which was different from state to state and from time to time), positions of scholars (western, Baltic, Russian), Soviet positions (different during 1950s-70s and during Perestroika) and official Russian position.
Re """"From Glantz to Malksoo, a belligerent occupation."""" Glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the WWII, not in the legal aspects; Malskoo does not consider Soviet intervention in 1940 as a military operation at all. The only aggressive step, according to him, was a naval blockade.
Re """"Baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were """"colonized"""""""" Probably. However, other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the USSR, hence extensive influx of migrants. Was it possible if they had a colonial status?

""":Thanks Tom - that's a much better summary than the previous one. One question: in the comparison of UKIP's performance to that of other parties, I think saying that the SNP polled less than UKIP could be misleading for non-UK readers. If I didn't know that the SNP only stood candidates in Scotland, I'd get the impression from the current text that UKIP did much better than the SNP on average. But knowing that UKIP put up candidates across the country (while the SNP didn't) gives quite a different impression, since, of course, the SNP polled much better than UKIP everywhere it put up candidates. So for the benefit of non-UK readers, in the section comparing UKIP's performance to that of the Lib Dems and SNP, perhaps it might be helpful to add """"ahead of the Scottish National Party (who only contested seats in Scotland)""""?

I won't make that addition unless you approve, though.

Oh, one more thing - do we have a quote from a UKIP official or UKIP press release on the official reaction to the election result, or a link to an article about it? It would be interesting for readers to see what 'spin' the party put on what might otherwise be regarded as quite a disappointing result for them.

Red espresso is made by preparing the Aspalathus Linearis shrub, commonly known as the source of rooibos (or """"red"""") tea, to be filtered through an espresso machine http://www.coffeeandteafestival.com/newsletter/aug07.html.  When this patented form of the rooibos plant is filtered through an espresso machine, it results in a tea with a saffron crema.http://www.capeargus.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=342&fArticleId;=3100474

Red espresso has been patented http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2006126053 by a South African based companyhttp://www.redespresso.com.  Red espresso can be prepared in an espresso machine, but it can also be prepared in a drip coffee machine, French press, percolator, stove top espresso maker or steeped as strong tea.http://www.ostenzenherbs.com/page.html?chapter=3&id;=28 Red Espresso was featured as a new product at the World Tea Expo in 2008. http://www.worldteaexpo.com/attendee/review-new-products-at-the-2008-world-tea-expo.htmlIt won the blue-ribbon award 2008 at the Specialty Coffee World Assembles in Minneapolis for SCAA Conference.http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS134663+07-May-2008+BW20080507

Extracting tea through high temperature and pressure can be convenient for commercial use. For the individual it is slightly more expensive because it requires an espresso machine. Just like with coffee espresso, this extraction process results in a tea with concentrated flavor. There are pressurized machines being developed specifically for tea extraction.http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6220147-fulltext.html.

Scott A Brown, better known as spotteddogsdotorg on the Wikipedia because Scott A Brown wanted to make revenge on the evil spotteddogsdotorg who did not give Scott A Brown the WCAU as CBS tape which would have let Scott A Brown relive those good days so Scott A Brown made Wikipedia vandalism accounts to make the evil spotteddogsdotorg look evil on the Wikipedia.

If this discussion is to lead anywhere, you will have to formulate the specific, individual questions that need to be answered.   

 Albanau 

It has come to my attention that  has been actively promoting the existence of a """"Çamëria Liberation Army"""" on the Swedish Wikipedia,, identifying it and the more notorious UÇK of Kosovo with a struggle for """"human rights"""". This blatant promotion of armed Albanian extremist groups was later removed by another editor, but Albanau persisted, describing their actions as a reaction to """"cultural oppression"""". This reference too was later deleted as """"redundant propaganda"""". The existence of a such a group in Greece is in fact a matter of speculation, as later acknowledged by a fellow Albanian editor, and there is no reference to such a group on the English Wikipedia. Albanau's views appear to represent a particular mindset, intolerant of anyone or anything not towing the pan-Albanian extremist line, and we should exercise the utmost caution when reading anything signed by him.

In this article, it states that Korean cars are """"not known for quality"""". Although that it is true that Korean carswere pretty crappy in the 70's, this is no longerthe case. The latest Korean cars are exceeding most American car companies for quality today, and have started to match, and even bypass Japanese auto makers in terms of quality.

Universities have quotas for Coptic students considerably lower than their actual percentage within the population.Building new churches isn't allowed, and the old ones are falling into disrepair thanks to a lack both of money and authorization to renovate. When girls are kidnapped and forcibly converted, the police don't intervene. Thousands of pigs were also slaughtered under the pretense of confining swine flu. Naturally all were owned by Christians.

"""Page Updates and Controversy Section==

During our regular monitoring of social media and our internet reputation, members of the Marketing department at Raymond James noticed that much of the information on this page is outdated and/or incomplete.  We would like to take a more proactive approach to updating this information with current numbers, etc.  We are not sure who was responsible for originally writing the page, and we would like to make edits so that it reads less like a promotional piece/advertisement.

We would also like to put the following """"Controvery"""" section up for discussion.  This section was recently posted on the page, and reads unobjectively.  Many of the claims are not reliablity sourced, and the extensiveness of the section was disproportionate relative to both the size of our page and similar sections on competitors' pages.  We have left three of our majo/significant events on the page, and are including the smaller/unsourced claims here for discussion.  We are open to discussing how best to frame this section so that it reads more objectively.

Controversy

Raymond James has had been one of the most controversial firms with 49 regulatory events and 61 finalized arbitration's including housing several ponzi schemes according to Finra.http://brokercheck.finra.org/Support/ReportViewer.aspx In spite of all the controversy that surrounds Raymond James, the firm has been vocal about trying to prevent any increase in regulation of the financial services industry.http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0813601120101108 
Some of the most notable controversies have included:

In 1997, Charles LeCroy, a Raymond James banker, helped issue bonds in Jefferson County through a noncompetitive process. These bonds ended up funding corrupt activities and led to the county's bankruptcy.http://46in08.blogspot.com/2009/08/death-of-jefferson-county-alabama-and.html

In 2000, NASD regulators censured Raymond James & Associates, Inc. for “yield burning” activities on municipal securities. yield burning involves overcharges by brokerage firms on Treasury securities purchased with proceeds from the sale of municipal bonds. Yield burning by brokerage firms jeopardized the tax-exempt status of interest paid to holders of those bonds.The multi-million dollar settlement resolved the civil fraud charges under the False Claims Act against Raymond James. The payments made by Raymond James will also resolve certain tax-related claims of the Internal Revenue Service.http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2000-45.txt

In 2000, Raymond James was paid $650,000 to undertake the merger of HomeGold with smaller firms. The minimal amount of due diligence conducted by the firm prevented them from discovering the fraud that was going on. The parent firm later went bankrupt causing millions in losses and one of the biggest fraud cases in the state of South Carolina.http://www.usatoday.com/money/2004-02-05-homegold_x.htm

In 2003, Raymond James was found guilty of overcharging investors who made large purchases of mutual funds. There were nearly 160,000 trades that were overcharged and Raymond James had no systems in place to capture these trades.,http://www.txcm.com/reports/Raymond%20James%20mutual%20trading%20scandal.pdfhttp://registeredrep.com/institutions/raymondjames/finance_raymond_james_audits/

In 2005, the NASD fined Raymond James $750,000 for violations stemming from a failure to supervise the firm’s fee-based brokerage accounts.

In 2007, three ex-Raymond James employees sued, saying they were paid less than men and denied opportunities.http://www.sptimes.com/2007/10/21/Business/Women_claim_sex_bias_.shtml

In 2008, Jerry Rose was found to be conducting a ponzi scheme using Raymond James as custodian to the assets which amounted to over $16 million.http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2008/06/16/story13.html

In 2008, Raymond James received lots of criticism for using obscure provisions under SOX in which they denied whistle-blowing claims on the basis that the claims were made against a subsidiary company.http://whistlersear.wordpress.com/tag/sox-whistleblower/ These laws were reversed when the new Frank Dowd act was put into place on July 21, 2010. Raymond James was mentioned as one of the companies that abused the laws, as a means to conduct ethical and legal grounds. This included the case of John Hughart v. Raymond James in which the complaints regarding lax supervision in compliance was overlooked on the grounds that the employee worked a a subsidiary and therefore had no opportunity for restitution from Raymond James.http://www.oalj.dol.gov/Decisions/ALJ/SOX/2004/HUGHART_JOHN_v_RAYMOND_JAMES_and_AS_200",0

 Thoughts on a """"high school"""" A7 

As I am, of course, well aware following my RfA, CSD A7 explicitly exempts schools.  Do you believe that it applies to """"online"""" schools; specifically, Denver Online High School?  I just removed the speedy deletion template, though I'm not really sure it qualifies for the exception.  Looking at their webpage (just added as an EL to the article), it looks like they probably are real, and seem at least somewhat connected to the Denver public school system (though they also seem to charge fees, which confuses me).  If the are operated by the State, then they probably even meet the general """"All high schools are automatically notable"""" AfD exemption.  

Obviously, the article needs clean-up, but I'd rather wait and see if it should even be an article before doing so.   
This is indeed  a public school, though private high schools are just as notable as public ones. (I don't see a mention of fees, but most public schools do collect some sort of fee, and almost all charge tuition to students from outside their district.) The article however was totally unacceptablemainly devoted to the names of the teachers. I removed that, but there is still much necessary rewriting.  The real question for an online school at this or any level  would be whether it is actually a separate school, or merely a programwe cannot necessarily go by the name it calls itself. If a program, it would best go in the article for the Denver Board of Education. My feeling is that it an actual  separate school, but for something like this, a 3rd party reference will be really helpful.  What it clearly is not is a mere tutoring center or support facility, which are almost never notable.   ' ( talk ) 
That all sounds very reasonable to me; I figured erring on the side of caution (removing the A7) was the better choice.  Thanks for the trimming; I'll go take a look and see if I can find any sort of third party sources.    

 Notability of high schools 

Hi  I hope you have been well.  I seem to recall, and have stated (or mis-stated, as the case may be) that I thought you may have said in the past that (verifiable) high schools are generally presumptively notable.  But, in the event I've mis-spoken as to what you said, feel free to correct me.  I made mention of my recollections at an AfD where I've not myself !voted (as of yet), here:  Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mesivta Tiferes Yisroel.  Best.  
such is the accepted compromise: high schools have articles, elementary schools in the absence of special notability get merged. But the compromise , like all informal and formal Wikipedia rules, has effect only as long as people here want it to have effect. I think recent decisions have upheld this in general, but there are always one or two people who challenge it. Such is probably the case here,There may be other factors, though, which I mention them at the AfD. ' ( talk ) 

Inherent notability for elementary schools which have been """"Blue Ribbon Schools""""
I am contacting you because you participated in either the AFD Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kennedy Middle School (Cupertino, California) which resulted in a redirect or the deletion review Wikipedia:Deletion review#Kennedy Middle School (Cupertino, California) which resulted in restoration of the article because it was once a """"Blue Ribbon School"""". I have opened a discussion at Wikipedia talk:Notability (organizations and companies)#US elementary schools: Inherent notability: for """"Blue Ribbon Schools"""" as to whether the 5200 schools which have been found awarded the """"Blue Ribbon"""" seal of approval get inherent notability, or if they each have to satisfy WP:ORG via significant coverage in multiple reliable and independent sources. Your input is welcome. Thanks!    
P.S. Should I have made this a """"RFC?"""" I rarely get involved in such general policy forums.

Neuropsychological assessment of a practicing dentist with elevated urinary mercury. 
Fundamental and Applied Toxicology, 
Supplement:
The Toxicologist, 15, 1, March, 1995. 

NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF A PRACTICING DENTIST WITH ELEVATED URINARY MERCURY. 

R. Singer. Santa Fe, 

New Mexico, USA 

Dentists are exposed to mercury from amalgam (composed of 52% mercury, 8% copper, 37% silver) used as implants for dental restoration. 

A recent study of 32% of Singapore's dentists found mercury 
dose-related neuropsychological deficits when compared with controls. 

The current subject, a dentist practicing for 14 years in the USA, was referred by his physician for neurobehavioral examination. 

The subject presented with symptoms including fatigue, GI problems, sweats, tremors, rashes, bowel dyscontrol, and heart arrhythmia. 

Tremors of the hand and eyelid affect the subject's hand stability while working. 

Results of the Neurotoxicity Screening Survey showed a profile of symptoms consistent with neurotoxicity. 
Urine sampling (24 h) over the past year found 2.1 - 99 ppb mercury, averaging 35 ppb (expected range < 2 ppb; atomic fluorescence spectrometry). 

High readings may be related with chelation therapy. 

Current IQ was at the 87% (% = percentile; 91-96% or greater estimated pre-morbidly), consistent with his presentation as an intelligent, competent dentist. 
In contrast to a relatively high IQ, appropriate neuropsychological testing revealed that the subject 
has deficits in immediate memory (16%); 
visuospatial perception (50%);
visual memory; visual figure-ground perception (50%);
verbal learning (2-5%); mental flexibility (12%);
attentional processes (19%); logical memory (p < .004);
and non-verbal recognition memory (50%). 

Neuropsychological testing helped confirm mercury toxicity affecting multiple organ systems. 
Such deficits impact the subject's ability to practice dentistry, and raises questions as to effects of mercury in other dentists, as well as possible",0

 re: VfD bot assistant 
When you get to the actual closing process, I'm not sure I know what could be safely automated.  So many of the decisions require multiple steps.  But I may not be the right person to ask.  I tend to close only the oldest and therefore the most complex discussions.  I suspect that I see all the exceptions and lose sight of the commonalities among the majority of """"simple"""" decisions.  I'll give it some thought, though.  

Am I correct in assuming that the bot would have to be run for each individual discussion thread?  If so, what parameters would have to be fed in?  How complex would it be to initiate the bot?  Would it be a different bot for """"keep"""" decisions vs """"delete"""" decisions?

The essential steps for a """"keep"""" decision are:
 Close the discussion page ({{subst:vt}} and {{subst:vb}} - I suppose the top subst could be modified to allow for a parameter like {{subst:vt|reason}})
# Remove the VfD header from the page (which ''usually'' follows the naming convention of the VfD discussion page except for second nominations and related nominations discussed together
# Add a boilerplate comment to the article's Talk page with a link to the discussion.  I usually put the nomination date on the Talk page, but the closure date is probably close enough.

If the VfD discussion has the same name as the article, a simple """"keep"""" decision might be automatable with a single parameter.  """"Keep as merge"""", """"transwiki"""", etc. would still require extra steps.

The essential steps for a """"delete"""" decision are:
# Check the article's history to confirm that the deletion decision is in order
# Close the discussion page (as above but the reason is often much more detailed)
# Sometimes, check """"what links here"""" and move or delete all those links
# Delete the page

I'm not sure I see how to automate that process.  There are too many variables.  I'll keep chewing on it, though.  Thanks again.  ~~~~""",0
