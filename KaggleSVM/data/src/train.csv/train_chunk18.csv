Based on the prosecutions and lost civil lawsuits against DHS and Children's Services I've seen in the media since then, it would appear little has changed since then, either.

It answers the question about why A.L. does not deal with doctrine. It is because everything need not be part of the Magisterium. Indeed, he raises the question of whether the idea of one is necessary or not. What most popes write is pretty ephemeral. Time is bigger than space is interesting, of course in physics they are one thing. Realities being bigger than ideas is a great antidote to a Curia which is obsessed with sexual morality based on first principles without bothering to check with current research and the experience of real people. That unity prevails over conflict is why he simply ignores people sniping at his heals from the cheap seats. Fr. Imbelli thinks the principles are still uncertain.

Uses more water in a water resource scarce climate, on rooftops with no shade over the plants, resulting in a faster evaporation cycle for water. It may or may not be good for the environment, there's much in play with that.

The soil doesn't absorb moisture, like it would at ground level, so any excess is drained off and added to the water treatment system. Not being able to have deep roots, using fertilizers, it will likely be an issue the public won't be aware of. Similar to the ethanol mandate (on a smaller level), with drainoff really messing up the Mississippi delta flowing out to the gulf.

But it feels good.... for some to say something's being done for the environment.

Recently, I asked the Domicans to pay for mental health therapy to help me deal with the issues that still linger with me due to the sexual abuse. The Dominican Church refuses to guarantee that they will pay for mental health therapy for me, They imply that IF they pay for it, that it will be limited.

Showing how seriously he takes such political violence, Putin has taken personal charge of all the investigations. Sadly nobody has yet been charged in any of them. Obviously this is through no fault of Putin who is sincerely putting his KGB training to good use trying to find the assassins.

But the ANC has a problem neither the Nats nor Putin had - an abundance of free press and a highly independent judiciary. This makes high-level assassinations fairly rare, and when they do happen they are more often to eliminate internal competition within the party or among it's corrupt friends (KZN gets lots of that on the lower rungs) but also consider Lolly Jackson, Bret Kebble etc. - situations where the state doesn't really have to risk getting it's own hands very dirty.

It's not a case of a crime only committed by females, it's a case of a patriarchal view of gender roles that holds only the females ACCOUNTABLE for the abandonment of a child - a direct consequence of the assumption that childcare is primarily a mother's job, and the consequent belief that a father abandoning a child is a lesser social ill.

Now angry politicians want the death to mark an end to a witch-hunt sparked by a sex scandal that has rocked Parliament to its core.
Now, y'see, ushering a woman through a door with your hand on her upper back is seen by many as 'inappropriate' and by some as assault - even though intended just as gentlemanly good manners: ladies first.
Tell a woman her dress suits her and you could be in deep dwang, ditto tell a risque joke.
So was Sargeant guilty? Who knows: it seems that without even knowing the nature of the alleged offences (he ‘begged party chiefs to tell him sex pest allegations’ before killing himself) he was tried, found guilty, hung, drawn and quartered.
Butchered.
So he killed himself... what chance of a fair hearing?

Well yeah. 

As for the 'statistics', suppose someone steps out onto a crosswalk, texting away, at the same time a car (maybe too close to come to a stop?) comes zooming along. 

Q: Who is at fault? 

A: For the pedestrian, it doesn't matter. 

And if you want to start relying exclusively on 'statistics', how many accidents are caused by cars that 'don't come to a complete stop at a stop sign'??

'Common sense' suggests it isn't a good idea, which is another way to say, 'People shouldn't do this'. 

Pass the law and, probably very occasionally, it will be enforced. And if the G&M bothers to report these times, it will encourage other people to pay attention when crossing the road.

Yes, antifluoridationists do deem facts, evidence, and peer-reviewed science to be “empty badgering” .  This is precisely why you all remain so completely uninformed on this issue.  

Since you so obviously resent our challenging and correction of the mounds of misinformation posted by antifluoridationists then simply stop posting it and we will gladly go away.  As that will, of course, never happen, you probably should just get used to us.

As a conservative, I can tell you that I would never cast a vote for a candidate that promoted an appeal to racism, and I think that your references are correct that that's what Gillespie was going for.  But where you're wrong (as usual, Michael) is that Gillespie's late race-baiting is likely what led him to lose by an even larger measure than he - a non-conservative Republican - would have lost by otherwise.  Trump never ran as a racist, but lefties like you, Michael, and Gillespie, misunderstand that to be the case.  Trump won as a nationalist, populist, not a divider.  And as long as divider candidates are going to be trotted out, regardless of party, they are going to lose.

What you personally  claim to “know” does not represent what “we all know”.  

There is no “wear and tear” on water mains  from fluoridated water.  Fluoridation substances are gone before water leaves the treatment plant, and a minuscule amount of fluoride ions in fluoridated water do not cause “wear and tear” on anything.

There is no “experimentation” involved in water fluoridation.  Competent water treatment personnel are educated and trained in how to properly deal with the myriad substances routinely added to public water supplies.

Henry actually had solid grounds for an annulment. His father, Henry VII, arranged a marriage between his eldest son, Arthur, and Catherine of Aragon. A few months afterwards, Arthur died. The king wanted to keep the Catherine's dowry (over a million in today's currency, which would have had to be repaid out of the Privy Purse).

While you enjoy the lavish setting and great cast, you are also forced to actively process the infirmation thrown at you in the form of a mathematical scatter plot that is obscure, scattered and at times apparently illogical. However, there is a reason for that. In order to be happy, one must acheive the balance in his soul: the balance of good and bad, hot and cold, reality and dreams, justice and injustice.

No, I'm not say alcohol doesn't have any financial or social cost.  If I wanted to say that I would have. It's not ""my line of argument"" at all. Where'd you get that

You're right, the tax doesn't begin to cover the cost, but the reason you may be correct is this: liquor tax revenues (which are HUGE and ever-growing) aren't funnelled directly into those ""astronomical"" liquor costs.  They go elsewhere. 

I'm interested by the rest of your post.  So, druggies are passive, ""don't fight"" and so, somehow, I take it, they're ""better"" (or maybe, less violent) than those who abuse alcohol? We may be testing that out when millions of pot puffers get behind the wheels of their cars. 
What community?  I'd be interested in stats. So if we remove prohibition ""most of the harms"" magically disappear?  I'll argue that one.

- You are correct.
- Adultery happens and it is a sin.
- For a sin to be a sin several criteria have to occur somewhat simultaneously. For instance the person must desire the action, commit the action, and consent to the action. If any of these criteria are impaired or not operative at the time of the sinful act, then the act, while wrong, does not constitute a sin.

‘Another report on how it was not just Canada... FWIW: TPP agreement ends in 'misunderstanding', via @nzherald

One country has dramatically blocked the TPP trade deal after ministers from the 11 countries celebrated an agreement late last night.

Trade Minister David Parker confirmed that ministers had agreed with much ""celebratory clapping and back-slapping"" after meeting last night, but when it was handed on to officials, one country decided that there was no deal.

Parker would not name the country - but said it was not Canada, which had earlier denied reports that an agreement-in-principle had been reached.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-10 15:39:59.694724+00,54,,399258,approved,0,0,0,0,3,0.0,0,4

Show me where I said, ""Taxing drugs is a bad idea...""

I think the opposite.  I'm all for it. As far as taxes-paying-for-costs, I much prefer legalization to the ""help stay stoned"" safe-site methodology of ""saving lives"" (because those lives are supposedly saved at my tax-payer expense.) I'm not naive: alcohol taxes don't go to treat alcoholics and bring aid and comfort to their traumatized families. They go into general revenues. Will drug taxes be any different? 

It's about choice.  MY choice to pay for drugs. It's no different than booze. I choose to buy alcohol upon occasion. I pay a tax for the privilege of doing so. I accept that. I don't like it? I stop drinking. Or drink less.

It ought to be obvious by now that this is not so. When Church leaders pretend to deny that the souls of the laity are shaped by a constant exercise of freedom or lament the passing of the good old days when there was a lot less freedom, they have turned their faces against history.

""One possible result: many, many more abusers, because shooting up, toking up, sniffing up will be even more socially acceptable--oh, hey, and safer!--than it is today.""

That's one _possible_ result, but consider this: the most effective way to reduce smoking rates turned out to be regulations that make it socially difficult to smoke. The use of currently-illegal drugs is _already_ highly proscribed among the general public due to decades of demonization of drug users, so it's difficult to imagine legalization suddenly changing this.

Regrettably, ""mainstreaming"" is a very misunderstood term.  To be sure, the concept of ""least restrictive appropriate educational environment"" is crucial and needs to be followed.

The fact that Turkey has been cozying up to Russia recently (normalization, buying Russia's missile defense) means that they will be demonized in the western media. This could be the real agenda here.

I cannot believe that a former high ranking General like Flynn would not know all this. I expect this will turn out be very similar to the Don Jr. Russian lawyer meeting where a meeting was set up under a false pretext and the real agenda only came to light later.

Once you make pot available at the corner drug store--which, incidentally, still can't sell booze--you make it socially acceptable. Not ""prevalent"" or even ""allowable"" but ACCEPTABLE.

Why do you think Shoppers wants in? Yeah, sure, it's ""medicinal.""  So was the booze pharmacies once sold with a doctor's prescription. Pardon my scepticism.

Pot on the roads today?  Sure.  But nothing like it'll likely be once it's legal and the stigma is gone.  ""Must be safe...It's legal, right?""

Instead, it seems that 'successful' Popes must have 'rock star' qualities in regard to the size of the crowds they attract (invariably described as a million or more fawning / fainting individuals raising up their babies or doing their best to take a 'selfie' with the Pope.

As a country, we've been sending mixed messages - we want cheap goods and services, but when undocumented workers get caught, the employers get a slap on the wrist while immigrant families are torn apart.

Why should someone be allowed to move their capital, tax-free, into Cdn. RE, inflate market prices by doing so, and then cash out their investment, also tax-free?  Such people leech the system. They don't pay a fair share of taxes to support the way of life and services that make Cdn. communities, and hence the RE investments themselves, valuable.

It's Cdn. taxpayers who take the hit: higher housing costs, job losses due to those costs, diminished quality of life, higher taxes and/or poorer services and infrastructure to make up for those RE investors who aren't paying their share.  The present rules and laissez-faire enforcement are only good if they are of net benefit to the majority of Cdn. citizens. We've seen the results, and the net benefit clearly isn't there. Changes to the rules and how we scrutinize RE investments are long overdue. Gov't. measures so far have been mostly ineffective.

Someone should apprise me if I’m wrong but we have yet to see lower taxes and deregulation here in Canada.

More appropriately , free trade has hollowed out our middle class, reduced our wage growth and turned our economy into hewers Of wood and providers of  low paying service jobs.

And it’s getting worse under this bumbling and corrupt Govt  Which increasing taxes, adding regulations like carbon taxes that make us less competitive and removing/ capping incentives like the TFSA permit our millenials to put away a bit of cash for a rainy day.

You're right. ...for some kids that is clearly NOT the regular classroom.

  The chaos described in the story on Edison is inexcusable....schools need to have appropriate IEPs in place, specific intervention plans and procedures and insure that ""dysfunctioning"" students are ""removed from the classroom at the time of the dysfunction"" if it is creating an unsafe or unproductive climate for the rest of the students.  The duration of that ""removal"" would be determined by those persons involved in administering the IEP.

Some international media quickly blamed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the meeting’s sudden cancellation.

The heads of the 11 countries that have been negotiating a revised Trans-Pacific Partnership had planned to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation leaders’ summit in Danang, Vietnam.

Trudeau did not go to the conference room at the scheduled time to meet the other TPP leaders.""

Did Jesus drink wine? He was perhaps a Nazorean sworn to not drink wine (Acts 24:5 footnote “Nazoreans,” and Mt 2:23). In Mk 14:25, “I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine,” the word “again” does imply some previous drinking of wine, but not necessarily in that setting which was the Last Supper (also Mt 26:29). Maybe Jesus took some wine before he became a follower of John the Baptist, who did not drink wine (Lk 1:15)

At the Last Supper Jesus offers a 'cup.' What was in it? By the way, Jews did not drink blood, so we know it was not actually blood. On the cross, Jesus was offered vinegar/wine which he maybe did not actually swallow -- texts not clear. Was this vinegar from grapes or some other fruit? Yes, wine would be a typical drink at Passover, but John has Jesus die before Passover

I had been hoping we'd get something more like the BBC world news or the PBS Nightly Newshour, i.e., a real news program. Instead, CBC has gone the other way, more into infotainment.

2. If non-anglo named lawyers are getting more complaints from clients then it could be (a) that they're worse lawyers and conducting themselves worse than their anglo peers and so garner more complaints, (b) this group is more likely to be complained about because clients are acting on their prejudices, (c) this group attracts clients who are just more likely to complain, or (d) some combination of the above.

Frankly, the non-anglo named lawyers I've dealt with are more likely to 1. Not be native English speakers and run into language problems, and 2. Tend to have gone to out of jurisdiction law schools that were inferior to Ontario law schools.

The first problem is the time period that data covers.

We should certainly define ""resident"" more narrowly.  I'd be in favour of banning RE purchases by anyone in Canada on an international student visa, 10-year visa, or TFW permit.

That said, what's to stop a Cdn. citizen or PR from accepting untaxed money from a ""supporter,"" buying RE, cashing out later, and splitting the tax-free profit with said ""supporter""?  In many cases, the ""supporter"" would reside off-shore.

 Aug. 9, 2011, 6:01 PM 	142,532
On a visit to Brazil yesterday, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper locked himself in one of the foreign minister's bathrooms, protesting the Brazilian president's decision that toasts and speeches take place after her lunch with Harper, and not during the lunch, as Harper wanted. The prime minister refused to leave the bathroom until the Brazilian president gave in to his demands, the Washington Post reports.""

Depends on total sales.  I have read in aviation-related sites that break-even is anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 units.  Both Airbus and BBD seem to think they can grab around half of a market of 6,000.  Depends on your time frame and US duties, if any, I would think.

Fluoridation simply adjusts the concentration of existing fluoride in public water systems to the level where maximum disease prevention occurs in those served by that system, with no adverse effects.  Fluoride is colorless, odorless, and tasteless.  There is no valid reason to fear consuming fluoridated water.  Those with an irrational phobia about fluoride in their water are certainly free to obtain their own water from wherever they choose.  However any inconvenience and expense involved in placating such phobias are the responsibility of those persons, not of society.

Trump is quick to defend them and denigrate the US. For example, when Trump was questioned on Putin's homicidal past Trump jumped to Putin's defense.

According to the published reports (which probably are actually inaccurate in light of the reality of the real estate market), the Kealoha's home is mortgaged to the hilt.

They sell their home (particularly one with so much controversy surrounding it - thereby likely reducing the value) and they likely have ZERO left over from the sale.

Since 1998[edit]
From the inception of the NICS system in 1998 through 2014, more than 202 million Brady background checks have been conducted.[21] During this period approximately 1.2 million attempted firearm purchases were blocked by the Brady background check system, or about 0.6 percent.[22] The most common reason for denials are previous felony convictions.[22]

Prosecution and conviction of violators of the Brady Act, however, is extremely rare. During the first 17 months of the Act, only seven individuals were convicted. In the first year of the Act, 250 cases were referred for prosecution and 217 of them were rejected.[23]

A 2000 study found that the implementation of the Brady Act was associated with ""reductions in the firearm suicide rate for persons aged 55 years or older but not with reductions in homicide rates or overall suicide rates.""[24]",0.1666666666666666,0.1666666666666666,0.1666666666666666,0.0,0.1666666666666666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-10 21:28:49.967615+00,13,6332560.0,398697,approved,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,6

It used to be that a core conservative principle was that government should not be interfering in private enterprise.  But interfering in the employer-employee relationship is exactly what Trump is doing.  The President of the United States is telling some employers to fire some of their employees.  Trump is violating a core conservative principle, but that's OK with conservatives.

The last one was left winger too, one who was a spy and fled America when caught while out on bail, Bill Haywood. 
Seems the left has a much greater history with the Russians, especially in betraying America, than the right wingers. They were more apt to be what the communists have enjoyed using the most through the decades. See, I lean more to the right personally speaking, not exactly socialist or communist material.

More jobs, more people, more money, faster improvements on other things which are created by more jobs, more people, and more money.  Increased housing values, more education people, higher paying jobs, better infrastructure, added flights, more public transit, and on and on.  It would all come - both before and after amazon. 

You mention Denver sucks up half the transportation budget - we’ll guess what - denver metro is over half the population. 
Amazon coming here would be a great get for the vast majority in the Denver metro area as well as many others across the state. That fact means amazon coming here would be a great get for Colorado as a whole.

The latest example of this was the Globe's ban on the interesting word ""fey"" simply because some individual or group didn't like it.

I suggested that people really should stop taking offence, especially when none was intended.

I pointed out that I'm an ""old"" man, but might bristle if a Globe writer described me as such. Should that, though, be cause to ban all Globe scribblers from using the word ""old"" when writing about old people? Of course not.

The unwillingness of Republicans to talk about the constitutional rights of various groups is causing as many devisions as the Dems. willingness to address these issues. This is what we need to address. Yet you seem to see it as only one way. We will never come together if we think unification is others agreeing with our positions. That is why we have a Supreme court to address these issues. 

I have trouble believing those, who come to a blog that support a different ideology and scorn, sneer and rant against that ideology and those, who support it, then take the position that it is the other, who are the divisive ones. This is just as true for the liberals, who go to conservative blogs.

We are called to start with ourselves. What are we doing to heal the devisions? How do your posts heal divisions? Are you willing to address that?

The ancestor(s) of the domesticated dog were animals that formed groups and therefore had a social order.
The ancestor of the domesticated cat was Felix sylvestris lybica, which looks a lot like a tabby cat. It's a solitary animal which gets together only for mating. There have been recent news articles that biologists now think people domesticated Felix sylvestris lybica in different places at different times in the Middle East and Near East. And then people brought cats with them (or the cats tagged along) as people migrated. And only relatively recently have cats been brought into the home on a large scale.

The OHA was set up to manage the funds derived from the non reserved trust lands while the funds derived from the reserved trust lands were used to improve the reserved lands so they could be settled by 50-100 natives.

Capital Gains Taxes  are in large measure  cynically applied to simple inflation increases in an investment. Inflation which has been created by Monetary Policy.

Also, the funds used to invest were already taxed and heavily.

I remember when Capital Gains Taxes were  first introduced; Capital Losses could be deducted against 'Other Income' ; but when reality struck, that many, if not most  people actually lose Money in the Stock Market,  the Ideological Bureaucratic Interests promoting Capital  Gains Taxation quickly rationalised  the new tax to allow only Losses against Gains.

Correct.

It's messy--and offensive to many, but when you allow anyone to become the censor, however pure their motives, freedom is lost.  

It's like Oregon having a Board of Eugenics for 70 years to cull Oregon of defective people. They had the best of intentions, but the last Court of Appeals case in 1973 approved the involuntary sterilization of a girl who had been driven crazy by her father's sex abuse.

I used to work in mental health and addictions, & I saw the impact on the level of stigma associated with mental illness when Michael Wilson went public about having lost a family member to mental illness.

We desperately need someone--several someones--of Wilson's profile to ""come out"" about addiction. It's profoundly stigmatized--including by many members of the medical community who have had little to no education, training, or experience with people with substance use problems.
