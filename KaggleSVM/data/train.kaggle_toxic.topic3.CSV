 Ok Bobrayner, I will refrain from posting to the main definition of Inertial_Propulsion, if you will recognize my efforts in the field in the Discussion page.
 
I TOTALLY understand that controversial subjects that have the mantle of Dogma on it's shoulders has an uphill battle. I only request that others look over what I have done in the field, and debate the evidence, rather than throw stones at """"the other"""", that does NOT conform to current beliefs.
 

Do you have any creative suggestions for how to add the GIT (Gyroscopic Inertial Thruster) definition of machine types to the main page?  It is a clearly novel approach to the subject, and has had positive (as well as negative) results in the real world.
 
""""Force Rectifying"""" angular accelerations to produce linear acceleration as a """"footloose"""" example of """"tractoring"""" on the """"Zero Point Field"""" has actual physical examples to give it credence, but the intolerance of science as a religion prevents rational debate, and examination.
 
When I whirl around on a merry-go-round, the forces I feel tugging me off of that ride, to the outside, are NOT a result of tiny bullets, impinging on me!
 
ALL of matter, that has """"inertia"""" feels it's place in this universe through some kind of interaction with the universe around it.
 
While the """"Aether"""" was discredited because it did NOT conform to our definition of a classical gas, the Zero Point Field (Rueda, Puthoff, and Haisch), describes a coupling of baryonic matter with it's surroundings.
 
This is the medium that the GIT series of thrusters """"tractor"""" on.
 
I am a fairly simple guy, with beliefs engendered by my experiences, and I refuse to """"toe the party line"""", when reality, trumps """"faith"""".

Unspecified source for Image:Zengesnertrumpet.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Zengesnertrumpet.jpg. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following this link.

 biggest problem? 

the only problem with all of this is that Wikipedia IS evil.
With all of the rules and all of the noise, what it still comes
down to is a mob of people doing whatever they want as a mob, against reason, against fairness, against logic, and against truth.
Theres no way to deal with abuse and no recourse for the abused. The place runs on ad hominems and pack psychology. It panders to the lowest common denominator, and in the end its articles are well neutered of any actual depth content or meaning. """"Neutrality"""" as a buzzword is used to emascualte a topic so that it has no political
implications or consequences. The same standing is given to a pov warrior and a pet admin as is given to a knowledgable expert. Opinion rules here, not wisdom, and not even any real form of neutrality. Wikipedia IS factually evil. The question here, is how
to go about fixing that problem. Denial won't help.

Well, enough bothering with pearls and swine for today, my """"contributions"""" file should speak for itself. I have been involved in 3 vfds since showing up, each one of which was run on ad hominems and straw man attacks. I have been blocked on trumped up charges by a pov warrior and his pet rogue admin. I have sought from every corner of Wikipedia some sort of actual problem solving process to adress patent abuses, all to no avail. Wikipedia is in fact evil, and it deserves to fail as an encylopedia unless it can
solve its problems. Unless wikipedia can figure out how to not be a mob groupthink social experiment where any idiot, fool, con artist,
or propagandist can assume equal footing with knowledge and fact,
Wikipedia is just a big fat doomed social experiment, which will die
because enough people will recognize that it is in fact evil, and go
do better and more important things with their time, like start A REAL online Encylopedia that includes logic and knowledge and truth and basic criteria for defining abuse and basic methodlogies for dealing with it.

 BLP, ethnicity, gender 

Remember a couple of years back, when I tried a common subpage for both policy and guidelines? And you objected, so we split them back up?

Well, as I predicted, they've diverged over time. And now the wiki-lawyers are arguing that """"policy"""" trumps """"guidelines"""".  Since the BLP policy doesn't specifically mention Ethnicity and Gender, while at least a half dozen guidelines do, it's been disrupting WP:CFD, and WP:EGRS, and quite a bit else.

Could you take a look at the main (above), and see whether you support adding Ethnicity and Gender into the policy?

And do you know of anywhere that the Policy and Guidelines has language about precedence?

I suppose that this boils down to prescriptivism versus descriptivism, yet another matter we have discussed. We need both, because the wiki-lawyers look for loopholes.

Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello, Wikid77 here. I am contacting a few admins about this. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:
 """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.
 """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.
 """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.
 """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.
 """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.
I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  """                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,0

Sorting and proper English WP:SORT reads in part, """"[S]ort keys are used to exclude prefixes that are... considered unimportant (such as """"The"""")."""" The Beatles are sorted as """"Beatles"""", The Rolling Stones are sorted as """"Rolling Stones"""", etc. There is no compelling reason to ignore this convention in this case. Even if the band always insists upon using a non-standard style, this style guide trumps their preference for inclusion in categories at Wikipedia. —❤T☮C☺M☯ """                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,0

"And now for some... amusement 

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy!

 yes, I am aware of all of these things, see user:frietjes/vector.css and #Solution for you and my comments on the talk page of wp:accessibility.  my initial problem was that any css modifications would be ignored by inline style statements, but it appears there is a way to use """"!important"""" to trump those changes.  it just gets very tedious to have to create an entirely new style sheet because someone thinks red on green looks great.  it's an ongoing process.   I have also been working on some greasemonkey stuff to modify such things everywhere on the web, but that has been slow going, given the myriad of ways people can add junk.  thank you though.

"Re: TTS. Surely you jest  he is the definition of partisan, though it is perhaps telling that you feel he is not while UH scholars are. For LaCroix, you may wish to start here. Finally, WP:UNDUE trumps the argument you are trying to make, I'm afraid  not all POVs are equal. The cites I removed were justified on the basis that they were pushing a POV. Again, the mere fact that POV statement/push is cited (the additions you so often make being quite the textbook examples of cherry-picking) does not legitimize it. This is elemental, and most unfortunate that you do not so recognize. 

As for Viriditas' message, I couldn't agree more. If what it takes is taking this (and some of the other articles) to mediation, which I assume is what Viriditas means, I would support that if that's where we need to go to get the articles back to a NPOV. The current process of doing so is proving to be unnecessarily contentious and involving a high degree of nitpicking that is an utter waste of everyone's time."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,0
"Concerning Ms. Rees and Miss Universe Organization/Donald Trump... 

As far as I'm concerned, Donald Trump is a hypocrite and has shown that he holds double standards. I mean, at Ms. Conner's press conference, he said he was all for 2nd chances. Then, Ms. Rees comes along, asking for just that, a 2nd chance. I mean, what Conner did was WAY worse than what Ms. Rees did."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,0
""":::I really don't care about the few google searches that result (one of which is this site). If I put in Chelsea or Boys Town (halstead st, Chicago) TONS of hits appear.  Not a handful.  Gays don't have to wear signs.  But there should be more than one drinking establishment that caters to them.  The one dike bar on 4th ave is usually pretty dead, as is the one on 5th ave.  The point is there IS no gay community.  A few lesbians does not a community make.  But I'm not denying that lesbians call the neighborhood home.  It has been a liberal neighborhood for 30 years.  The point is, the term itself, Dyke Slope.  I don't like it.  I've never heard it.  I don't think its appropriate for Wikipedia.  And don't tell me what to do.  I can type whatever I feel like on this page.

I think you sound like a delusional, academic lesbian who wishes you had a neighborhood of your own.  I've never even denied that lesbians are found in the neighborhood.  My point is that while they have always been present, perhaps in greater numbers than elsewhere, they have had minimal impact on the neighborhood. They certainly have not been numerous enough to warrant a term like """"Dike Slope"""".  The reality is lesbianism is largely an academic phenomenon.  It doesn't surprise me in the slightest some professor would make such a claim.  But, that one class does not trump a substantial portion of my personal experience over many years.

"This plot description is much superiorcomments? 

“Joliet” Jake Blues is released from the Joliet Correctional Center after serving three years of a prison sentence after being convicted of armed robbery. Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment). At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Band.
  
As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall. 

After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher). The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room, the mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.

Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with a U.S. flag and an Illinois flag).

Jake and Elwood begin tracking down members of the band. Trombonist Tom “Bones” Malone and the rhythm section of the group (Willie “Too Big” Hall, Steve “The Colonel” Cropper, Donald “Duck” Dunn, and Murphy “Murph” Dunné) known as “Murph and the Magictones”, are playing in an empty Holiday Inn lounge, “The Armada Room”, and are readily convinced to rejoin The Blues Brothers’ Band. Trumpeter “Mister Fabulous” (Alan Rubin), now maître d' at a restaurant, is more of a challenge to persuade (“you ain′t never gonna get ’em outta those high-payin’ gigs”), but Jake and Elwood rudely convince him with some dining-room hijinks. En route to meet saxophonist Louis “Blue Lou” Marini and guitarist Matt “Guitar” Murphy, The Blues Brothers drive through a rally of neo-Nazis (upon whom Jake comments “Illinois Nazis—I hate Illinois Nazis!”) and adding another enemy to the The Blues Brothers’ growing list of pursuing parties. Marini and Murphy are working at the soul food restaurant on Maxwell Street, in Calumet City, Illinois, which Murphy owns with his wife (Aretha Franklin). Against her advice, the two musicians leave and rejoin the band. The reunited group obtain new musical instruments and associated equipment from Ray (Ray Charles) of Ray’s Music Exchange, in Calumet City, Illinois, on loan, pending payment from the proceeds of The Blues Brothers’s Band’s pending ‘triumphant return’.

Jake is unable to book a gig in advance, a"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,0

Cruft in trivia section
A backstage segment featuring dancing is certainly fancruft that doesn't belong. It being a reunion of sorts (and it being at WM) doesn't make it any more notable at all. The dance segment didn't affect any of the matches and certainly doesn't help the article.  
I suggest moving to the notes section.   3:16 
It's always been in the notes section, that's not the problem here. The problem is: it's a backstage segment. Backstage segments aren't notable, and don't affect the matches or anything... why add this one over others? Just because it was a reunion isn't a good enough reason in my opinion. People certainly could argue the Boogey Man/Trump segment was notable, as it featured the first time the 2 had interaction (or just on the fact Trump appeared). It's fancruft and serves no purpose except that some people might think it's """"interesting"""". That's not enough to keep it on the article.  
Oh I didn't see that. Hmmm... let me see what I can do with it...   3:16 

I think that we should just add them to the other talent section if they aren't there already and not mention the dance. It was pretty pointless, and doesn't seem necessary. Peace,  The rid 
While I agree that the Boogeyman segment wasn't notable, this segment had the return of Slick (first time in like 15 years) and a bunch of other WWE legends. It being a reunion and at WM does help its case IMO (especially the reunion part). You are saying being a backstage segment is the problem, so you wouldn't be objecting if they had done this on the stage or in the ring? If we mentioned them in the on screen talent section, what would we put down for them so someone else doesn't remove it. It also got covered in most reviews and coverage of the event (coevering the notability part). Being cruft is an opinion; being a reunion featuring over a dozen legends and covered by almost every review makes it worth at least mentioning.  

Eh, the return of Slick is pretty important. I'll change my vote to Weak Support, as I had forgotten about that point. Peace,  The rid 
Covered in almost every review? I find that very hard to believe. Provide some proof. Also: so what if it's covered? The matches are reviewed in the reviews as well: that doesn't mean we will start listing highlights for each match. I also recall there being a guideline on Wikipedia about it not being a democracy: meaning not everything should be determined by a vote. I somehow think if this fancruft was gone: no one would be re-adding except for TJ. From the edit history: it seems like he was the only one re-adding it back. That certainly shows that people don't care about it. A few talk page posts in favor of it: isn't much consensus to keep it on the article.  
 and  among others. Other people have added it back, I just get to it first usually.  
Considering OWW is a fansite, only the Slam link is reliable. Anyone can write a review and mention it: fansites aren't a reliable source. I've seen no edit history of anyone else re-adding it back, so I'm still going to believe no one else has (until I see otherwise). If I need to bring an admin into this, I will. Because in my opinion: it's a content dispute between me and TJ, as no one else seems to care much about ONE LITTLE crufty thing. Slick returned for ONE appearance, post it on the Slick article and leave it at that.  
I could find more if I tried, that was in a quick 1 minute search. I could flip it and say only you think it should be removed. I don't see the big deal.

I agree, but I also don't agree.  There is nothing incorrect about the way that the article present Cruz's position.  Cruz specifically stated, word for word, that he supports """"marriage between one man and one woman.""""  The article quotes Cruz directly on his position.  You want to quote a reporter for CBS News, when that reporter is covering Cruz's appearance on Jay Leno's show.  The article currently quotes Cruz directly on what he said on Leno's show.  That option trumps the quoting of a reporter who wrote what he wanted to write and not what Cruz said.

After edit conflict  including with myself. (D'oh.)
The way your reply is phrased leads me to wonder...  but never mind, this could end up as an infinite regression.  Shall we just say, the inferences you draw from my statement are not the ones I recognise as my intent, or as their actual implication, so you making a corresponding complaint seems somewhat ironic.  (You also don't address my question about notification at all.)
My statement was about a) JS's actual notability being predominantly in the area of Creationism, rather than chess (and certain versions of the article veering away from this reality); and b) the motivation of that editor (indeed, every editor, at least to that point) to be writing about him at all.  That's pretty clearly related to his significance as a creationist, and not some interest in writing about about chess more generally.  An implication of a """"pretext to promote a creationist agenda"""" does not appear to correlate with what I said at all.  (What I had in mind was more, increasing similarity to dust-jacket prose, and AA being reluctsnt to acknowledge this about his relative notabilities.)
Your """"false comparison"""" is likewise, nothing like any I was making.  JS is very notable as a Creationist, being a bucketload-selling author on such topics, as well as an internet celeb, which certainly merits an article, which in turn requires some discussion of his prowess  and distinctly lesser notability  as a chess player.  He's not so notable as a chess player that he would ordinarily have an article purely on him as such, and I see no reason to include every possible fact about him as a chess player, out of proportion to actual notability.
At any rate, if your evidence on the RFAr page stands as is, I shall feel compelled to respond to dispute your assertions about my comment.  I was rather hoping to keep out of the whole mess, personally, going as it largely does to """"does privacy policy completely trump autobiography concerns"""", about which I have opinions, but little direct involvement.  I'd like to ask you to withdraw them, or at least, to rephrase.

This page should not be speedy deleted because...   

Given that a number of Australian curators are already listed and are not the subject of dispute, there is clearly no reason why a curator, per se, can't be considered worthy of a Wikipedia entry. While Julie Robinson certainly isn't at the same level of public awareness as Betty Churcher or Brian Kennedy, her work is still significant, particularly in the field of Australian photography, which in my opinion is currently somewhat underrepresented on Wikipedia. The two exhibitions mentioned in the first paragraph where clearly of importance within that context, and as soon as I have the opportunity I intend to add a page on Century In Focus. Very briefly, that was a three-month exhibition at one of Australia's most important public galleries, accompanied by a large-format book that was distributed by Thames & Hudson. Ms Robinson spent years working on it, as the head of a team of curators. As Sebastian Smee, himself a Pulitzer Prize winner, put it: """"If you are at all interested in Australian photography, whether or not you are from SA, you will want to see this show, or at least get hold of the catalogue.""""

Dpmuk has mentioned elsewhere that """"None of the sources are about her and there is no other indication of notability."""" I don't dispute that they are, in fact, about her work, but I don't believe that makes the page invalid. It was never intended to be an in-depth discussion of her personal history or background, but instead is meant to provide a way for people to find out more about her work, which, I'll reiterate, is certainly of importance. Exhibitions are an important part of our public culture – they inspire and educate – and as such they fully deserve to be written about.

There would obviously be no place for mention of the other exhibitions that Ms Robinson has curated in the page on Candid Camera or Century in Focus, so removing the page, while perhaps making Wikipedia more compliant and slightly tidier in dpmuk's view, will also remove what was always intended as a hub for people to learn more about art and photography in Australia. Personally, I don't know enough to add entries for all of the other exhibitions she has curated, but I'd like to think that, in time, they too will have their own pages, and the page currently in question will still be here to serve as a hub for further discovery.

Hello! I reject this ridiculous proposal to justify Trump's bigotry. Saying that """"Roosevelt did it too"""" is not going to wash. Roosevelt's internment of the Japanese is one of the most deplorable aspects of his presidency, and your suggestion that Muslims should be interned or that we are similarly at war with Muslims as we were with Nazi Germany is reprehensible.

 Trump's ethnic cleansing 

George Will, notable Conservative pundit, is the one whose view is that Donald Trump has proposed ethnic cleansing. I would never myself express an opinion in an encylopedia article. I merely voted that we add Will's highly notable opinion. This is in reference to his deportation plan of over 20 million Mexican-Americans, over half of whom were born here. Considering the amount of force one would require to deport 20 million human beings (hint:the military would most certainly be required), Will is by no means wrong or expressing an idiosyncratic view in accusing Trump of advocating ethnic cleansing, or a forcible homogenization of the population. Ethnic cleansing need not imply that Trump has promised to kill anyone, only that he has promised to """"make America more ethnically homogenous again"""", by force. Have a pleasant day.

@ Dramatic: I agree with your comment. In NZ, because people don't have a pedigree as the British upper class do, they use different paramenters to define status. The whole """"which school did you go to"""" and ESPECIALLY """"which boat did you arrive on"""" is particularly Christchurch. I can't comment on Auckland since i've never lived there, although they seem to model themselves on Sydney. In Wellington power certainly trumps money, although the money aspect of our class system still exists in Wellington. 121.73.7.84 """                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,0

Agree with all that is said above. 
It may be hard for you to detect it from the noob's point of view, but the entire process may lead to the deletion (temporarily) of the current version, followed by the creation offstage of a new, cleaner and crisper article about you, purged of the promotional efforts of your publishers and the naive but well-intentioned efforts of yourself and your supporters. I have discussions like this all the time with people stunned to learn that when I'm in my melanti as Wikipedian, my political, spiritual, literary and aesthetic opinions are rapidly trumped by Wikipedia's rules and principles, which as you have recognized constitute a flawed, human effort to bring order (but not too much order) to this effort of ours to portray a chaotic and crowded universe. Mayhap you will end up creating an article about the whole thing, for some poetic or academic journal: Should I Have Been Deleted?: Held Hostage at the Hands of the Savage Wikipedians! Or perhaps your muse will help you turn the experience into poetry, mutating frustration into art once more.  | Talk """                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,0

Hi Colin, it is good to hear from you!! I have had a lot of real life stuff piling up lately and haven't had a lot of time to contribute lately. I took a look at the Rubella article. According to several articles I was able to dig up, epidemic Rubella has been eliminated from the US.  (by Stanley  Plotkin no less) and . This article is also quite clear on the matter. Whether this woman really had rubella and where she got it are not clear from the """"podcast"""" and neither is a Podcast a reliable source. I guess  what I am saying is that I think RS must trump unverifiable trivia at every turn. Would you like for me to change it, or post a comment on the talk page?

Oh polio, my dear friend polio... I am not sure what to do with her. I think that the recent changes Marco made have really helped, but I am not sure that it fulfills the 1a requirements? I would like to take her to FA at some point but I am really busy right now, maybe in a few weeks I will take it to task, so if you might have a chance to look at it and give me your thoughts that would be quite helpful. 

I dunno what happened to Marco?? (Picturing my self wandering around a swimming pool with my eyes closed here) I will give an email shout if I don't hear anything soon, just to make sure he hasn't given up or anything. 
Wrt to Rubella. I'd appreciate it if you were bold and edited the article, mentioning the talk page in an edit summary, and explained there the difference between eliminated and eradicated. I'll back you up if necessary. °Talk """                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,0
"""=Sexism in MGS5, relevant to an encyclopedic entry on the game?===
Came back to this article to see if any progress had been made on cleaning it up. Good to see some progress has been made.
I'm going to make a few points here and well.. hopefully people will be rationale and objective about it.

Misinformation. This article is rife with it. It's incredibly important for an encyclopedia to present accurate information. An encyclopedia should not be an opinion column, it should not overly represent any opinion since they are not based on fact, nor relevant to a topic. I'm going to start with the 'Sexualized Portrayal of Quiet' and sadly I'm going to have to tear it apart. Please put how you feel about it or any emotion you may have about the topic aside when you read the following points;

1 - No other character in any other Metal Gear title pages is given this amount of scrutiny. Quiet has been highlighted by the media as sexist, this is true. However this is not a reason for an encyclopedic entry to focus on a given character. The page is not a study of the media's (or anyone else's) reaction to Quiet as a character. There should be balance in the reception section, giving a whole section to Quiet versus no other characters is not balanced.

2 - Misinformation. """"Michael McWhertor criticized Quiet's portrayal, pointing out that while the game explains that her nakedness derives from a photosynthetic skin condition, several other characters with the same condition — such as Code Talker in The Phantom Pain and The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater — appear fully clothed.""""

Regardless of the source of information, if it is incorrect information it should not be in the entry. Quiet is naked because her lungs were burnt to a crisp, the game specifically mentions this and other fans have mentioned it on the page I believe. Code Talker and The End have the same ability correct, but they did not get set on fire and thrown out of a building. I'm really baffled this is in here because McWhertor is not an authority on this whatsoever. Kojima and the game writers are. Source it correctly or remove the information I would have said.

3 - Opinion columns. This baffles me. Why are opinion pieces been taken as reception? They are not professional video game reviewers. By the media's own admission they are just someone writing their opinion about something, it's not objective. They wouldn't even claim to be unbiased as it's an opinion. You are introducing bias here by taking an opinion and presenting it for no reason other than to say """"this person didn't like Quiet's portrayal"""". If tomorrow Donald Trump wrote an opinion piece on Quiet for a media outlet, is that relevant to an encyclopedic entry about something?

4 - Further irrelevant information. There are sources and information here that talk about the PlayArtsKai figurine of Quiet. Are you out of your mind?! What relevance does this have to the RECEPTION OF THE GAME??? The video game this entry is about. To start with PlayArtsKai is a completely separate company that we have no idea or information about how much Hideo Kojima was involved with. One would assume since they are completely different companies ENTIRELY that Konami simply licensed the intellectual property rights of Quiet to PlayArtsKai. It goes without saying but Twitter is not a valid source of information.

5 - Dates. Numerous sources are reactions to the character Quiet and precede the date of release. Thus they are not a reception of the game itself. Hence why are they in a section called """"Reception"""" to start with.

5 - Forbes contributors and Anita Sarkeesian. We seem to have established that Forbes contributors are not valid sources so I expect this will be okay to remove.

Everything else seems to be sourced from valid sources who are professional video game reviewers. Although again I'd suggest that Quiet is getting an amazing amount of spotlight in the article for no other reason than controversy 

To any senior editors, administrators, or anyone with an interest in Wikipedia standards. It should be extremely concerning that this level of bias is present in an article that is supposed to be by and large, factual. 86.40.28.221

Diacritics: Moving forward

I too have no very clear idea about how to word an RfC, other than that it should be in relation to specific proposed changes to the MOS and not something vaguer. I also think it's very important to keep to the issue of diacritical marks in the original orthography of the language, and not stray into either additional letters (like eth or thorn) or the use of diacritical marks in transcription/transliteration (like retaining accents when going from πότε to póte or marking long vowels by macrons in transliterating a number of languages, including Greek and Japanese). These are separate issues.

The problems, for me, are primarily in the first paragraph of WP:DIACRITICS, which is evasive, muddled and inconsistent:
 – this is just evasion. Their use or non-use should be motivated, and hence should be encouraged or discouraged according to the strength of the motivation.
 – this encouragement to count """"hits"""" just results in muddled policy, apart from the problem of the weasel word """"general"""". However, this bit seems clear that the """"modifications"""" are to the same word, i.e. can be treated as stylistic modifications.
 This seems to me not to be consistent with the sentence before: is """"the common name"""" here supposed to be with or without the added diacritical marks? """"[V]ersions of  word"""" above should mean that """"the common """" is the same with or without the diacritical marks.
Is it possible to re-write this paragraph to achieve consensus? I don't know.   

 Agreed those are separate issuesAgreed the first quoted passage is evasive, but motivating use or avoidance of diacritics seems to be the sticking point.  Did you have some particular direction in mind?  My take has been that if reliable sources show that their use is normal for the names in question that they should be used here, except where particular subjects eschew them. E.g. for a baseball player named Eddie Sandoval we'd give him as Eddie Sándoval if some reliable sources did (it can't be based on a majority of English language sources, since majority of them ignore diacritics entirely, as a matter of editorial/publishing convenience). It's the same principle that we can cite a single source for Eddie's birth date and place even if most sources don't mention them.  A fact does not have to be provided by every single source to be considered reliable.  And it's not a matter of sources conflicting (analogous to giving two different birth dates); some giving only Sandoval without the diacritics is like some sources giving a birth year but not a full birth date; it is incomplete information, not conflicting information.  On the other hand, if Eddie himself is quoted saying he doesn't use the diacritic that should be a trumping factor (unless WP totally ditches subject preference in all areas, which seems unlikely given the number of discussions going on to make more allowances for subject preference all over the place).  This can apply to geography, too (Santa Fe, New Mexico is """"Santa Fe"""" not """"Santa Fé"""" despite the popularity of the diacritic in certain circles; the official name of both the city and the county are """"Santa Fe"""" with no accent. People frequently cite WP:OFFICIALNAME as if it were a policy, but it's actually just an essay, it may not accurately reflect the nuances in cases like this, and people often cite it without actually understanding what it says to begin with (it's frequently misinterpreted as being against use of official names, when it's really only against using them when they're directly unhelpful to readers, while otherwise we would almost certainly use the official name)I'm not sure """"general"""" in the second passage is actually a weasel word, rather than just lack of clarity.  It's not clear if it means the predominant use in reliable sources generally, the predominant use in general-audience sources, or both.  The inclusion of """"and reference works"""" strongly suggests the former.

I'm sorry to disagree but, at Wikipedia, secondary sources trump primary sources.  This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing """"original research"""" based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means """"a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process"""".  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing """"original research"""".  All we can say is """"Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.""""  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say """"Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.""""  There is still room to debate how reliable """"published author Y"""" is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of """"Published author Y"""".  The basic principle here is """"not published => not reliable"""".  And self-published doesn't count.    18:09"""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,0

Citation should not be needed on the point about Gamespot being originally a PC gaming site.  Being a Gamespot user myself since 1996!

The picture featuring the Gamespot Portal should probably be updated.

unlock it and list me as a key part of the mod staff o_O 

I think the sock puppet invasion is over. It's probably safe to reopen it. 

I don't see any disputes, it was just a sock puppet invasion. I think it's time to reopen this 01:35, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC) Gateman1997

On a serious note, will it get deleted if I list myself as a key mod on the GS staff? I really am a mod, and one of the mods you listed isn't even a mod anymore. I would consider taking off the mod who's not even a mod anymore and adding myself to be a legit update. 

I remember they locked the IGN topic once, and it was there for several days. 

Once this page is fully open, would anyone mind a total rewrite that would cover everything about GameSpot ever? 

Um, how exactly are you goiong to list yourself? Do you mean saying your real-life name or your user ID that you use here? If you can provide a link or something showing you're really on the staff, then... maybe. Talk 10:41, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

It's so stupid that anyone would vandalise a page becuase they are angry at the site. 

 Come on - let it be edited! 
I want to add some more details about GameSpot. When is it going to be unlocked by a SYSOP?  1 July 2005 17:06 (UTC)

Well, my name at GameSpot is The_Capitalist, and if this topic ever opens, I'll rewrite the topic. Is anyone planning to contact a Wikipedia mod? 

Um, go to the protected list and say it should be unlocked. Often the sysops just forget if no-one demands it! So do that and it'll no doubt become open very soon. Talk 5 July 2005 04:19 (UTC)

I went to the list of protected pages, but GameSpot wasn't listed. I believe that they thought they had re-opened the page, but I guess they did not. I've alerted a wikimod to the situation. - XX55XX/The Capitalist  

The protection logs said it was protected against vandalism. Since it has been protected for almost a full month, I have unprotected it. Next time, ask for unprotection on Wikipedia:Requests for page protection.  5 July 2005 21:54 (UTC)

Someone should mentiion that both gamespot and videogamespot started out as nuke.com.. it was an online presence of EGM.. they opted for gamespot name several issues later..

 One small thing 
""""GameSpot is credited with being one of the most reliable and sometimes brutally honest resources for gaming information in the Internet, leading in reviews, previews, and news coverage""""
Any sources for this? 

Read some reviews, the people at Gamespot are pretty tough. 

Anyone I know regards them as the opposite, according the gamerankings they are purely average.  

That's purely anecdotal evidence, which is useless. Go pick up a game box sometime. The developers love quoting positive reviews from Gamespot and IGN  

While it may be POV, me and everybody I know certainly believes it to be true.  

I actually don't see as many gamers trumpeting Gamespot's reviews on thier boxes as you would have us believe. I believe your opinion is just that.

I agree, it should be reworded as 'Many people see gamespot as the most brutally honest... etc... etc.. etc..', this article is full of POV information, a definite rewrite should be in order. Besides, it doesn't matter if you've been a member of GameSpot since ever, or if you even work there; the writing standards of Wikipedia still apply.  

I would hardly describe Gamespot's 6.3 out of ten review of"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,0
"""::That assumes a cladistic understanding of taxonomy, doesn't it?  By that standard, """"reptiles"""" can't be considered a group without including birds, since crocodiles and birds diverged more recently than crocodiles and turtles.  Mammals might have to be included as well.  While understanding the order of speciation is certainly very important, I'm not sure why this should be assumed to trump the more standard way of classifying animals.  00:12, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)

You are simply wrong. Here is what you inserted in the article: Remarkably, this was the first time he had ever performed in that country.

Your edit to Matt Bevin claimed that the information provided was """"biased"""". It's not """"biased"""" to tell the blatant truth. Matt Bevin was criticized for lying about his position on health care – there's no pretty way to say it. If the statement is deleted, like you had done, then it's hiding the truth, or whitewashing. Whitewashing is dishonesty and deception, which is unbecoming of a civilized person. Also, the way you phrased, """"...to stop putting people on Obamacare"""" sounds like a 10 year old wrote it – if you're going to edit articles, please use proper grammar (in other words, don't write the same way that Donald Trump talks).

I wanted to let you know that I just reverted essentially all of the content you added to Tone Trump. In my opinion the way you wrote about him was overly-promotional and didn't reflect the neutral point of view that is expected in Wikipedia articles.

I do hope you will continue to contribute to that article, and lots of others, but please do bear in mind the need to write in a neutral voice.

Cheers,

 Requested move 

Female genital cutting →  – This may be a polarized issue, but most Wikipedia name request changes are. Female genital mutilation is by far the most commonly used term in Academic, Legal, Medical, and Non-Governmental circles, and thus conforms to WP:COMMONNAME. It has been suggested that the current name is an amicable compromise as per WP:NPOV, however this is not a proper implementation of that policy. WP:NPOV is not a trump-card for WP:COMMONNAME for use by those people who for one reason or another disagree with the wording of the most common name. Wikipedia in fact has a policy specifically for pages such as this, WP:POVTITLE, which has not been followed in this case (text included below). Lastly, to keep the current name is to give undue weight (WP:UNDUE) to the people who disagree with the term Female genital mutilation, we must remember that Wikipedia is about what is verifiable and sourced and not what one or more member's opinion on an issue is. There is no debate in the relevant literature over whether female circumcision is in fact mutilation, and Wikipedia should reflect the consensus achieved in verifiable and authoritative sources. 

WP:POVTITLE: """"When a significant majority of English-language reliable sources all refer to the topic or subject of an article by a given name, Wikipedia should follow the sources and use that name as our article title (subject to the other naming criteria). Sometimes that common name will include non-neutral words that Wikipedia normally avoids (Examples include Boston Massacre, Rape of Belgium, and Teapot Dome scandal). In such cases, the commonality of the name overrides our desire to avoid passing judgment (see below). This is acceptable because the non-neutrality and judgment is that of the sources, and not that of Wikipedia editors. True neutrality means we do not impose our opinions over that of the sources, even when our opinion is that the name used by the sources is judgmental.""""

Knowledgebattle certainly know that User talk:ReliableBen just made a manipulative statement, when you said, """"ZChN does not exist."""" By simply saying, """"does not exist"""", it leaves out the fact that it did, and that the political ideology still lingers. Racism didn't die in the US after the slaves were freed; the ZChN ideology doesn't die just because the party has all but disbanded. The party that many of them went on to, Polska Jest Najważniejsza, is in fact nationalist, as the name, itself, makes clear. And from there, Polska Razem. Being Rightist conservatives, it's no wonder he just made the same kind of comment that one would expect from Donald Trump: """"Everyone must realise how big a mistake it was to attempt to relocate groups of Muslim immigrants in Poland."""" When Christians bomb something or attack someone, no Christians assert that anyone should kick the Christians out of the country, or that it's a mistake to let Christians live in their country. The man is anti-Semetic (in regard toward both Jews and Muslims). He's making that very clear.

But why? We have multiple reliable sources that can be used (and they have the added bonus of actually being right). I would think that two (different) reliable sources that say otherwise would trump a single source. -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,0
"Welcome to Wikipedia. I'm sorry that you're annoyed by Wikipedia's rules on what we do and we don't allow in our articles. It's nothing personal - it can't be with thousands of articles created by hundreds of editors every day.

The articles you created were deleted by various people for various reasons. Bill Dudley (trumpeter), when you first created it, didn't assert notability for the subject.  nominated it for deletion and I deleted it. You recreated the article but used sales language;  nominated it for deletion and  deleted it because we don't allow advertising. The New Orleanians had the line You can catch The New Orleanians on stage every Sunday from 5pm to 8pm at the Strawberry Hills Hotel - clear advertising; Wheelchair Epidemic nominated it for deletion, NawlinWiki deleted it.

By this time, editors were spotting a pattern to your edits: low notability subjects being written about with advertising terms in them. So Strawberry Hills Hotel was proposed for deletion by Wheelchair Epidemic, Ecoleetage agreed and NawlinWiki deleted it. David Ridyard didn't assert notability;  nominated it for deletion, Wheelchair Epidemic agreed and NawlinWiki deleted it. Adrian Ford didn't assert notability;  nominated it and I deleted it. You recreated it, again without asserting notability,  noted that it read like advertising, Stijndon nominated it again and NawlinWiki deleted it.

:Category:Australian Jazz Bands was deleted by NawlinWiki because it wasn't a category - it was a list.

You're welcome to recreate any of these articles, but you need to say clearly and upfront why they are notable enough to be included and provide a reliable, third-party source for any such claim. You also need to make sure that you're not using Wikipedia to advertise the subject in any way. Hope this helps. ➨ REDVERS in a car - no brakes?

 The best response is no response? 

It seems that every time i try to talk to anybody around here, things end up deleted or changed. Chronic problem. At least this time
it was actually apparently you who did it. Nice change.
Are you just going to delete and ignore the people who are trying to
get you to see the problems that exist? How about fixing the problems?

Your social experiment can't work under the weight of political warfare. Abuse is rampant, the abused have no real recourse. Gaming the system is too simple, and enough people are doing it that it is now part of what is simply required to be here. You don't have a creative or collaborative encyclopedia; You have a psycholigcal war
zone.

What are you going to do about it?
My suggestion, as an Expert in Sociology, Psychology, Systems Theory,
Communications Theory, And Political Science is that The problem stems from the sheer quantity of ignorant pov warriors versus the smaller number of available experts, and the techniques and tactics that can be employed against reason, fact, knowledge, ot sense.
I see the same problem Larry Sanger Saw, But i know that the solution isn't to become elitist, it is instead to create interactions that are meritocratic instead of based in pack psychology and mob or riot group movements.

LOGIC, which is what ANY serious educational or informational
service has to eventually use, is the only solution to your
problems. Logic ends most of the tools used by pack psychology, ends psychological warfare tactics, exposes ignorance and lies and misinformation, as well as bad reasoning, and levels the playing feild enough so that an Expert has a chance to actually confront that mob.

Unless you ban me, or I am blocked, I'll continue to attempt to talk with you about this problem, and it will start to pop up in as many places as i looks like it needs in order to get the attention it deserves. Avoidance isn't going to solve the problems, and, to be truthful, blocking me is only getting rid of the one thing that could have bailed you out; A lucid whos Agenda is to help you write the best encylopedia ever; who nonetheless understands the facts of the entropy you are experiencing and who knows how to deal with it and what the solutions to those problems are.

It will be better for you, and for everybody concerned, if you adress
the problems, and work with those who are capable of being lucid relevant to those problems to solve those problems. Unless your goal
is to have entropy and pack psychology dominate the world, and to be yet one more example of how politics and pack psychology enforce intentional ignorance and doublethink propagandas.

Lets start with square one. Knowledgable experts ought to be able to as much as float an outline on a talk page without having it deleted by pov warriors whos agenda is to keep the conversation in drama.
People who are seriously abused by others ought to have realistic and swift recourse regarding that abuse. People should not be allowed to stack RFCs with their freinds. People should not be allowed to stack votes for deletion with their freinds. People should not be allowed to attack others and then cite them for personal attacks if they as much as respond with a simple mirrored reflection of the original attack. Pov warriors should not have pet rogue admins blocking people on trumped up charges to silence them
for making noise about serious abuses. Wikipedia should not be psychological combat. And Yet, it is.

Since it vanished into the ethers, lets recap the more angry
and to the point message you failed to answer.

Wikipedia IS evil
[23]

It is host to the same big political groupthink game that goes on in all of the rest of civilization. It is a battleground for propaganda warfare, a lawless game in which anything can be said as long as its in """"neutral"""" language even if its a propagandists lie, and even if it exists only to dispute a known fact. It is a place notable mostly for what it conspicuously lacks. There are in general thousands of articles which tell us about as much as a High Schooler might, and which then devolve into factoids and rhetoric. The expertise of depth knowledge is missing. No expert would submit themselves to a situation of patent pack psychology informational riot. Wikipedia is Evil. And You, Jimbo Wales, are the guy who created it. Maybe you should try some Formal Logic in the mix. Maybe this """"Randian"""" Environment could use some controls on its chaos vectors. Maybe even a realistic and functional methodology for dealing with abuse might be in order.

Nice graphic box at the top of the page says to go post at the admin desk,. Funny, i tried that, and got less than no result.

 The ONLY worthwhile candidate. 

It's true. Gravel is the only presidential candidate not spouting out the usual political BS (as well as Ron Paul). It only figures that he's receiving little to no attention. His accomplishments in the 60's and 70's with the War and the Pentagon Papers trumps the accomplishments of every other candidate, but that scumbag Giuliani is revered for his """"actions"""" during 9/11. It's so depressing...ugh. This only justifies my cynicism even more. The majority of Americans are content with accepting the same garbage every election. If Clinton wins, that will mean for 24 years, the most powerful country in the world was controlled by two differen families. Disgusting.

"I'm okay with that. Per Wikipedia:Redirect#What needs to be done on pages that are targets of redirects, it should be mentioned in the lead and bolded. There is also the Wikipedia:Article titles#Treatment of alternative names policy for synonyms (although not all synonyms are mentioned in the lead, either because they are one of several or many and should rather be covered lower in the article or because they are offensive and/or unencyclopedic; while there is Wikipedia:NOTCENSORED and it is a policy, it can be trumped by the Wikipedia:Offensive material guideline, seeing as even Wikipedia:NOTCENSORED mentions that offensive material shouldn't be included just for the sake of including it).

 Identify Y, partial Y, U-turn hybrid interchange 

Copied from User talk:Chaswmsday#Name of intersection:
 
What's that kind of interchange? Is there a name for it?

Technically this is a grade separated HIGH-T / CGT / Seagull or sealed trumpet?* 27.552055,-82.562985 US-19 / US-41* 39.077387,-108.576782 US-50 / US-6it can also be found at I-10 to I-20 intersection next to west end of Texas.   End copy.   

Hans, to my eyes these very interesting interchanges appear to be hybrids of full Y's, partial Y's, a little bit of trumpet interchange, and with U-turn ramps like the """"interchanges with U-turns"""" described in this'' article. They sort of """"do"""" look like a grade-separated version of seagull intersections except that whichever highway you pretend is the """"top bar of the T"""", the left entrance ramp merges onto that roadway before the left exit ramp departs. I'm not sure they're a common-enough type to have their own name, other than just describing them as hybrid-""""somethings"""". Does anyone else here have an opinion? Thanks.

""":::::::: Not really. For one thing, being on the cutting edge means you're on the wrong side of the knife...  For the second, that's actually how Wikipedia works. We always """"follow"""", often at a good distance, behind what RS say. We never lead the way with new information, including scientific discoveries. Good science is conservative, and so is Barrett and QW. When new medical knowledge is established, QW articles get updated. Some which are outdated may not even exist anymore, or they have been revised to include new data. That's the proper way to do things. If QW were to trumpet new knowledge too  quickly, they would often end up having to backtrack, because most new knowledge ends up being a false lead that proves to be a disappointment. That's exactly what quacks do, and make money by selling such poorly supported """"new"""" knowledge. Barrett knows better than to do that.

"it is truly amazing how many ill-educated racists support Trump. Friends, if you would spend half the time pursuing an education and bettering yourself as you spend fawning over your Fuhrer and purchasing stupid hats with concealed racist slogans on them, your life would be much better, and you would not need to turn demagogues to feel better about your sorry lot in life. Chin up, friend!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,0

RfC Response
Got here randomly from listing of RfCs on Community Page, but do have some academic background in sexual behavior. Have to say that aside from the first few paragraphs as I found them, which were good, this article is substantially tainted with junk and pseudo-science designed to legitimize or de-stigmatize male on female rape. Just because someone with initials after their name managed to get something published, or posted something on the net, does not make it good science. """"Encyclopedic"""" should mean both """"known and recognized as good""""   and """"comprehensive""""; but """"known good"""" should always trump """"comprehensive"""".  The vandalism (e.g. """"more pictures"""") is also out of hand. There is also way too much plain and simple error (e.g. discussion of sex and aggression in other species falls in the realm of Comparative Psychology, not Sociology). I think you need to request major intervention by moderators on this topic.

3 editors making an incorrect point do not trump 1 editor making a correct point.  That just demonstrates that Erin Burnett has at least 3 fans who are willing to edit her Wikipedia page by ignoring Wiki standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,0

Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello, Wikid77 here. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:
 """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.
 """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.
 """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.
 """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.
 """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.
I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text.

Oppose per WP:PROT and WP:OWN. Both of these trump a proposal that hasn't even achieved consensus support yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,0

It's a Simpsons reference, you tard

""""Keep reaching for that rainbow"""" is a sarcastic statement based on an old episode of a TV show, that has been in use on the Internet for ten years now. It has nothing to do with your homosexuality, of which I was not aware until you saw fit to bring it up. I did not hunt around your profile page trying to find out your sexual proclivities. This sort of autistic obsession with missing the tone of everything and construing things as personal attacks when they clearly are not is the exact sort of bullshit that makes Wikipedia such a useless morass of drama. (By the way, THIS is a personal attack.)

The nonsense on the NAC page is atrocious. The fucking thing was gutted by the ex-wife of the person who the page is about. All attempts to fix her obviously COI censorship have been blocked, so the page remains as an advertisement with fifteen warning boxes at the top. Your tangential involvement with the NAC in the past does not trump the fact that experts in the field (people who actually are leaders in the quizbowl community) have worthwhile opinions and facts to add to the article."""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,0

 I am completely convinced now! You are most certainly a paid propagandist who's sole goal on wikipedia is the integral protection of Yugoslavs and Yugoslav historiography. Hilariously enough, one needs to spend years studying the complexity of NDH in order to get the correct picture - what you do not have and will never have because of your balkan irrationality and politically fueled interest in such a topic and the surrounding topics. I really do wish I had the time and energy to flip this all around, site sources - and become more familiar with wikipedia itself - but I do not. I have trumped you in almost every single section of argument - point for point. But you still continue and you have even removed things that I have written on discussion pages within long periods of time where I am not visibly present. I would probably do the same if someone like myself was embarrassing me intellectually in the way that I embarrass you. Stipe Mesic used NDH rhetoric several times in several countries to benefit his and the HDZ's political platform. If you are going to sit here and say that the memory of NDH had nothing to do with the creation of the modern Croatian state - well then you're lying to yourself and everyone else. The entire political emigration was founded upon the tradition of NDH. The modern wave of Croatian nationalism was the idea of national reconciliation between sons of Ustase and Partizani. That's in HDZ's original political platform. Tudman had to appeal to all Croatians - that's why you Tito lovers got to parade around with the false idea of antifascism at a time when the Croatian lobby couldn't combat 60 years of communist propaganda and the Serb wartime propaganda machine that was screaming - Tudman = Pavelic, look at the flag, look at the currency! I personally witnessed Stipe Mesic playing the NDH card. He is an opportunist. He was even caught singing """"Jure i Boban"""". Coincidence ?  Of course not. It was to his political benefit. He also left Tudman's side to shake hands with Croatia's political right in their smear campaign against Tudman himself. That's right, Stipe Mesic at HSP rallies years before Anto Djapic and the HSP denounced the Ustasa Movement or Dr. Pavelic. Look at Djapic now... There's another great example. 15 years ago he was Ustasa number one. In recent years, European pressure has made it unfavorable - so now he sings a different tune. That's the best part. All these people are the biggest balkan chameleons who use these catch themes to fool all the little balkanites into ignoring real problems in the country. That is how NDH is relevant. However, your side has done so well in the creation of this so-called antifascism, that 'pro-NDHers' if you will can only 'fight back' by pointing out communist crimes. Jasenovac Vs Bleiburg isn't really Jasenovac Vs Bleiburg, its Ustasa historiography Vs Partizan historiography. Most people in Croatia sympathize with one side or the other - you know that, and I know that. You can sit here and throw out fallacies, fact is fact, Stipe Mesic at one point in time glorified the tenth of April and sang Ustasa songs. That is a fact. Dr. Pavelic was allied with the Axis, that is a fact. He later in his emigre days distanced himself and his movement from the Nazis and formed a Croatian Democratic movement (HOP). They're politicians !   """,0

Thank you for proving me right some more."""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,0
"As I stated above, the licensure facts as I stated them are verifiable in Attachment Therapy on Trial (ISBN 027597675), pp. 44-45.  So the claim may have been made in good faith, but so is the correction.  Since my secondary source (which is peer-reviewed, professionally edited, and from a reputable publisher) takes its facts from the trial transcript, and it specifically relates this matter, it trumps the tertiary sources cited above.

"""
I believe people do not change, and that a person's perspective is an innate and unchanging element of the soul, which is created and raised by the material circumstances of a person's existence. An """"artificial soul"""", in the words of Dickens' Mr Bumble. There is no """"convincing"""" anyone of anything. It is simply impossible. Either people understand, or they do not. That's the way the world has always worked. 
Regardless, there is no obligation to be friendly (this is not a """"social media""""). Certain people are worth ignoring, and the fellow that started this inquisition is one of those people. I am perfectly within my power to remove his comments from my page. I do not believe that he was acting in good faith. I simply do not. He wasn't, quite clearly. He was attempting to remove an obstacle, and he succeeded. It is all a matter of strategy. We must assume good faith, but that doesn't mean we must be ignorant of bad faith. I find it hard to believe you can block me for """"harassment"""" when I've never engaged with this editor, at all. I refused to do so. If anything, his behaviour was harassment.

"Socking and edit warring is not the answer==
I just wanted to put a note here, for folks who are apparently so angry that Wikipedia says there are <9000 jews in Iran that they are opening    (all blocked) in order to make it not say that, and folks curious about it.   I suggest the socking user find more constructive ways of contributing - there are many.  I think the consensus view is that we're not being arbitrary and we're not censoring; we have articles that say it had more Jews and are open to having articles report that Iran has far more Jews than the articles now say it has, provided it is verifiable to a source that trumps the actual, official, recent government census.  This has been discussed here and elsewhere, including talk pages linked to from this section (that is, #Iran).  The claims of a larger presence could be noted if, for example, there are verifiable sources that say that the numbers do not include significant numbers of Crypto-Jews living in Iran. (t•c)

"Personally I'd have nothing there (i.e. no space or comma) but the MoS trumps me, I guess.  I was mostly confused because it was in a table, and I was worried that this was a mysterious fourth column that had become misplaced.  It's much clearer now; thanks for solving the mystery for me.   03:12, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,0

 This is why Wikipedia is a joke and can never be trusted. 

It is extremely silly for Wikipedia to label a male transvestite as a """"she."""" It is impossible to change one's sex, you idiotic communist pieces of shit. Science trumps your bizarre fundamentalist socialist religion. Stop enabling people who suffer from gender identity disorder. It is harmful to their health.

I fully expect to be maligned as """"transphobic"""" or some other such nonsense for speaking the truth, because that is common tactic you people use to silence your critics."""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,1

Trumpet, I certainly will let someone whose posts mainly consist of inaccuracies, insults, ignoring/misrepresenting others views and """"zombies"""" tell me how I should refert to this fringe group.
I don't care whether you are a JMer, but the rest of your comment reveals that you have no idea about the historical craft. 
Since you have been explained about Docetism, there's no use in repeating why it and the JesusMyth claim are different. You will not listen.

"It would seem that you're just guessing about copyright infringement. I also think I clearly have more legal knowledge than you in this instance and that it is fair to say that my hypothesis trumps yours. Your arguments are flimsy and sound like they're mostly preference arguments that coincide with your opinions. This is becoming a bit absurd. I'm sure you know what that word means. At the end of the day, you probably just don't -like- the video, so you whine and snivel and fight to remove it.

I don't think your image should replace it because from the talkpage and from your nom on FPC it seems that it has questionable value as a sunset image. Therefore it makes much more sense to replace the existing image (which I'll do now) with one showing a similar situation but in higher quality. Oh and in terms of being """"first in"""" I think I top trump you with a replacement I tried about 14 months ago! )  """                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,0
"Saxophone: Kings of Jazz 

The saxophone is a new instrument to the musical world in terms of time. In the specific realm of jazz is the ring leader of the genre, with the close second being the trumpet. Can you really argue with the fact that the sax has changed jazz in it's entirty, from swing to bop, to samba, to fusion and modern. Charlie Parker revolutionized jazz by playing the sax with a classical ensamble. Stan Getz led the short but very important samba movement with his smooth style and grace on his tenor sax. Michael Brecker, who recntly died of a rare form of Lukemia ( i think), was a beast of a player that revolutionized modern jazz. And then there's Jimmy Picket from Tower of Power who brought sax to the funk style.

dear Mr Manjunath, i was mearely trying to point out to Mr Pompus whoever he is, that other dravidian speakers, especially Kannada speakers have had their great empires too and that Tamils are not the only empire builders.

Precisely, you were trying to trumpet Kannada achievements at the cost of that article which had a totally different angle. Your modifications made the article completely absurd. Your narrow minded hatred against Tamils has only succeeded in vandalizing the article.

Secondly, Kannada speakers did not start their litreary traditions """"very late"""". they started their traditions """"later"""". please correct your english and see the difference in wording.

Thank you for the correction. Probably, that was the only change you had to make and you succeeded in totally distorting the article.

This was because they were ruled by prakrit speakers in the north and hence Kannnada did not get the official recognition as early as tamil. This again has to do with geographical proximity. Please be aware of this. Just because the satahahanas encouraged Prakrit does not mean Kannada speakers did not speak Kannada, they just had to abide by officialdom given to Prakrit thats all, just like tulu spearkers todays have to abide by Kannada being the official language.

Totally irrelevent to the topic at hand. Anyway, the studies on Dravidian languages is still ongoing process. If the present studies are correct, the regions of Andhra and Karnataka spoke Dravidian language earlier than the region of Tamil Nadu. Probably, that makes Proto-Kannada older than Proto-Tamil. But that does not deny the fact that South India was referred as Dravida and not Karnata. The article was a mere compliation of the records that talked about Dravida and its association with South India.

I dont see this issue out of place. Just as Mention of early tamils kingdoms is valid, so is the mention of Kannada kigndoms to show that speakers of other dravidian languages have had their time in the sun too. Get off your high Tamil horse.

This was the same reason I said you have not understood the content of the article. It was neither a propaganda to project Tamils nor to denigrate Kannadigas. It's just a mere exposition how Dravida represented whole of South (and that included Gujarat and Maharashtra where the only Dravidian influence was that of Kannada kingdoms in the later period).

I speak Kannada with my mother. Therefore, I consider myself a Kannadiga. Thanks for your personal attacks. Makes me proud of my Kannadaness.

Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the current captain of India, who has only played Test cricket for three years, and is ranked about 30th in the world for batting and is criticised regualrly for making too many unforced errors with ball-catching, has 170-odd incoming links and 8 interwiki links because of recentism and the fact that every modern cricket series/tournament has its own page and the player lists link to him everywhere. If they ranked the players in the last 100 years Dhoni would not even be ranked in the top 200, let alone the top six like Trumper. ''''  (cricket calendar poll!'')

I'm okay with Fletcher's approach, frankly.  Yes, there are relevant qualms about calling it a """"mosque"""" since that's not all the planned center would be, but there would be facilities for holding prayers and services, and really the distinction between mosque and prayer room in this sense is a semantic distinction.  If there were a line in the first paragraph of the lead qualifying that it's not solely a mosque project and perhaps even the word """"mosque"""" isn't strictly correct, I'm okay with the use of that word in the title.  But it has to say """"near Ground Zero"""".  NickCT's comment about how WP:COMMONNAME should be the sole arbiter of this matter I think doesn't recognize that there is a spirit to the rules that trumps the letter of the rules.  Wikipedia is not a place to spread misinformation.  Calling the page """"Ground Zero Mosque"""" despite the fact that the term misrepresents where the mosque facilities will be, and despite the fact that reputable sources are choosing not to use the term because it misrepresents where the mosque facilities will be, flies in the face of the idea that we're supposed to be reflecting what the WP:RS sources are saying.

Seems to me that claiming Trump is not a typical politician is a POV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,0

Problems with the article
Apparently this is a very loose term used to distinguish people who have acquired some kind of long term fame or notoriety associated with popular culture.  Hendrix, The Beatles, Elvis, Sinatra, Crosby, Jolson, and so on might be described as """"pop icons"""" because they are strongly associated with, and in some ways personify, the zeitgeist or an era in popular culture.  This includes film and other popular art forms, and sport (De Niro, Monroe, Bogart, Muhammad Ali, Pelé).   It often includes people who died relatively young (Morrison, Hendrix, James Dean).  So far so good.

Then there are people whose work wasn't primarily in or related to popular culture, but whose image has been co-opted as a pop icon (Einstein).  Well, okay.

Now looking at the article, we see a section called """"Notable pop icons"""" comprising, presently, some forty names.  More than half of those names are sourced from a single news story based on a press release produced by a single media organisation in November, 2003. A further seven of them are base on a similar news story from a different media organisation in 2005  The criterion for the list of 100 members given in the first news story, it turns out, is a viewer's poll by a single cable television channel, VH1, from a shortlist drawn up by """"A panel of celebrities and experts – including presenter June Sarpong, newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy and GQ editor Dylan Jones.""""  Presumably the experts on the panel asked to remain anonymous.

Further examination of that single source also demonstrates that there are unexplained omissions from our list.  If we assume for the moment that membership of the VH1 list (which is biased towards the tastes and cultural memory of the British viewership of that channel) is a sign of """"pop icon"""" status, where is Princess Diana on our list?  She's number 5 on the VH1 list but completely absent from ours.  Similarly, The Simpsons (VH1: number 6) and Robbie Williams (VH1: number 9) are omitted from our list.

Looking in the opposite direction, Aerosmith is included in our list because MTV  featured the band in a program called """"MTV icons"""", but is nowhere to be seen in the VH1 100 (not surprising as the band, while not unknown in VH1's target market, isn't exactly a household name).  And while VH1 lists first man on the moon Neil Armstrong at 76, his trumpet-playing namesake Louis Armstrong (selected as one of 100 """"Icons of the Century"""" by Variety) is nowhere to be seen on VH1's chart.

There are also problems with the membership criteria of the sources.  I've already mentioned the UK bias of the VH1 list (which goes some way to explain the presence of Beckham and Robbie Williams, both household names in the UK but not so well known elsewhere). The Variety list, for  instance, sought to represent """"every side of show business"""", so relatively obscure figures such as Arthur Freed (who wrote the lyrics for Singin' in the Rain and produced many hit films) are listed as """"Icons of the Century"""".  Clearly the people on the list are there because they're """"iconic"""" in some sense, but not in the sense implied by this article.

Another thing that isn't addressed is the requirement of longevity.  Can we include Britney Spears, who a mere decade ago was an unknown with a recording contract and an audacious concept for a pop video for her debut single? Britney Spears' career has hit an air pocket, and there's no way of knowing whether her image will recover in the public mind.  Perhaps it's premature to describe this relative newcomer as a """"pop icon""""."""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,0
"The ISIS comment comes up in the first few search hits because it is CURRENT. That's how google works.  But again, compare with Donald Trump. His most recent remarks regarding Muslims and terrorist families do not warrant a separate section.

Thank you for the help. They really trumped up the charges and made up ones out of thin air. Like sock-puppeting...no proof whatsoever.

"""== Tizoc Ceballos, Composer (b.1979) Los Angeles, Ca ==

 Biography 
Tizoc is a notable American Composer of New Musichttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_20th_century_classical_composers#1970s.  At a very early age he began studying piano, and in Middle School began taking trumpet lessons at the Los Angeles Music and Arts School. There he also began taking Mariachi lessons and by age 16 was fully immersed into the Mariachi world.  Today Tizoc is privileged to have had the opportunity to play along side of some of the most talented Mariachi musicians in the world and enjoys sharing his passion for Mariachi music through teaching and performing.

While completing his undergraduate work at Chapman University, through the support of professors and his wife, Tizoc realized a passion for writing music. Tizoc’s new found excitement for composition and new music led him to participate in Chapman’s New Music and Percussion Ensembles where he began learning percussion, and expanding his exposure to 21st century music. By his second year at Chapman, Tizoc gained admission into the composition program and began studying with composers Sean Heim and Shaun Naidoo. Compositionally, Tizoc is influenced by many different kinds of music, and aspires to use music as a medium to express some of our inner most emotions and states of mind.  His music has been performances by Chapman Universities Chamber Orchestra, New Music Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble as well as The California Ear Unit.

Silent Cries (2006) -written for string ensemble
Program notes:
This piece was provoked by Mahmoud Ahmadunejad's absurd denial of the more then six million Jewish people murdered during the second world war.  Upon hearing his ridiculous denials I felt compelled to learn more about genocides around the world.  This research opened my eyes to the horror of well over 100 million innocent people exterminated due to hate and ignorance in genocides that took place throughout the modern world in the last hundred years.  The people murdered by the Nazi's in Europe during the second world war is not about numbers nor imagination, but sadly a fraction of the other genocides that took place worldwide in the 20th century, such as those in China, Japan, USSR, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Rwanda, Iraq, Aghanistan, Uganda, Bangladesh, Luberia, Sierra Leone, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Guatemala, Chad, Taiwan, Haiti, Spain, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Chile, and Argentina to name a few.

At best this should be an article about a murder, noting that Magnotta is the prime suspect.

"The only one I know much about is French Tarot, but I think the other games are similar. French Tarot is much like other trick-taking games; the tricks are won by the highest card in the suit, or if trumps are played, by the highest trump card. There is bidding, with the highest bidder becoming the taker; the taker wins the hand if he or she gets enough card points as determined by a thoroughly insane point system. t/c"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,0

"You list feminism as the prominent advocate against sexism directed at men, before men's rights.  You are arguing that the definition of equal rights for both sexes (as used in the context of one form of feminism which, the article suggests stands out mainly in its criticism of other more vocal forms of feminism) places feminism in this cell:  under those circumstances, egalitarianism trumps all movements, as its definition is entirely unambiguous.  What makes feminism more noteworthy than both egalitarianism and men's rights in this endeavor?

Thanks again for your help."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,0

I could have been """"reminded"""" too but was banned and then threatened by you in response. The policy here is often to ban first and ask questions later. I think I am just about done with Wiki. It is a laughing stock of an encyclopedia lampooned daily in the press and print world. """"The Onion, Daily Show, Colbert Report"""" have all picked on it for just the kind of thing I encountered daily as an editor here. It seems that censorship is the core issue behind almost all of what afflicts the site yet when it is called out by a fellow contributor, it gets some phony """"we are all friends being neutral"""" rhetoric lobbed back and no progress is ever made. You say you are following the """"rules"""" even if you are, there are higher rules like """"truth"""" which should trump the petty stuff but that whole """"just following orders"""" excuse is so typically self defeating it embarrasses me to say I am human. 

At what point does a person ask the tougher question like """"what is the truth"""" and hold that question to a standard that trumps all other things? Example: That is why men get hanged when a Judge decides DNA evidence won't be used. No one is interested in truth, they would rather hang an innocent than seek or pursue the truth. Does it matter that the DNA evidence came in on a Thursday at 4pm after the evidence cut-off time for that judges jurisdiction or does it matter more that the evidence shows clear innocence? You would be the guy saying, """"3 revert rule"""" clearly states no evidence therefore all that follows is inadmissable. You are that guy who gasses Jews and says, the rules as you interpeted them suggested that was within the guidelines laid out by the almight founder of """"Wiki"""" and you are the guy strip searching 80 year old women on airlplanes in search of bombs because the """"rules"""" clearly state search everyone. NO COMMON SENSE is left in the entire world but we in the US are committed to our stupidity moreso than most.

What ever happened to good ole common sense. Go back and read through what was posted in the exchanges and try to fix the article. Offer something constructive to the world and stop haggling over the small stuff. You make no mention of the substance of the article just enlightening me about the rules. Thanks!

Can someone explain to me why the club's website (a biased source) should """"trump"""" all other sources? Soccer-holic has clearly explained the procedure for dealing with this.

"""==For Dr. Tim Vickers==

Undoubtedly Wikipedia is an important world resource on many topics. Certainly Wikipedia needs to maintain a high quality of references underpinning its articles. That is exactly why the references I have provided in the article must be accepted. They are based on considered conclusions from a wide range of quality sources. They are an accurate reflection of the work of Ed O'Loughlin made by people that know this area. There is no contrary evidence which any editor has brought to light. 
 

Therefore, blocking me (on trumped-up Wikipedia """"charges"""") does not bother me in the least. However, it is a sad reflection on your own processes. Why?

(1) Administrative editors specifically deleted my (concise) position statement in the RfC section and supplanted it with their own statement in an attempt to influence the RfC. These Administrators of Wikipedia were simultaneously advocating a particular viewpoint on O'Loughlin's work, and judging the validly of a contributing editor's references and attempting to silence him.

(2) The repeated deleting by Wikipedia editors of the words """"media monitoring groups"""" and substituting it with the words """"Jewish groups"""" (when they are by no means exclusively Jewish) will be of general wider interest, I think, and may have certain other implications.

(3) The comment by Manning that on advice he would overturn the blockade on me seems itself to have been overturned without explanation and an attempt was made to cover this up. With all the Wikipedia rules and procedures this arbitrary behaviour is rather unsatisfactory.

"After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

"Apologies 

Apologies. I wouldn't touch those pages on principle. I know a good editor, hotheaded, is on the block for the nth time. It is becoming a hobby in here. He seems the most watched man in the I/P area. Every misstep, slip of language, loss of patience, is summarily run into AN/I to make his indictment sheet belie the fact that many editors, on both sides, have found his work, on things like small towns, coordinates, etc., invaluable, and his assistence generous. He's careless on etiquette and form, and careful about useful edits on good pages. He hates bad work, and lets it run to his head. I put that note in quite aware he'll be booted up the arse once again, and dropped a note on his page to that effect. A pity. Had I the extreme interest in and knowledge of ther niceties of hauling anyone over the coals for policy infractions, I could spend most of my wiki time hauling people into these forums. Still, as Ashley knows, policy is policy, and trumps all. That's the nature of admin, and that's how wiki works.

With all due respect, the criticism section as it stands is a total mess. Setting aside the fact that it reads as if the year is 2001, an inordinate amount of text is devoted to a recitation of the Bovard article, which is A) a clear partisan attack piece (it begins with a snide and largely irrelevant attack on then-president Clinton's character), B) a shoddy piece of opinion journalism overwrought with loaded assumptions (witness the dismissive tone about """"politically correct noncompetitive recreation""""), and C) dated. Did nobody else notice this thing is almost a decade old? Yet it is being used as the backbone for the longest subsection on an organization that is evolving, growing, and changing to this very day. Bovard *does* bring facts to the table but as it stands now they are sitting in a void of time and space. His article does not make it clear how statistically representative the examples of """"corruption"""" were to Americorps as it functioned circa 1993-1999, let alone Americorps as it functions today.

I am not an expert by any means on Wikipedia's guidelines, I have never added or edited an article and it would not be appropriate for me to start here. But given this article's immediate onslaught of criticism, I would have expected an ongoing narrative about whether any stuck (especially with the imminent arrival of a conservative presidency) and how (and why) Americorps changed throughout the Bush years, leading into its present growth. Instead what we are left with is the cluttered product of a single user's anti-government tirade. I am not against noting that libertarians have a death wish for Americorps, but take, for instance, the section about Bovard's """"unofficial source,"""" who dismisses the reading program. From the beginning it was a rather questionable inclusion, but it is flatly contradicted by the study cited thereafter. Again, I'm no Wikipedia expert, but it seems to me an empirical measurement of reality should trump the anonymously-sourced attack from a pundit with a clear agenda. Why, then, is this whole exchange even necessary?

Equally embarrassing is the sentence about GED students, who now apparently need to be stigmatized for no reason. The short """"Articles suggest..."""" paragraph is only a little less disastrous; it presupposes that helping people get welfare is a bad thing, a judgment call which I think ought to be left to the reader. And even setting all that aside, why, from a journalistic point of view, does the above paragraph re-introduce the Bovard article? It disrupts the readability of this page, making it all the clearer that the criticism section comes from someone who is more concerned with piling one slanted attack after another than with writing an informative, cogent article. Narrative context is jettisoned in yet another paragraph (""""There have been a number of criticisms..."""") which goes on to raise vague, weaselly arguments sourced by an article that returns a 404. The user above me has a raised a critique that I think is also fair about the last paragraph's apparent opposition to the concept of self-esteem.

If I could make a suggestion (and given my lack of Wiki experience I freely welcome its rejection) this whole section, as well as the one above it, needs to be wiped clean. There is nothing wrong with noting that Americorps had some issues in the '90s, so long as this article leaves one able to discern that we are no longer living in the '90s. As it stands, the specific citations strike me as largely irrelevant cases of excess scrutinizing. The $20k+ cost to the taxpayer per volunteer is a valuable piece of information and should not be omitted from this article. It should also not be mentioned without reference to the benefits that Americorps volunteers provide. Contrary to the what the criticism section implies, it does not seem likely that tens of thousands of volunteers per year are being paid only to paint murals and put on puppet shows. If this means that Wiki editors have to conduct more contemporary research (the last 3-4 years seeming most appropriate) in order to determine just what services Americorps volunteers provide and who they affect, so be it. No doubt it would be even more difficult to assess how Americorps changes the lives and attitudes of its volunteers (and perhaps I am biased supposing from the onset that it creates more generous public services) but this, too, would be a benefit.

    In the Donald Trump article, the controversy is a SUBSECTION of another SUBSECTION """"Presidential Campaign 2016"""" of a SECTION heading""""Politics"""". This has been my point over and over again. Sigh. It's not a standalone section! Just because it has multiple sources does not mean it should be included as a standalone point! It should be a subsection of a section that says """"Political Views"""" or """"Socio-Political Commentary"""" for the article to be balanced.

 So, Jimbo's wrong and I'm wrong, but you're right ?    Not so sure about that.  either way, policy already forbids advertising.  So we already have a policy in place that says no to it, and policy trumps consensus. SO tell me again how you're right ?

"""

 Truthfulness, higher and lower are not well definable - they are simply relativistic and work at any point on the spectrum. For example you could say """"relative to humans, bovines are lower organisms,"""" but you could also say """"algae are lower organisms relative to mammals such as bovines and humans."""" You could use """"complex and simple"""" in the same way, but to me there appears to be some kind of teleological argument embedded in them. """"Higher and lower"""" are not too much different from """"complex and simple"""" in that they do not come from any """"theory"""" except to say that when a person looks at a chimp, they realize that the chimp is missing a few things that the human being has. That's just a fact, and remains such regardless of any well-crafted teleological counterarguments. ::::: Perhaps what you are really arguing is that """"higher and lower"""" are somewhat 
qualitative terms, and that science should not make qualitative distinctions, only quantitative ones. This is a valid argument, but only if science POV does not trump NPOV. We are all humans who read this encyclopedia, and humans do sometimes need qualitative distinctions in their language.- ( | t | e) """                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,0

Yet another triumph for the forces of darkness at Wikipedia. I also note again that the erroneous claims and deceit on the part of the editor making the complaint once more go completely unaddressed.

If any editors are interested in how there is a leftist bias prevailing within politics pages at WP, and how this is upheld by Admin when a challenge is made from an editor interested in correcting this, I invite them to look at what has been going on recently at the Roger Scruton page, which now will go on reading like an article that would be written by a left-wing tabloid and not an encyclopedia entry. The pattern, for those who are interested, is as follows:

 Leftist editor posts biased and inaccurate entries on WP politics page based on prejudice and ignorance, or in pursuit of an agenda to discredit a figure on the right of the political spectrum;
 Posts challenged by another editor;
 Leftist editor cannot cope with being challenged and having his ignorance/bias/agenda exposed;
 Leftist editor creates trumped-up (and in the latest example regarding the 3RR violation, in fact completely bogus) charges against the editor that has """"wronged"""" him and brings them to admin – a tactic that the """"wronged"""" editor knows will result in the """"blocking"""" (in effect censorship) of the editor who tried to address the leftist bias.

This is a process of censorship, and the procedure that is gone through at Admin nothing more than a show trial. It is rather ironic that I should see proof positive of this leftist bias at the Scruton page – Scruton has after all himself been vilified by the left throughout his career.

[ Herb Miller Orch ] 
né: John Herb Miller (he used the form: J. Herb Miller) 
b. 1915, d. 1987. Age: 72 (Stroke) 
Overview 
Herb Miller, Glenn Miller's younger brother, was born in North Platte, Nebraska, and, like Glenn, studied music in High School. Herb worked his way through college by playing the trumpet. He spent a short spell working in his brother's band, doubling as trumpeter and also as business manager. Herb then accepted an offer to play trumpet with Charlie Spivak. Herb did have a band of his own in the early 1940s. In 1943, he and his band appeared in a movie called """"Spotlight Scandals,"""" starring Harry Langdon (about a year before he died), and featuring singer Bonnie Baker. William Beaudine was the director. Late in the 1950s, Herb formed his band and toured the U.S. with appearances in hotels and ballrooms, including the Aragon Ballroom in Ocean Park, CA, the Jerry Jones Ballroom, and the Rendezvous Ballroom in Salt Lake City, UT. Yet, despite Herb's best efforts, the band only met with moderate success. The only album cut by the band, in America, was on Herb's own label, Millertone. While Herb's band never came even remotely close to the fame that his older brother Glenn achieved, it is still active and quite popular in England today (1999). After WWII, Herb settled in Pacific Grove, California, and made that his home base for about 25 years. 

Mr. John Lovejoy, a former student of Herb's and onetime member of his band, recalls: 
""""Herb didn't form his band while his brother was alive, and not until many years after his brother's death. He was so devastated by his brother's disappearance that he got out of the commercial music business and moved to Pacific Grove, where he got a job as an elementary and junior high school music teacher in the Pacific Grove Unified School District. 

""""I first met Herb when I was in fourth grade and became a beginning trumpet student of his. Herb's son, John, ( -John Arthur Miller, who today still leads the Herb Miller Orchestra in England), was my best friend in grammar school. Herb was a very talented music teacher, gruff but fair, and the kids all loved him. He also was the leader of the Monterey Civic Band, to which most of us Herb Miller Orchestra members belonged. (NB: Mr Lovejoy has advised that circa 2002, the orchestra was re-named the """"John Miller Orchestra"""".) 

""""Herb, for some reason, decided in the late 1950s to form his own band, and his own children were a part of it. John (known as 'Jackson') played bass and sang; Mary Luann, his eldest daughter, who went by 'Luann', also sang and played piano; Richard 'Richie' Miller, his younger son, played trumpet; and Janet, or 'Jannie,' his youngest child, sang. His wife, Ann, was band manager. Some of the rest of us were his former students who were still in high school or had recently graduated; other members were area teachers. One of his trumpet players, Tony Venza (whose playing sounded like Harry James), drove a moving van for a living. 

""""Initially, Herb was quite ambivalent about using his brother's fame to boost his own image. He actually used to claim that his band and Glenn's were not at all alike. But, in fact, they were almost identical. Herb looked and talked like Glenn ('And now, something a little old, new, borrowed and blue...'), although he was shorter in stature. He played Glenn's most famous songs, and his own arrangements sounded just like Glenn's. The only difference was that he used only two trombones instead of four, as Glenn did. 

""""The first record Herb made was called 'First Steps Of A New Miller' on the Millertone label. It was a failure, of course, since he paid for it out of his own pocket, and distribution was limited. And, of course, even in the 1950s-'60s, his music was dated. He thought it was because of rock and roll, which he fervently believed was a communist plot. He reasoned that the communists introduced rock and roll into American culture in order to put 'legitimate' musicians out of work and thereby ruin the American economy. 

""""Herb had a few other idiosyncrasies, too. For instance, when people found out he was Glenn's brother, they would inevitably mention Glenn's death. Herb would explode, 'Glenn's not dead! Don't ever say that again!' Later, a few years after he'd started his own band, he seemed to have accepted his brother's death. That's when he started drinking and when he started trading on his brother's name. 

""""After moving to England, he really went overboard on comparing himself to Glenn. He even had a poster made up with him posing exactly like the famous picture of Glenn, holding a trombone and looking over his shoulder. This was kind of strange because Herb's main instrument was the trumpet.

Well you're being dishonest in at least one point there, so I'm not sure what the purpose of this discussion is. At 1280x1024, for example, in fully updated FF, the edit links are indeed obscured. MOS is trumped by accessibility issues, period. Whitespace is purely cosmetic and therefore unimportant when it comes to ability of people to easily edit the page. Period. The gallery was merely an error; I had a long night at the restaurant and forgot to increase the size from the example template given. →  ₪ """                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,0
"HI new and a bit confused 

HI

My new wiki page that I submitted on Scott Tinkler (trumpet player) was deleted because it was copy pasted from somewhere else on the web - yes true  but I wrote that originally on the other site!

now it seems everything has been deleted - can I find it again as it was hours of fining all the relevant links and references.....

please help
this is so much harder and more esoteric than anything I have had to do online before

All arguments can be trumped by telling people to go away. The fact that having the last word is more important than the quality of all previous arguments doesn't make me inclined to use this website.209.89.84.174                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,0

Personally, I am shocked that this sort of statement would ever be appropriate for a Wikipedia article Talk page and if ever there was an appropriate moment for it to be statement would be for the private grievance process that any organization of value would recognize and have previously established if a need have developed. Anyone that would feel comfortable dealing in this particular way I would hope would realize their misjudgment. This type od action poisons minds and unsettles people that are in a setting that is of a making not of their own. Now as for what you said: """"I notice you're not interested in the substance here. Your personal attacks are out of order."""" Why on earth would anyone say such a conceited and probably self-serving statement especially when that seems to be in reply to someone cautioning you about what you say of others who replied to your reasoning of an issue and were not swayed. Not only that but that YOU felt compelled not to rest your argument for an issue on your own efforts but to bring in others to whom YOU showed their work and seemed more than happy to return an unfavorable review.

If I were charged with building support for an issue and wanted that effort thought on the reasons I presented then I certainly would not say that your work is no good because others have told me. What makes you think that what others not in the process of that deliberation trump the work of others? Was this brought on because someone was so forthcoming in an attempt to check your ulterior motives with the statement: """"Any nullification sourcing from you provides much more indication of what value it holds."""" Especially when that same person says, """"I am not here to actively make enemies and disrupt others. All I can say is that I reiterate my statement and that to yours, """"Take on a world with no problems, you take on problems and stand alone.""""

You are a trouble maker! And probably a sour sport. If any one is not interested in the efforts of Wikipedia is would appear just by your effort in this one section by itself. You can cry wolf only so many times before irritation precedes you. You just may have shown your true colors. Am I to encounter this type of motive in every article in Wikipedia or are your type in the single numbers and far and few between? Can anyone else speak to this. How should it be reported to the Amins at Wiki for at least review and potential resolution."""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,0

 Edit request on 3 August 2012 

98.150.203.19  
Hello there wiki, I have noticed some Bia's information on lion vs tiger, it seem's there is only pointing out the tiger's advantage's an giving false data upoun the lion, if you may, I have real documented data that exploit's what wiki is portraying in vast quanity's, which I would appreciate if you can atleast keep the information for educational purposes only an not levarge's on a Bia's purpose. 
-
Here is what I wish for you to edit... I know that tiger's have the title the world's biggest pure breed cat but they are only for maintaining heavy weight's more often, the lion still can reach any weight the tiger can, so in general what is being portrayed is false, you can put these weight's as they are scientifically factual...You can use just one if you may, but all show they are fact's...
{What ever weight’s the tiger has reach so can the lion}

"You know what else?  Because of the same type of bias that the guy is displaying, media reports are frequently biased.  It's like a bias echo chamber.  They write biased articles, then they come here and use Wikipedia to trumpet them. Clever, really, but unfair and untruthful."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,0

 http://twitter.com/#!/CungLe185/media/slideshow?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitpic.com%2F6fmuth Directly from his website. It would not make sense to represent the USA if he was not a citizen of the USA?

""""I talked to a coworker"""" is not a reliable source. I'm not sure how Twitter counts, but I'd assume that if he has his own personal Twitter account that counts as a primary source. Barring a reliable secondary source on what citizenship he has, primary sources trump """"I talked to a coworker"""", I believe. -  One ping only 
 He just tweeted this -http://scribe.twitter.com/#!/cungle185  @Luv4theGame I am a US citizen. Who cares what they say! They have nothing better to do with their time. Bushranger, I believe it is within my rights to use this information and finally close this issue because Cung Le has specifically stated that he is a U.S. citizen. I will now go and revert his pages, if you think I am violating Wikipedia rules. Please let me know, and I will stop. Again, I am trying to handle this as civil as possible. His twitter account is verified, and is listed on Facebook page, CungLe.com, and on the OFFICIAL UFC.com page.

"I have so little time to devote to this today. So far, I’ve spent my entire morning dealing with this editor. He just got through having it clearly demonstrated to him that it was at least 2:1 (probably 3:1) consensus against his wishes (he’s the only hold-out so far). Notwithstanding that, he restored all this deletions of entries that GFHandel and I have told him are inappropriate. Maybe you can try to straighten him out that such bold moves must first be discussed and a clear consensus for them agreed to before wholesale deletions of material can be made. The discussion is here at Talk:List_of_computer-aided_design_editors#Complaints_over_unfair_removal. Please check his recent edits. If he persists at what is increasingly looking like disruptive editing against consensus, this may have to go to ANI. He seems to be convinced that “his views of *the facts*” trumps “consensus”. I have to go for the moment; real life needs tending to. I’ll be back this evening. Thanks for your efforts so far on this, your above digging up of citations (that is really helpful) and whatever may happen with Duncan today. Hopefully too, GFHandel will weigh in today too. Perhaps you might want to wait until after he does so…"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,0
"""::I'm having a bit of trouble understanding what you are saying. You seem to be intent on invoking """"no consensus"""" (as in, """"me and my buddies will keep on revert warring on this to the end"""") as a way of disrupting this article - essentially a version of WP:IDON'TLIKEIT. As it happens, neither WP:IDON'TLIKEIT nor """"consensus"""" (the policy explicitly says that consensus cannot be held hostage) trumps WP:NPOV and WP:RS which are not just policies but also fundamental pillars.
I didn't say anything about Grifith nor Tibi for now, and I certainly did not say these guys were fringe (if that is the meaning of your last non-grammatical sentence).

The 'Abolish the GMC' Campaign is currently listed in the top 5 results of almost all of the relevant search terms relating to their noble cause. 'Abolish the GMC' even trumped WIKIPEDIA in almost all of them.

 """"Jesus and Messianic prophecy"""" 

Hey. I don't know if this is technically where I should be posting this; sorry if it's not.

1) Fine, if """"retort"""" isn't 100% appropriate then I'll use """"counter-argue""""- that is the meaning I was trying to get across.

But I think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with Wikipedia's guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general.

2) You said: """"Christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a time-line for the Messiah's actions, and the New Testament, especially the Book of Revelation, detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later. . This is a bit vague and raises some questions. Which Christians? Where did they say that? How did they detail it? Can you reference it from a notable/semi-notable scholar?""""

First, I can't point to a place in the Old Testament where the time-line DOESN'T exist, you know what I mean? There is no Jewish time-line so it cannot be referenced. But the New Testament does have a Christian time-line, as detailed in the Book of Revelation. Now, which Christians hold to this belief? Essentially all of them- all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the Bible, which is essentially all. Where did Christian authors detail this belief? In the Bible! How did they detail it? They wrote it in the Bible!!! That is why I made Bible references! Which scholar can I quote? How about John the Apostle, who wrote Revelation? Is one of the founders of Christianity an acceptable source on the subject?

I find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing, """"Christians believe Jesus came back from the dead, as detailed in various places, including the gospels,"""" and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting Bible passages and asking, """"which Christians believe that?"""". 

3) You said: This includes Jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse (Revelation 19-22). , although it does reference The Bible, if left alone, it sounds rather confusing. It also does not specifically reference a line from Revelation, nor does it reference which version of The Bible it quotes (King James, NIV, etc) which could mean a slight difference in the quote. 

If you want many specific Bible quotes then I'll put those in, and I'll list if its KJV or whatever. But I don't think that's required as my broad citation of Rev 19-22 does clearly explain exactly what I'm talking about, including a physical kingdom on earth, a messianic age of righteousness and so on. Just because I didn't dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesn't mean they aren't there- any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters.

If I had written, """"The story of Noah's Ark is in Genesis 6-9,"""" would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague? Just because I didn't give a synopsis with ten references doesn't mean it's unworthy; just look it up! 

4) What bothers me most is how this whole thing started when I tried to correct incorrect data on your site (the line that Christians don't believe in a physical resurrection). That line had NO references! So even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post, don't they? You can't delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all.

5) I'm sure you'll disagree with me on this one, but most of all, I think that my contribution didn't need to cite ANYTHING as it is such common knowledge that Christians believe in Judgment Day, an age of peace etc. I feel like I'm in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief. 

It's almost as bad as someone posting, """"Christians don't believe Jesus was tried, executed and came back to life,"""" then I post that they do, citing Luke 20-24, then you saying that it is too vague etc. It was pure courtesy to give the citation- it's such common knowledge that Christians believe these things!

But whatever- I'll repost with a several more-specific quotes. And BTW, you may think, """"Whoa, this guy care WAY too much about Wikipedia (and I'm a mod),"""" but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented. (And I hate inconsistency.)

"Apologies

I never got back to you properly about Wynton and Haydn and now I fear I never will: sorry. Briefly, I just felt that it was a bad example because (in my view) it both overestimated the impact of Wynton's recording, and underestimated how popular and well-known the concerto already was before Wynton was even heard of. It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due (I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player, but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him) and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one. It's not a situation like Gorecki 3 or the loathsome The Piano. It just, from where I am sitting, entirely lacks the feeling of a crossover. It's just one good recording, among many, of a very popular piece. LOTS of non-classical-specialists could whistle the 3rd movt tune while Wynton was still at school! ) I'm sorry to do this to you as you now won't have a chance to argue with me, but it's the best I can manage right now.

Try to keep up? Who are you to advise nonsense to me when there are clearly no mention of track sharing in any of UITP, USDT or APTA's references. Please read the references if you haven't done so. In fact, you have clearly not kept up with the sources that were posted a long time ago -  and  just to name a few. Again this is gong nowhere without a single source verifying anything here. Like you say, a source trumps everything so you better stop inventing nonsense claims like """"Seoul Subway Lines 1-9"""" that is non-existent in the very reference you quote.

""":: , I am not going to make this a personal dispute, or continue to argue.  If you feel Hanson's work is inappropriate, ask for a peer review.  This not the time or place to hold a dissertation or discussion on introduction into proper academic conduct.   I would advise you to read Norman J. Wilson's work, """"History in Crisis? Recent Directions in Historiography"""" and then we could discuss this.  If you feel that (cf. WP:RS#Beware_false_authority has been abused by the use of Hanson's work in this article, again, bring it to Kirill in the Military Group, or ask for a peer review.  I don't find bad scholarship amusing - what I find sadly amusing is that you persist in attacking me personally rather than simply proposing edits with more appropriate authors or more relevant historians if you feel such are needed.   I am trying my best to work on the article, and not indulge in personal disagreements or arguments over whether your degree trumps my degree.  I don't believe that bad scholarship has taken place here.  If you do, please bring it to Kirill - or more to the point, propose a rewrite with better sources!  While the rest of us are honestly trying to rewrite and improve, I don't see anything from you but personal attacks.  I won't go that route.  Again, please read J. Wilson's work, and we can talk somewhere else about trends in Historiography.  This space is for those who wish to work on this article.  If you feel you have better sources, my goodness, use them to simply write a suggested rewrite for the section of the article we are working on, post it here, and let everyone discuss it, as I did with my suggestions.
