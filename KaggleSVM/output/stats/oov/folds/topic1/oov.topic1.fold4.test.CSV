0,"I ask you, who is more reprehensible, a President who in the moment may not have found the right words of condolence (who hasn't been in that position) or the widow of the slain soldier who seemingly has gone out of her way  to politicize her husband's death, first by aligning herself with a known anti Trump zealot Congresswoman and then by ratcheting up the accusations each time a camera turns her way?

0,"There was no smear of Trump, it was his own words that the public heard.  He was speaking of his experience, he said so, that was not """"locker room talk"""".   It makes no sense for the GOP to support a Democrat candidate nor does it make sense that the Democrats would make up an allegation to get Republicans to vote for a Democrat.  The only person that should resign is the person that was twice removed from his office for unethical & illegal actions.

Aide: """"Mr. President, our review of last year's Air Force bombing in Syria, has shown we have killed over one hundred ISIS rebels! Unfortunately, over 400 innocent children and civilians were blown to bits.""""  Trump: """"Great news! What's that about the collateral damage again?""""  And there you have it - ALL killing in """"war"""" is inhuman and barbaric. Having your children killed by chemicals, is little different than being blown to bits over dinner by other chemicals. Both are equally evil. The US still manufactures & uses cluster bombs - banned by all remotely civilized nations. They still have over 3000 tons of banned chemical weapons - more than three times Syria's!  The US has used chemical weapons many times (Korea, Indochina, the ME). Why are THEY exempt from demands to destroy these weapons?  Hypocrisy... thy name is Trump.

0,"Productive Americans don't seem divided over whether American sovereignty or America's way of life should be given up to some sort of Planetary Police in the name of """"climate change"""".  One wonders whether it's called the Paris Accord, not a treaty, just to bypass America's Constitutional requirement for a treaty to be ratified.  The trick is this:  Under Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties (Vienna, 23 May 1969), America's Constitution does not matter, once our country's representative signs --or in some way agrees-- to an international agreement, the United States must consider itself bound by that agreement. If our representative signs something which is not a treaty or agrees to it through diplomatic channels, that's the equivalent of a signed treaty. Senate ratification is not needed or required.  Thank you, President Trump, for saving us from a really bad deal.
"
0,"All those who are so loudly applauding Trump's ban should look at the details. He didn't ban anyone from the countries like Saudi Arabia, where he has hotels and golf courses.  Saudi Arabia has been shown to be home to some of the worst terrorist groups, a hotbed of IS.  Probably his immigration ban is one more publicity stunt, a way to increase profits and get free advertising, except that real people are being hurt.  A lot the Trump gang cares about that.

1,"Per usual, there's all kinds of leaks about a White House """"shakeup,"""" with some aides now saying a big house cleaning wouldn't look so good following the recent turmoil and Trump's big overseas trip.  But one person who does look uniquely vulnerable is the jittery guy who kicked off his press briefing career on Jan. 23 with a diatribe directed at the very people charged with relentlessly covering one of the most scandal-ridden White Houses in modern politics. One way or the other, Sean Spicer’s role will almost certainly be scaled back. - Because Trump's achievements have been “tremendous” and his Twitter messaging has been pitch perfect. If only the comms folks weren't constantly fumbling all the “winning.”  To be sure, Spicey's no crackerjack at the podium, but Trump’s messaging problem emanates from the raging dumpster fire that is Donald Trump.  There's just no putting lipstick on that pig, Spicey or not. But perhaps the dumpster fire himself can take a whack at it.

Political correctness is a thing, but that doesn't mean that everyone who disagrees with you is PC.  You might be right about Trump. He's a loose cannon and he doesn't owe the Republicans anything. He's not invested in just being anti-liberal. For all we know, he might decide that clean energy and energy independence are a patriotic thing. He might decide that the only workable health care system would be single-payer. I think he actually has said that our infrastructure should be maintained. I don't care who does a good thing. If the Republicans need to be the ones to get credit, and Trump can get it done, that's fine with me.  I think he's only interested in Trump, but his ego might make him want to do a good job.
"
1,"Oh please do, then we overwhelm you with idiotic Trump gaffes. There are multiples, daily.  but please try to stick to those made when he was president what Obama said in grade school is hardly relevant.

Update: Never mind, I found your """"source,"""" which predictably didn't provide any way to check their alleged """"quotes.  But let's assume aruendo, that Obama said everything they said he did.

It is not likely that any judge wants to be seen as """"activist,"""" but on the other hand they are ethically and morally obliged to defend the laws and freedoms of the United States, and of their home states in particular.  It is shocking that it has come to this. Congress and the Senate are clearly too frightened of Trump to appear """"politically correct.""""  Imagine the implications of that! Being politically correct means that you are correct. Being politically incorrect means that you are incorrect. Putting the word """"politically"""" in front of incorrect does not change it. And yet we have lawmakers who are afraid of being correct, or are disdainful of those who are.  Trump's foolish pronouncements should properly be challenged by elected officials, and it shouldn't be left to judges to put themselves on the line and in the hot seat to fix Trump's bad ideas.
"
0,"The most important piece of information I saw come out of the hearing was when Comey was asked about the legality of leaks. He indicated that while a leak of TRUE information from a secret briefing would be illegal, leaking a LIE about information from a secret briefing would not be illegal. Accordingly, we can conclude that fugitive leakers such as Assange and Snowden did in fact release real secrets.  Conversely, we can think it likely that most of the anonymous leaks about Trump et al have been false. I await the pro forma insults from the usual gang.

Trudeau's bromance with Obama has surely closed doors including the Whitehouse Oval office for the next 4 years. Pretty sure Trudeau has no plan to help employment in any part of the country, to help py for his deficit borrowing.

And talk about authoritarian. Who do the neoliberals pick for their leaders? Trudeau who's father just happened to be Prime Minister, and Clinton who's husband just happened to be President.

By the way, I am not saying the Dems have not used the same sort of fear mongering in the past - I grew up in the Democrat controlled /segregated South.  But something changed the Dems.  Unfortunately, it didn't change the South and now the Pubs are doing the same kind of fear mongering and, from a Southerners perspective, spread it around to other places (just look at new voter id laws in Pub controlled states.)  Could we reach a point where both parties learn and we can move past this?

"
1,"Unfortunately for Mr tRump, his politicization of everything has taken what may have been an unfortunate choice of words and turned it into -surprise! A race issue. I can forgive Mr tRump for his poor choice of words- how can you possibly console someone at a time like this- especially if you’re a stranger. And Mr tRump is a verbose imbecile whose rhetoric is normally confined to monosyllabic repetition. So yeah, it’s a given he’s going to say something stupid- it’s inevitable. The only wildcard is the degree of stupidity or inappropriateness. But when you have an unapologetic(?!) white supremacist in the White House, trying to console a non-white person about their non-white loved one, any misstep is going to be seen as racially motivated. Notice how tRump immediately compared his actions to those to the last REAL President as proof. Why did he not compare himself to Dubya?

"
1,"You're right. The irony is that far from being socialized medicine, the Affordable Care Act (with its roots in proposals first offered by conservatives in the Nixon years and adopted by Mitt Romney in Massachusetts), is a conservative approach to trying to achieve something that at least aims for universal coverage. No one ever suggested that the ACA is perfect. Over the years since it was adopted, experience exposed its strengths and weaknesses. President Obama and the Democrats in Congress pursued various ways to improve/strengthen the ACA. It was always the policy of the Republicans to obstruct and undermine the ACA. Now that they occupy the White House and have majorities in both Houses of Congress , their dishonesty is on full display. Obviously Trump lied every time he opened his mouth about health care. Nobody believes Trump about anything. However, Paul Ryan is no better. """"Repeal and Replace"""" was and is, always and everywhere, a filthy, cynical 'bait and switch.' Deplorable.

0,"any market changes in the first two years of any presidency .. has nothing to do with that presidency.  In a democracy like the US, it takes many years for changes to work their way through the legislative system, and sometimes years after that for it to manifest in real economic shifts.  So, there might be ostenibly a 'trump bump' based on emotions, but the market emotions are as fleeting and significant as the moods of a newborn child.   However the real persistence of a soaring US economy the last few years is definitely attributable to an Obama presidency which did not meddle in the economy much, let it ride on the merits of free capitalism.  And on that note, Trump's main economic platform is .. to stifle free capitalism by stifling free trade.

In case you haven't noticed, he's got the corner on administering the Trump rubber hose treatment, mainly because he was here first.  Plus his column comes out two days before your column so by the time we see yours, our eyes glaze over and our collective tummys hurt at the continuation of the Trump beating, especially since you're not saying anything new and fresh.  Virtue signaling to show you're a good liberal who's upset with Trump has gotten old and stale.  Sir, I hereby challenge you, not to a duel at noon in the middle of a dusty street, but, instead, to find other topics upon which to pontificate.

Congress is not taking care of the people's business, which is their only reason to all be in Washington at the same time. They were not elected to be insurgents and shut down the government for partisan political reasons, or to advocate for their best donors, or damage confidence in the government itself by insuring that it does not work as well as it could. (The Zika virus legislation that died through automatic GOP manipulation of the bill is a good example of how legislators failed to protect the people when they had a chance, proving that government is no help, even in the face of a public health emergency. Republicans make sure the people's government doesn't work and then use that as a reason to do it more damage.)

Many presidents and other world leaders have enjoyed the campaigning theatrics, spotlight and instant feedback more than the tough, tedious, solitary process of actually governing.  Reagan and Bill Clinton come to mind as kindred souls with The Come Over King in this regard.  And we have arguably the most campaign-driven leader in the world today, someone who may not be experienced at the tedious tasks of actually governing but who campaigns 24/7 in Justin Trudeau.

A common chant at political protests in Quebec for decades has been """"X, au poteau!"""", meaning literally """"X, to the post"""", i.e. the execution post. Did anyone actually mean """"kill X""""? In the heat of the moment, some maybe, but was it ever taken literally? I doubt it.  It is also bizarre considering that there is a long tradition of burning politicians, etc. in effigy at political protests, union protests, etc. How is this any different, particularly since """"locking someone up"""" is lot less extreme than burning them or calling for their execution.  More concerning is people *actually getting fired* for having the wrong opinion. That is something happening for real.

Great that you were lucky enough to have a nice secure Air Force job for 26 years.  Trump took five deferrals to avoid being drafted and then, when he couldn't use that scam anymore, suddenly developed horrendous """"bone spurs"""" on his foot, at least according to the letter from his family's doctor, that kept him out of the draft.  Didn't keep him from golfing or playing other sports at the time, though.  And then, when the draft was ended, the """"bone spurs"""" quickly cleared up.

The US is under no obligation to prove anything to anyone before acting in their own defense.  They will act, and it will be punishing for Russia and Mr. Putin.

Scalia was one and so apparently is Clarence Thomas, Roberts is in the orbit and so is Gingrich. (As far as I know, Rudy Giuliani does not pretend to be religious anymore than Trump himself.)  Disliking Jews does not make someone a Nazi. Thinking violence against Jews should be legal or that Jews should lose their civil rights makes someone a Nazi. It's a vitally important distinction.

Incidentally, the US government is under no obligation to share proof, or anything else, with you.

And why do you keep mentioning Donald Trump...what in the world does Trump have to do with the views or actions or statements of either Fillon or La Pen?  Again, you had to use the term """"racism.""""   And now, """"hate.""""  To shout""""racism"""" and """"hate"""" isn't citing evidence of racism or hate.   It's just playing word games.  This is your 3rd post on this topic, and you still can't simply cite anything that La Pen has said or done that makes her markedly different from Fillon.  Why do you think that is?

1,"Trump said on the campaign back in December 2015: “It was reported today [Obama] played 250 rounds of golf and he’s going to be in Hawaii, I think did they say for three weeks?” Trump said at a Monday night campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich. (via Golf.com). “Two hundred and fifty rounds, that’s more than a guy who plays in the PGA Tour plays. He played more golf last year than Tiger Woods. We don’t have time for this. We have to work.” Obama golfed 333 times as president, according to Mark Knoller of CBS News, a noted scrutinizer of presidential schedules. Obama golfed at a rate of once for every 8.8 days he was in office. April 1st was the 72nd day of Trump’s presidency. The Palm Beach Post’s best estimate is that Trump has played golf 12 times through Saturday. Including his round with Rand Paul, that’s a rate of once every 5.9 days.  Golfer in Chief  hard at work.  Hypocrite!!!  But what else do you expect from such a liar. """"We have work to do.""""

0,"Canada's $20 billion deficit (2016) is approx 1% GDP. That's PEANUTS.  Compare Canada and USA. Trump has inherited from Obama a $600 billion (3% GDP) deficit.  Q: Any idea how much deficit and debt Trump is going to create with his tax cuts, increased military spending and a $1 trillion infrastructure program over 10 years? A: It's YUGE!  Anyway, Trump seems to know what he's doing. According to Trump: “I’m the king of debt; I understand debt probably better than anybody. I know how to deal with debt very well. I love debt.”

0,"What matters, surely, is per capita GNP growth, not simply GNP growth? However,  McKenna doesn't specifically address per capita GNP growth.  India and China have much larger GNPs than Canada, but much lower per capita GNP. Lots of  people most of whom are poor tend to produce that mathematical result. Trump's proposal, as I understand it, wasn't to reduce the number of skilled immigrants to the US but to reduce the number of family category immigrants (as opposed to just spouses and underage children). One might plausibly argue that increasing the number of skilled immigrants even more would increase US per capita GNP and would be the rational thing to do   However, it is less clear how admitting fewer aged relatives would decrease per capita GNP,  even in a country that, unlike Canada, lacks universal health care, or, for that matter, how admitting fewer aged relatives would decrease the number of candidates for low paying unpleasant jobs.

0,"October 10 is the anniversary of the NK communist party. Missile movements have been spotted, NK usually celebrates such holidays with some military demonstration, and NK has threatened an H-bomb test in the Pacific --- which would mean not just lobbing missiles over Japan again and making people run for cover again, but lobbing an H-bomb over Japan. I think that's probably what Trump was talking about --- perhaps taking proactive measures against an expected upcoming missile launch/H-bomb test in the Pacific --- which NK will probably construe as an act of war.

Populists are for the people but only the right kind of people. For Bryan it was rural, teetotaling, protestants. For both Sanders and Trump it was middle-aged, unemployed, blue collar whites. You seem to be of the mind that anyone with a decent job, who sees that today's issues are extremely complicated with no easy solutions, is part of the 1% or Them, even if their income is light-years away from the stratosphere of the 1%.

Several people, including Republicans, and many of our top Generals, and constitutional lawyers have told Trump that (1) he is taking an approach that creates constitutional issues by among other things discriminating by religion., and (2) he should follow Obama's previous orders based on persons who might be terrorists and not countries--believe it or not, there are more than six countries from which terrorists can come. Obama looked at where people went (like did they visit regions of Iraq which are the site of terrorist training centers) regardless of whether they were citizens of Syria or Egypt or Canada). Trump can tighten up the language or he can lower Obama's limits on numbers of immigrants, but keep the form of the order.

I have heard the death of the GOP pronounced for 16 years, and I'm not convinced. That said, I think the GOP is facing a decisive split that will determine the Republican Party's future.

I sometimes wonder about how easy it what it was for politicians 150 years ago, when the """"masses"""" would seldom ever hear and see details of a leader's shortcomings and behaviour. Nowadays, due to the Internet, even many of the poorest people in the world know instantly and exactly what the controversial President is saying (and what their own leaders are saying too). They can even watch things live. That's what makes Trump's countless """"loud and dumb"""" remarks so much a part of today's world. The world is laughing at the U.S.A.. Russians especially.

Our manufacturing industries have lost diversification and competitiveness, with virtually no value -added industries being developed and growing to our resource industries.

0,"There a a few things Trump can learn from Native America. One, how to run successful casinos. None of the Indian casinos have declared bankruptcy that I can recall. His has. And probably all of gaming interests are money losers. Two, how to run successful businesses. When the Land Claims of act of 1971 was passed most non-Native people in Alaska were against it, including the Alaska State Chamber of Commerce. Now, we’re in the Top 10 if not Top 5 of Alaska businesses.  For the unschooled and the unlearned, our so-called entitlements are payments and support for all the land stolen and confiscated without due process and without payment for what we owned prior to contact. Lower 48 Indians lost 99-percent of their lands and resources over time. Alaska Natives lost 320 million acres to state, federal and private interests. Our entitlements aren’t free.  Lastly, as I always say: Indian country now, Indian country tomorrow, Indian country forever.

0,"IRT kuroiwaj, with respect to accountants, tax advisors, attorneys, IRS, and other professional that have worked on Trump's tax returns I will expect absolute confidentiality.  All these professionals are bound by a code of ethics.  A breach of that code means disbarment and a loss of their professional license to practice.  I have yet to meet a professional that would willing violate the code of ethics.  More importantly Trump has repeatedly avoided the release of his tax returns, even though he has promised to do so after his election.  So instead of releasing his returns he has his attorneys release a letter essentially saying """"don't worry we looked at it and nothing's wrong"""".  I am assuming that you voted for Trump given your posted support for him.  But doesn't his refusal to release his returns seem odd to you?  If there is nothing wrong, as his attorneys represent, then what is Trump worried about?

I also find it to be detrimental to human interactions.  And yes, love is often associated with weakness and idealism, but I see it as strong and practical. I disagree with much of what Trump has to say and also those who agree with him when he espouses hate. I do not hate him or his followers. We live in a semblance of a democracy and should do our best to listen to other points of view. Tolerance does not mean accepting hate.

0,"OMG. Some of these comments are based on thin air. Fact. When Obama signed the DACA Program as an Executive Order, it was because the stupid Republican lead congress CHOSE not to act upon it, stating that only the congress could enact such a program. They argued about the merits all the while knowing they wanted no action in order to see Obama fail. So Obama decided to use a squeeze through measure that would allow for a Presidential Executive order to enact this program. The response would be that the congress would have to sue the White House for a decision. The few Republican holdouts came from red states that did not care about these children. However, the Republican leaders choose not to sue and instead let the program remain. Trump has been threatened by the same Republican holdouts that they will sue if he doesn't rescind the order, which he has the right to do. Instead of standing up to these bullies, he caved. Leaving it up to congress. Nothing will get done.

The optics are horrible and inexcusable. Rationalizing that this is not technically wrong does not justify the problem. Trudeau, while promising change, has not delivered in this key area.

0,"Trump is a reckless, dangerous, unstable man.  The damage he's doing is not so muh to President Obama, but to the country.  I hope (and believe) that President Obama is measuring his response not so much in terms of what is good for him and his family, but what is goo for the country. It is important to demonstrate to the world that our constitutional system of government works; that the president is not above the law; that we have the means, the will and the courage to remove him from office through a constitutional process.

0,"Without commenting on the Trump approach to illegal immigration, here are some facts:  There are about 11 million illegal immigrants in the USA today. Of those, about 5.5 million are illegal Mexican immigrants, and millions more are from Central America by way of Mexico. About 8 million of those illegal immigrants are employed in the US workforce. (Pew Research)  There isn't a country in the world that wouldn't perceive that level of illegal immigration as a problem. Were we to scale America's number to Canada's population, it would amount to 1 million illegal immigrants. At present, we have about 75,000. So America's issue is real, and many people are concerned about it.  If you were president, if not a wall, what steps would you take?

That peak was the highest employment since 1987 (260K jobs). https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet (Series Id: CES1021100001)  Trickle down economics perhaps?  Even if you believe trickle down economics helps the working classes, the O&G industry revenues (although still insanely large) went down after the 2010's oil market glut.  Adding more production will not help.  Gas Prices?  The O&G industry is working to drive prices up, not down.  We have too much oil production, not too little.

He could publicly offer to hand over every bit of information that any investigator could want.  Make the offer loud and in public, let the Special Counsel and the House and Senate have everything they could want, and leave it at that.  Instead, he keeps acting like someone who is trying to hide a bad act.  The longer he hangs on and acts guilty, the more likely they are to keep digging and find something, even something unrelated.

All of the many Russia/Trump investigations are ongoing. We are not so easily distracted that we can't be appalled at his latest irrational cruelty.

0,"A newly-elected President says a lot with the choice of the first country that he visits. Trump danced the Sharia Shuffle with his Saudi hosts, and we should remember, as Fareed Zakaria writes, “that for five decades, Saudi Arabia has spread its narrow, puritanical and intolerant version of Islam — originally practiced almost nowhere else — across the Muslim world. Osama bin Laden was Saudi, as were 15 of the 19 9/11 terrorists. And we know, via a leaked email from former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, in recent years the Saudi government, along with Qatar, has been “providing clandestine financial and logistic support to [the Islamic State] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.” Saudi nationals make up the second-largest group of foreign fighters in the Islamic State and, by some accounts, the largest in the terrorist group’s Iraqi operations. The kingdom is in a tacit alliance with al-Qaeda in Yemen.”
"
0,"This has the potential to get so much worse. Even if you disregard that the US has 11 million undocumented immigrants and every 1% that flee to Canada is 110,000 people and the fact that Trump is systematically going after them, there is also the lure that free money, housing and healthcare represent to the rest of the world. All they need to do is get here. Even an American single mother living in Chicago where 4000 people were shot last year could have a claim.  Every Government service could soon be overwhelmed. I'm sure the teachers' unions wont mind a higher student teacher ratio and parents wont mind the quality of their children's education decreasing and Canadians will surely understand increased waits for healthcare after paying severe taxes their entire lives. If we're redeploying our border patrols are we leaving other parts undefended or is the plan to make the payment at the border so sweet that only the migrants with criminal records would try to sneak in elsewhere?

"
0,".  A good time for Trudeau to be meeting with the unstable POTUS.  The Gong Show that has constituted  Trump's international meetings to date has held up his incompetence in this area to great ridicule.  Trump badly needs to be seen having a productive and adult relationship with another national leader.  His relationship with the President of Mexico is toxic.  After much bluster about putting China in line, he was slapped down in one phone call with President Xi.  His petulant phone call with the Australian PM ended when Trump hung up on him.  During his phone call with Putin, he had to Putin on hold while he asked his aides what the nuclear START Treaty is.  The friendly confines of a meeting with the affable Leader of the US's biggest trade partner, closest ally and immediate neighbour may allow the President to be seen as actually able to  converse with foreign leaders in something approaching a sophistication worthy of his office.  I expect that the meeting will go well.  .

Trump doesn't want to pay for it, this why he withdraws from TPP, in which Vietnam is posed to gain 20% in their GDP but US almost nil. It is turning into something not that American like it or not, but can afford it or not.

0,"Trumpster aside, the US voter registration system is susceptible to abuse by non- citizens,  Currently, we do not issue any general-use document intended to confirm both identity and citizenship. While a U.S. passport may be used for both these purposes, it is a travel document. Most people seek a passport when planning a trip and only a relatively small proportion of the population holds a passport at any given time. 9  As a result, the preferred form of documentary identification in the United States is the drivers’ license. Drivers’ licenses are issued by the states, pursuant to a widely varying body of state-specific laws and regulations. Currently, twelve states and the District of Columbia allow illegal aliens to obtain a drivers’ license.  So, tell me why tightening down voter fraud when it may have handed our current Commander-in Chief his presidency?  Frankly, if he had anything at all to hide, he certainly would NOT be pursing this.

As wired as the US is, a well coordinated cyber attack could be as effective as an all-out military assault.  So do we take our cyber weapons away from the government while other countries develop theirs?  Trump wants to spend an additional trillion dollars on our enormously bloated military budget.  But the next major war is far more likely to be fought with bits and bytes, not with firepower.  Military drones and mortars can be used against American citizens just as easily as against enemies.  The reason they aren't is that we have strong civilian control over the military (at least for now).  Eliminating our cyber defensive capabilities is idiotic.  What we need to figure out is how to prevent them from being used against Americans.

It showed clips of interviews with various Swedish people talking about some of the problems.  The other news reports date back to 2013. I applaud Sweden's willingness to open up the country to refugees but it seems that there is some denial that there is a problem. Can't solve a problem if you are in denial. Many of the European countries taking in refugees do not have the best track record on assimilation.  Sweden along with other countries can take a look at countries where assimilation has been successful. It is unfortunate that there are not safe alternatives for the refugees who do NOT want to assimilate. If such safe places could be available to them until they can return to their own country, it would be a better solution. Very few of the refugees wanted to be refugees anymore then us.

Now the products are manufactured in the US which invariably raises the costs of products resulting in reduced  sales leading to reduced production leading to loss of profits,  reduced dividends to shareholders. not to even consider  loss of exports and countervailing import taxes abroad. It appears to me that the President elect is about to shoot the collective American foot.  Of course I could be wrong and not include such incentives as corporate tax reductions that will have to be met  by increases in the national debt or in personal income taxes.  Even if the US Government reduces expenditures, I wonder what remains to be cut? Weaponry is not on the list but social policies obviously are and cutting those too far can also have unforeseen and unwelcome consequences.

So when the difficulties come, they will bend to Trump's strange will and not do what America needs, to be an independent voice for the American people. Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon

0,"I'm more than a bit shocked with any assessment that thinks progressives should miss Steve Bannon.  His global strategy was hardly global and didn't care about peace for the world.  His crusader mentality was not what I hope God has in mind for the Middle East.  His trade policies might have gone parallel with Bernie, but not all of us progressives thought Bernie had the economic answers for global solutions.  And there is the white male supremacy of Breitbart fueled by Bannon and now embodied in Trump.  There is no rational or moral justification for any of that.  Fr Reese might just as well be asking progressive Catholics to swallow the 'one note' line of conservative voters by substituting trade policy for abortion and just holding our noses while we voter for utter immoral chaos.

0,"I don't know why people should be surprised at the Trump regime's contempt for the rule of law. Much as Trump's insurgent campaign was judged to be based on saying out loud what the Republican establishment and its plutocratic patrons had for years been merely dog whistling, Trump's assault on the rule of law merely brings out of the shadows capitalism's relentless assault on democracy and champions rampant markets as the ultimate arbiters of all social value. The postwar experiment that attempted to blend democracy and capitalism is definitively over: You can have one or the other and it's pretty clear which side Trump is on. People of good conscience everywhere need to stand up and call the enemy by its name and get busy rebuilding democratic institutions that are capable of beating back predatory market capitalism.

Whether it manifested in an angry populace warming up to Kenney or not - there is no doubt that on one side, BC is doing all it can to block oil from getting to market. Looking East, Quebec is doing the same - with Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre declaring Victory!! when the Energy East pipeline was withdrawn. And of course, we have the Trudeau Liberals saying one thing and doing another. So here we have Alberta - and by extension Canada - foregoing tens of billions of dollars in revenues and Canadian jobs - for what? So Obama can claim that """"he's built enough pipelines to encircle the globe - and then some""""? So China and India can continue to build coal-fired generator plants well into the future? So Donald Trump can unshackle the EPA regulations? Yessirree - we're setting an example for the world - on how to be suckers!

Comey, had relieved “great pressure” on him, according to a document summarizing the meeting.  “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,” Mr. Trump said, according to the document, which was read to The New York Times by an American official. “I faced great pressure because of Russia.

Trump then simply a business man and TV personality but now the President of the United States of America and no longer involved in the business having turned over all the day to day stuff, trusting in the blind Donald Jr. and the other son, then it seems reasonable to me that the Supreme Court of Canada would accept the Ontario Court ruling final.

0,"While I honestly think that something went on, I tend to believe that Trump knew little if anything of it.  My bet is that his people did collude with the Russians, but that they kept him in the dark.  That would explain his behavior to this point.  He is lashing out, because he feels he has been falsely accused.  Unfortunately, it is probably the most likely scenario.  If for no other reason, I just don't think Trump is smart enough to pull off that type of collusion, and he to date has shown that he has so little impulse control, that he would have let something slip by now.  All that being said, some of what he has done in reaction to this could be seen as obstruction of justice and I could see him still being impeached, not for collusion, but for trying to sway the investigation.  And in the end, wouldn't that be the kicker, he did nothing wrong to begin with, but his reactions to an investigation created an impeachable offense.

Sean Spicer says Trump feels great about visiting Mar-a-Lago and spending millions of dollars of taxpayer money.  I predict Trump will resign in a few months. It's obvious he hates being President and is totally out of his depth. He will announce his resignation and then depart for New York. He will then tweet what a great job he has done and finished all that he wanted to do.

Then she will decide what to do with it. It could be evidence of a crime, in which case she will turn it over to the police. It could be evidence of a national security concern, in which case she will turn it over to the government. Or it could be nothing at all, in which case she ignores it. In this instance, the record shows that DT Jr. obtained no information worth using as political ammunition or worth passing on to the authorities.  Sorry Trump-haters, better luck next time.

It helps to be cognizant of what drives Trump: his contempt for Obama. The ONLY thing he cares about is undoing Obama's legacy, his signature achievement.

What the people who are trying to destroy records of all the “bad people” in American history are doing reminds me of what the Chinese Red Guards did when they destroyed countless irreplaceable records of China’s 5000 history. <p>  Destroying American history (e.g. statues of Confederates, etc) is exactly the reason why some of the marchers in the Charlottesvill march were protesting; they were not Neo-Nazis or White Supremist or sympathetic to their causes. And neither was President Trump for those Neo-Nazis or White Supremists as Mr. De Busca implies. </p>.  <p>In fact the “very fine people” President Trump was referring to were people like the teacher and her husband who were interviewed on TV. They said they were there to oppose the destruction of the statues, which are integral parts of American history. These were the “very fine people” President Trump referred to; not the Neo-Natzis or White Supremists who he has disavowed many times. </p>

0,"Do you know someone suffering from Trummpy Unacceptance & Resistance Disorder Syndrome (TURDS)? TURDS is a pattern of pathological dissociative and psychotic behavior, first observed in the late hours of Nov 8th 2016, and increasing in severity with the passing of time. Sufferers of TURDS are identified by a persistent cognitive dissonance, sudden bouts of rage, rioting, and uncontrollable crying. TURDS is caused by the election of Trummpy. People with TURDS are characterized by a persistent unwillingness to accept that Donald Trump is president. Research is ongoing, but TURDS appears to correlate closely with some of the following environmental and behavior factors: membership in the Democratic Party, currently enrolled in a college and/or possession of a Liberal Arts Degree, and living in densely populated metropolitan areas. TURDS is known to rapidly reproduce in college safe zones exponentially.

What’s more, undocumented immigrants also contributed $35.1 billion to the Medicare Trust Fund between 2000 and 2011, according to a 2015 Journal of General Internal Medicine study.

President Trump has no bearings on researched facts or any positive outcomes relating to a country such as Iran as we all have seen his characteristic speeches on his foreign policies as well as national statements regarding US security. Thus, it is imperative to understand why Trump makes certain decisions based on his inadequate knowledge and bias opinions as these may have negative implications for a country that really wants to succeed on a global level.

Another criticism that Rampell makes is that Trump promised not to cut legal immigration, yet now he is set to do that if this Senate bill becomes law. We would see whether the slashing of numbers would give us more, or less, of the """"talented, rich, young productive individuals"""" you foresee.  We also need """"impoverished immigrants"""" willing to do the hard work in agriculture and construction that our own citizens often don't have the skill or the will to do.

No unicorns this week but two months back a mountain goat wandered down. Had two visit from Bears. The seals were in at high tide playing under the Herring Cove bridge but no unicorns  although the Trumpeter Swans stopped for a few days on their annual trip North. Did drive past the local cannabis emporium and saw skiffs tied up at the dock waiting for the crews to make their purchases. If you equate unicorns with rainbows then we have several a day!

0,"Hawaii is not as unique as you think. Clinton's and Trump's shares of eligible voters were both only in the high 20% range:  44% of US eligible voters, ... didn't.  Multiple reasons not to vote have nothing to do with mail in convenience. 1) Electoral college means HI vote matters little; 2) many think not registering keeps you off jury duty rolls; 3) common sense is that your one vote won't make much difference; 4) poor candidate info means people avoid the folly of a vote for an unknown; 5) DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOMINANCE means most feel it doesn't matter, and minority party opponents of quality are discouraged from running.  Don't forget, mail-in voting allows many private opportunities for group and individual peer pressure. Quasi-coercive group voting is already a staple of union tactics.  Other one-on-one pressure tactics are even harder to police. No 'poll watcher' can see what's going on. That's why existing vote-influencer groups actually like all-mail balloting. Careful!

You cannot have unity with those who follow the works of Satan. The hollywood elites who follow the teachings of the devil were in full display yesterday. The baby killers were out in force and of course the National Catholic  Reporter is true to form in its subversive message by criticising a pro life President.

The FBI memo was endorsed by the AG and Deputy AG of the US and the President of the US-- so Hillary is effectively vindicated. Trump did this to get Democrats to approve the firing of Comey (but failed).

BC is staggering around in the """"ENTOURAGE """" reality tv mode that all is well with runaway house prices.

Alberta looks to do well, as Trump sees the oil sands as the strategic supply to tell OPEC to take a hike. As for the rest of Canada not so much. Ontario, Quebec, British Columbi have no real independent product to offer USA. And it will come out in the coming months just how harmed Trudeau has had on the Canadian / USA relationship.

He discovered that, while banning individuals for legal reasons is appropriate for all countries, blanket banning of all nationals from entire countries is illegal under international laws which are enshrined in treaties the U.S. Congress signed. But countries who did same in response to such an illegal ban is in fact legal.  He will discover that imposing 20% blanket tariff is illegal under both WTO and NAFTA and will be struck down by the court. But the exact retaliation is legal.  And now I come to the real reason why Trump is in such a hurry to ban from the 7 countries. The Obama administration have bombed the 7 countries resulting in 25,000 deaths according to independent observers. The CIA estimated that there are now enough anger for them to stage another 9/11 and have detected signs. It urge Trump to blanket ban travels to check any such plans.

Both the conservatives and the liberals have been getting played by their elected officials for the last 80 years in this country. Conservatives, typically mistrustful of government, saw it first in 2008 and in most years since, when the election was pretty much handed over to a marxist/socialist/radical/revolutionary nobody really knew anything about, who literally came out of nowhere and became POTUS. In subsequent elections the people voted in politicians who made promises to fight the changes to our system; however, those promises were rarely kept. The few who kept them were people like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, etc. Now the informed electorate is really ticked off and ready to elect a clean slate. This realization is what started the Tea Party grassroots movement, the same movement that was vilified, ridiculed, and persecuted by the present POTUS.

His unwillingness to even give his political opponents a place at the table from the earliest moments of his presidency haunted him through both of his terms. Trump sees the folly and has already pledged to seat both at the table. This is how the system is supposed to work. Reagan vs Tip O Niel, Clinton vs Gingrich et al.. Rivalries from which great legislation grew that served all Americans. Obamas unfettered arrogance and a complete lack of respect for the seperation of powers was his greatest failure.

The other big takeaway is that it would have been a massacre had there not been an armed security detail present to return fire and kill the assailant.

Now they are beginning to know it isn't going to happen 'big league' quick, but they still believe it will eventually happen, and mostly because they want it to happen so Trump will somehow make it happen.  The fact the Trump is actually working against this belief is never going to matter because he articulated the belief in a way that made it seem like he got it.

It may be that Canadian voters (including Conservatives) served to keep Harper in the centre but it is hard to say.

1,"Despite attempts to divert the topic from Obama to Trump, the reality stands. Obama has become a global laughingstock. His pompous condescension has offended and alienated global leaders to the point of outright disrespect. Not to mention acts of blatant aggression.  He has shown himself to be a toothless lion and is now being treated as such. His behavior on the international stage is (should be) an embarrassment to all Americans. The fact that so many Americans aren't at all angered by it speaks volumes regarding their character. So here we are, forced to choose between electing a buffoon or a traitorous criminal. America has seen her pinnacle come and go, she is in a terminal nosedive.

The final effect was instilling fear and divisiveness based on distortion and political lies that made many voters anxious and impulsive.  The Bernie supporters split the Democratic vote as well, among the younger bloc of voters particularly, who then refused to vote at all.

Any elected official who schemes to take health care away from sick people is doing it to Jesus.  For those who actively support Republican schemes to rob the poor of health care, and thus shorten their lives, Jesus asks (Luke 6:46) ““Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I tell you?”  One waits in vain for an answer from the likes of Paul Ryan and Donald Trump.  It is a great tragedy to see people who are always quick to proclaim in word that Jesus is Lord scouring our Lord with their deeds by denying Him health care.

Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks–Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for $0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen–including Donald Trump–deposited the checks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for $0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump.  Now that's some funny, but true sheit. A fake billionaire cashing a check for 13 cents. That's a LOSER.

Sharing shalt be a choice, for all else is tyranny, and it shalt always be subject to receiving something in return, so that one shalt feel good about oneself. Remember this: the temptation to throw bread crusts at a starving man is frought with peril, for once you give a hungry man free food, he will become dependent upon you.

This is not to say that it is a certainty, because it is inherently speculative to try to say how many voters made decisions based on factor X vs factor Y, etc. But it *could have*, and even if you think it didn't make a difference, it might do so in future.

The US and Russia, including the Soviet Union, have long traded in uranium ore, yellowcake. However, that aquisition is still in the ground in Wyoming, and can only leave the US with permission from the State department, so Putin has nothing but a propaganda score.

A big problem is many illegals who are here are still breaking the law and committing other crimes while here.  Trump is showing heart by going after them first . Legislators could fix this problem if they wanted too

Florida’s Attorney General was considering opening an investigation into Trump University, which is accused of defrauding students. Bondi herself contacted Trump and asked for a political contribution. After a political committee associated with her campaign received the illegal $25,000 contribution, she decided not to pursue it.  The story has something that none of the Clinton Foundation stories have: Actual evidence of illegal conduct. In this case, not only is there concrete evidence that the Trump Foundation broke the law, but a formal finding of wrongdoing by the IRS.  And yet, coverage of the Trump Foundation, even in the few short days since the story of the IRS fine broke, has been scant.

I bet Trump paid close to zero taxes last year, although we don't know since he will not release his return.

I will bet that there is not a single woman in North America - Trump supporter or not - who actually believes that Trump had any role whatsoever in raising those children. Wake up Brian....it's his WIVES who raised those kids.  That man never changed a diaper in his life or read a bedtime story to any of his kids.  It's wives (and no doubt lots of nannies) who deserve all the credit here, if in fact, there is any credit due.

If we are lucky Orange will have to be dragged into it and the 2 sides will chew each other up for another couple years.

0,"The reason Trump and his people are being investigated is because they either lied, forgot, or somehow neglected to fill out their forms correctly.  It is appropriate to do so.  For Clinton to be investigated, at this point, does seem self-serving and has the appearance of creating a distraction to the Trump investigations.  Politics is a dirty business and is really not about ideology.  It is about power.  Pure and simple.  Always has been.  To focus on who did what when is to miss the point.  Follow the money and we'll see who really runs things.

You can hypothesize all you like about what Trump may get from it personally, but it doesn't change the fact that he's staked out a strong foreign policy position that could attract many American voters.

0,"I can no longer take wise people that believe Donald Trump is unqualified to be president because of his private conversation about a woman that he had eleven years ago. These people are sheltered, isolated, secluded, who obviously have never been out of the house. If they decide to come out of their womb and visit society, they would discover that men say rough, crude things, especially in groups (real men, that is). Real men, hunters, football players, soldiers, the tough guys talk tough. Wimps are offended by the language. Trump is a tough guy, not a wimp. He talks brash, self-confident, bold, audacious, brazen, forward, insolent, and sure. Especially when he's with the boys. That really is the type of person to tackle the problems in this country, sure and tough. His language is an indication of his disposition. Anyone who is offended by his private comments 11 years ago are either sheltered or someone just looking for an excuse to criticize Trump. Which group are you in?

Reminds us of the US election of 1948; people said that they would have a hard time voting for Harry S Truman ( the S stands for nothing, by the way ), but that is what they did on election day. It seems that the voting public just didn't trust the Democratic candidate, Governor Adlai Stevenson of Illinois.

If they manage to actually put a missile 40 km off of Guam, I might be a touch more concerned, but even then, not so much.  Trump has been threatening N. Korea since pretty close to his first day in office, how do you expect they would respond?  Of course they are going to flex a bit and threaten back.

The system down there is in the middle of a huge change from fee for service to value based care. Don't know what that is? Neither does anyone else, but it's happening. It shifts some part of the risk from being exclusively on the payor to being shared with the providers. And now with Trump, the direction they've all been rowing in with the ACA is about to change yet again. They have trouble attracting docs into primary care because the workload is too heavy and billing is too complicated. And the complexities of administering Medicare Part D, Medicaid, and multiple commercial payor systems is a nightmare. Plus they have entire departments to deal with collections. Many are leaving their practices to join hospital systems where they give up a lot of control over patient care for the security of a paycheck. Life may be good for specialists, but not so much for the trenches.

I really wonder how low does Trump have to go for Congress to finally kick him out of office. That said, it's a great deflection from the Russian investigation as well as a signal that Trump will pardon those who protect him throughout.  I pray the investigation wraps up swiftly, before Trump destroys everything those of us who love our country hold dear, such as the checks and balances in place for hundreds of years.

About 100,000 Canadians a year, NOW,  move to the US permanently because Canada has limited opportunities and Governments like Trudeau's confiscate their wealth. With Trumps plan, the numbers of highly skilled Canadians emigrating will escalate dramatically.  Canada spends $Billions and $Billions of scarce resources to train these highly skilled professionals. Take physicians for example. Physicians don't have paid maternity care, pensions, benefits or paid sick days . Physicians fund this through their corporation. Yet 2 weeks ago Trudeau imposed huge taxes on these physicians. US gives Canadian MD's reciprocal licensing immediately as training is equivalent. Physicians will easily be able to move to US where they are appreciated and can earn/save much more.

Mr. Trump resurected the Reagan """"Make America Great Again"""" slogan as the centerpiece of his campaign.  It was vague enough that it could mean many different things to many different people and it worked.  He made some very extreme promises to various specific issue voters and now is actually working to deliver on those promises.  My concern is simple:  I feel the actions he's instituted will NOT lead to a better America.  I find his actions, like his words and tweets, divisive and destructive.  Those of us who are critical of his actions and plans for America's future are NOT against improving our nation.....of course not.  We love our nation just as those who support Trump do.

1,"The takeaways are on the individual side while the corporate side, and the wealthiest get huge benefits. GOP greed outweighs the well-being of the American people.  For example: Getting rid of the AMT will save Trump and his cronies tens of millions of dollars, and doubling the inheritance tax cap also will maintain the family dynasties of those at the top of income ladder. Meanwhile the poor will pay more, and deductions for necessities such as those who incur pricey medical expenses are gone.  The states that already contribute the most will be hit hard by the loss of state and local tax deductions as will all of those of us in the middle class who itemize.  This tax plan is a slap in the face to mainstream Americans, but a huge boon to GOP donors. The GOP also is looking at raising the fuel tax, which will raise the costs of food and other goods for us all.  DISGUSTING!

And while Obamacare was raping the middle class,  Obama made sure that Obamacare outlawed selling insurance across state-lines and negotiating on drug prices,  just to help out his friends running the Insurance and Pharmaceutical industries.

(It was the triumph of the space cadet over the space man.)  You see, the arrival of Trump forced Trudeau to shuffle his cabinet and actually put in a few qualified ministers and Garneau who was already transport minister was give the added role of chairing the select cabinet committee on Canada-US relations.  So it was Garneau who invited these chaps.  Trudeau won't even be there.

0,"I thought McMaster's explanation of what happened was reasonable as to how this happened. He said the President was not briefed on the information beforehand and he did not know the sources before he spoke and was not aware of what was classified and what was not. My take is that if he had been aware of the high security attached and the source and concerns attached to the source, and the risks of disclosure, maybe he would not have said what he did to the Russians or would have been more careful. McMasters also said the disclosure was """"appropriate"""" which I take it means it fit the nature of the discussion Trump had with the Russians-- it was appropriate for the discussion. The question posed by the security persons who spoke to the Washington Post has not been answered. Was this a smart thing to do?

I am not an adamant supporter of either candidate, but I do not like the media focus on the personal rather than the substantial issues.  I do like Trump's America first rhetoric.

I don't have time to search for all 34 members of the Council, but I did check out the two clerics on the Council: Deacon Keith Fournier, Chairman of Common Good Foundation and Common Good Alliance; and Father Frank Pavone, National Director of Priests for Life.

Canada has long been a lousy free-trader when it comes to areas like medical services, agricultural products, or simply subsidizing favoured businesses with government grants.  And the US has tired of being the market for all of the worlds cheap goods.  But as the playing field shifts, we are still in the best position to take advantage of the US market, especially if we keep our mouth shut and don't get all preachy about our neighbours.

0,"Two points... 1. I don't think Trump is as disliked in Canada as this contributor lets on. 2. Canada had better take a reality check. To a large degree we are freeloaders. We don't pay our fair share of national defence and economically we rely on the good will of the U.S. which accounts for more than 80% of our trade. The U.S. has been losing jobs and with Trump they are about to start looking after themselves. That is  what they should do and Canadians need to stop whining and start coming up with winning strategies of their own. I don't know if Trump is good for America but if he delivers a wake up call to Canadians he would be doing us a favor. It's about time we got down off the fence and stopped carping and stood up for ourselves. My bet though is that Canadians will remain divided as to what to do because we are so parochial and regionalized  and will whine and blame Trump instead. Justin Trudeau, even though he is a young man, is behind the times.
"
0,"What is all that about """"His party will not let him do it""""???

Independents are not celebrating the dismissal of the Paris Accord, it was in most part pretty important to them. He may not be involved in the investigation, he is interfering with the scope of the investigation that centers on others.

Then they blame it on the Democrats. They are trying to make the ACA fail, and then they claim the ACA is imploding. If the Graham-Cassidy plan passes, and people can't afford health insurance or people with pre-existing conditions see their premiums skyrocket, Republicans will blame liberals and the Democrats.

0,"I am no fan of Justin Trudeau, as regular readers will know.  But I do not find the columnist's attack on Trudeau economic policy to be compelling.  About 20 percent of his column is compelling, where he talks about pipelines and comments about phasing out oil from Alberta. Those indeed are not strong points in Trudeau's record and trajectory.  But the other 80 percent of the column is not very compelling. Yes, Canada is on a frighteningly troubling economic trajectory, but that rests on the shoulders of a third of a century of Ottawa and Provincial governing, not on the sole shoulders of Trudeau.  And Trump is so unpredictable and bombastic, it probably makes little difference, for the upcoming meeting, if Canada was busy implementing the economic plan of Trudeau or Mulcair or Harper, or for that matter, of either Marx - Karl or Groucho.

I promise you, nobody opposed the election of Donald Trump more than I did or was as sickened (literally) by his election. But that said, he was legally elected. The popular vote differential makes for a nice argument against a mandate, but not against his legitimacy. And yes, Russia influenced the election and only the most die-hard Trumpistas don't get that. But unless somebody can prove that Putin stuffed ballot boxes, it won't change anything.  The bottom line is, the guy was elected and all the protests in the world won't make us wake up from that nighmare. So I'm going to hold my nose and try to get through the next four years, supporting policies I agree with (if any) and biding my time until 2020.

But this fraud of a President needs them and he knows it. He's even put them at the heart of his team; characters as loathsome as Bannon and Miller would have no place in the office of any leader with even the slightest sense of decency. So Trump equivocates and evades his responsibility, shrugs and goes back to his golf game.

Like Trump, Gingrich merely drove to power on a road that Limbaugh and his local-market and nationally-syndicated imitators paved in the wake of President Reagan’s elimination of the Fairness Doctrine in August 1987.  How ironic that thanks to Limbaugh and his talk-radio clones, America is now in fact held hostage by a right-wing menace that respects no Constitutional boundaries, a regime that profits from prejudice and prevarication, an entity that demands our flag be worshipped as a quasi-religious symbol.  Trump isn’t behaving any different from the way Limbaugh would have, had he become President.

1,"Her pro-choice voting record and policies notwithstanding, Hillary Clinton, by reason of her advocacy for children, families, and health care, has done more to reduce the number and the rate of abortions in this country than Donald Trump ever has or ever will.  Through most of his life, he has been militantly pro-choice, and while I know people can and do change their minds, when Chris Matthews asked Trump about his evolution on abortion, it was immediately evident that Trump had not given the issue so much as five minutes of thought.  Over the next six hours, he adopted four different positions on abortion. Moreover, no-one who mocks the handicapped can ever be seen as pro-life.  Trump is a racist, fascist know-nothing blowhard.  To describe him as pro-life, to support him or vote for him on the basis of pro-life concerns,is to diminish the pro-life movement and demean those who are genuinely committed to it.

He doesn't care if Canada or Mexico loses 10,000 factory jobs if he could bring those jobs back to America. He sees everything as a zero sum game where there are only winners and losers. By contrast, China likes to talk about a win-win situation where everybody who deals with them comes out happy.  Donald Trump is a nasty businessman who will screw with us if he can get away from it. In Atlantic City, he was notorious for paying only half the invoice from contractors and telling them to sue him. The story is they wised up and simply doubled the estimates to get their money.  We are looking at a potential trade war unless we can talk with his advisors and children. Canada should prepare for hostilities from the United States and ready our own weapons.

0,"We have turned away from reliance on the mainstream news media because 6 corporations control 90 percent of it. What they give us is the establishment view put out by corporations and government, much of which is self-serving and not true.  So we have turned to alternative news and opinion websites such as Common Dreams, and pass links to their articles to each other via social media such as Facebook. We also share personal observations on what is going on around us that we will never read in the RG -- for example police harassment of the homeless to force them out of downtown so merchants can make more money.  Clearly Mr. Hite does not like this. Apparently he wants us to listen to the respectable folks, who do not understand reality, as shown by the election of Donald Trump. The respectable people are part of a closed circle where they only listen to each other. The mainstream news media panders to them by telling them what they want to hear.

That was the extent to which Trump gave himself any mention.  He referred to “we” the American people 45 times over the course of the address, including a string of mentions at the end of his speech, playing off his “Make America Great Again” slogan: “Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

That's when the insurance corps could capitalize on digging into your past and using acne medication or a long ago diagnosis for high blood pressure as legal reason to cut you off. Heartless and cruel but that is the story with the entirety of the GOP caucus who voted for this odious bill that most disapproved of just a month ago. Only 17% of Americans approved of the first version that Young says he would not have voted for and then they made it worse by screwing with the pre-existing conditions access.

And no, it wasn't little Jeffrey Sessions who led the investigations that broke the back of the KKK in Georgia, as you claim. I'm guessing you meant the Michael Donald case that happened in Mobile, which was not in Georgia.  Regardless, Sessions didn't break the back of the KKK in Alabama either, nor did the Donald case for that matter. Sessions was a cooperating prosecutor, and no more, basically meaning he didn't try to obstruct the case.  I'm guessing that you're not a civil rights history buff? Obviously you're mistaking alternative facts with the truth. And repeating them as if they were gospel means that you are lying too, whether you're aware, or not. It's an affliction common to the Trump fan club.  Sessions is a liar, and we have, among other glaring examples, his senate confirmation hearing to prove it.

What we do know is that there was a widespread coordinated attack on the US election by Russian hackers under control of the Russian government at the highest levels. The attack used fake websites, fake news, fake twitter accounts, using robot websites to send millions of tweets and news stories. All key members of congress from both parties have seen a report on this and conclusions agreed to by the FBI and US intelligence on what I said above. You can read a declassified version of the report on the internet and also read the transcript of the Senate Intelligence committee where the report was presented. Also the FBI memo recommending firing Comey also said that when Comey could not accept the decision not to prosecute Hillary, he provided derogatory material on Hillary to Congress including some right before the election--that was another smear on Hillary.

Those opposed to the neo-Nazis and white supremacists do not make such assertions but the opposite. """"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.""""

If you want to pretend that Hillary and Trump are somehow equal in reprehensibleness, you are firmly in the corner of Trump's behavior and should be ashamed of yourself. You want to hand the country to a violent abuser because the experienced, qualified, and respected woman who opposes him just rubs you the wrong way.

1,"For one thing, he promised to revisit and revoke Roe vs Wade. He said he would find a supreme court judge to get it done.  This is a very regressive move, and if you don't understand what it is, or why it is, you don't understand why women marched in such numbers.  He also strongly advocates protectionism. That is so injurious to lower and middle-class Americans  (and beneficial to his wealthy fellow billionaires!) that it should never be allowed to see the light of day.  He uses fear, lies, bullying and deception to achieve his goals. So it's not just what he does, but how he does it that people don't like. They don't just want Trump to stop using his wealth and power to stop grabbing women by the pu$$y, but he's grabbing America by the private parts and they want him to stop right now.  They want him to show respect, speak plainly and honestly, think rationally, and act responsibly. They want Trump to be a president, not an embarrassing and dangerous village idiot.

So, in a way what he did is not all that baffling. - He is unwavering  and immutable so it is no surprise that he pulled a 'Trump' as a guest. That is, he did not stay on point and focus on the purpose of the gathering. Yet, hope beats eternal that he would have not 'Trumped' his host, Jenkins, CSC.

0,"Trump’s speech was one of his best, if not the best.  I especially liked how he went after the media for its biased and unfair reporting of his response to the violence that erupted in Charlottesville.  He did not mince words and told it exactly like I saw the events unfold live on TV for several hours. I believe many people who fault Trump haven’t the foggiest idea of what really happened in Charlottesville and are blindly accepting what they have read in the media, assuming they can read, or what they were told by the anti-Trump media.   The media no doubt left the event licking its wounds.  It will interesting to see how it counter attacks.

Surely you have seen this tendency?  And am I not to point out the hypocrisy in coverage?  It has nothing to do with """"tactics"""" or """"corners"""" - it has to do with truth in reporting.  The constant barrage of anti-conservative, anti-Trump, anti-hierarchy op-eds here are offered as """"reporting"""" - they are not, of course.  Let us ask you the question you ask me - with a slight twist.  """"Why are those, who seemed to love calling (Trump) """"a liar"""", not been calling (Clinton) one?""""

0,"The idea for originally hiring Preibus as Chief of Staff was to keep an eye on Trump and, because Preibus was representing the actual Republican Party, there would some resemblance to actual Republican policy. Preibus was fired because he was caught leaking information to the press, plus he never got along with Bannon. Now that Preibus is out, I wonder how vindictive he will be towards Trump via the Mueller investigation. He was an insider for about 7 months; the ghost of Reince  Preibus may come back to haunt the vindictive Trump. Better than reality television.

He has a long history of public service and gotten pretty good results.  I  do like the person.  Trump has zero experience in public policy of any kind that I know of.   Why that appeals to anybody is beyond me.    I know he has an in your face machismo that we haven't seen in a long time.   I think many people like the aire' of confidence he shows even if it's a half truth or a personal insult.  Hillary doesn't appeal to me either.   I think questions of her lying is stupid and childish to anyone who has even a vague idea of what it means to be a public person, where every expression or utterance of public figure can be distorted.

This guy I know, my not so close neighbours,  in township of Springwater have build over decades a kind of healthy foods, farmers market type of store and supporting business on his farm. Business is now significant in size, well known, and by my opinion it is worth tens of millions. Liberal government of township of Springwater didn't find better place to propose their new waste processing facility than just besides that business. Not to mention water streams down to the place and registered forests that will get destroyed by that facility, slowly but surely.  While they have strongest regulations about environment applied to citizens, that of course does not apply to the government.  At some point I guess we will get Trump alike when they piss off too many people.

0,"Trump could push through a law changing legal personhood under the 14th Amendment, thus altering Roe. He won’t, however, because if they go too far, the GOP will be killed in the polls and in fundraising. If he hits it right, the issue goes away and that also kills the GOP and the Ecumencisim of Hate.  He will likely be rules disabled or impeached, so Pence is the result. Sadly, Pence believes the same things but will be smarter in knowing what can get done and will do them.  In the end, the best thing about Trump is the leftward swing in four years. Socialism in our lifetime.

And augment it with tweets praising him.  And printed-out pictures of himself.  Well, we're all gonna die.  Not much question about it now.  At some point an inkjet printer will break and the staff won't be able to print out pictures of Trump """"looking powerful"""" that day and he'll fly into a rage and start bombing someone.

Most of the Republican Party is financed and owned by big oil and to some extent by big coal and like good little servants of the almighty dollar the politicians do as they're told.  Trump's dealings with Russia are mostly about oil and he stands to make very large sums of money for using his presidential authority to promote fossil fuels.  It's big oil that runs America and they'll enslave the US to fossil fuels until they squeeze the last dime out.  Leaving a livable environment for our children does not matter to them.  Clean air to breathe, clean water to drink?  If it doesn't make oil magnates more money to get tax breaks on, they don't care.

1,"Trumpism is a rational response to the utter failure of the “change” and “don’t change” orthodoxies of the left and right, respectively, to produce civilizational progress and improve living standards in the United States over the past 50 years. It represents a transcendence above all political orthodoxy into a realm of infinite nuance and critical thinking. Put simply, Trumpism is not an ideology but rather a skepticism of all ideology. Trump is the first post-ideological president in American history. He cannot be defined by any political party or coherent ideology. It is precisely this departure from ideology that terrifies ideologues across the political spectrum who built careers around the moral laziness of “change is good” vs “change is evil.” Trump has ended the careers of countless lazy politicians. This explains the vitriol from both the left and the right.

0,"Actually the rich in the higher taxed states will pay more.  The reason why is state taxes are deductible whereas under his plan they won't be.  So if you lived in California where the top rate is 13.3% you would pay (100-13.3)*39.6+13.3 which is 47.6332% whereas under Trump it would be 35% + 13.3% which is 48.3% so a slight increase.  Now if in a lower like Massachusetts it would drop slightly (100-5.1)*0.396+5.1 = 42.6804% whereas under Trump it is 35% + 5.1% = 40.1%.  Although in most states the top rate would come down, ironically New York City where he lives it would go up although with his businesses and eliminating the AMT he would pay less.

Obama care insures that you cannot be rejected for pre-existing conditions when you apply for health insurance.  If she were to resign from office knowing that her stage 4 cancer cannot be cured then she would need to acquire new insurance.  If the Republicans had passed the bill and Trump had sign it then she would not be able to purchase health insurance because the company would reject her because of her stage 4 cancer.  You claim that the Senate would pay 72% after insurance even if she is out of office. That's simply not true. Are you making such a claim?  The above happens to anyone with a serious illness like cancer. The employee stays on the job because if there were to leave that job they will no longer be covered by insurance. This is why we need Obamacare.

Secondly, you caution that Trump is lowering taxes which will make Canada uncompetitive. Really?

I find it interesting that you are also concerned about our National debt. We should be. Which is why having a high tax rate is critical to sustaining our fiscal position.

0,"The policy behind the President's constitutional power to pardon- among other things it prevents harassing prosecutions and complaints against the President's cabinet and staff-- alpplies to the President as well. The only exception in the constitution is that the President cannot pardon impeachable offenses. The constitution is silent on non-impeachable offenses by the President. Therefore, one can argue that the reason to pardon applies to crimes by the President as long as they are not impeachable. But this issue has never been settled-- Trump might be the first to try it. Among the arguments against the pardon or self pardon is where there is presidential obstruction of justice which is an impeachable offense and therefore the self pardon and even a third party pardon may be denied by the court.

This country has been pushed around by war widows for far too long.” Trump said that Senator John McCain, who has mocked the President’s draft-dodging during Vietnam, has “never shown an ounce of courage when it comes to fighting war widows.” “McCain can talk about what he did in Vietnam all he wants,” Trump said. “But the guys who have gone toe to toe with a war widow, contradicted her version of events, and refused to back down—we are the true heroes.”

To be fair, CNN did not state that the story was factual, they only reported that Trump was briefed on the report and its’ contents.    It was an example of the typical Trump approach to spewing non-truths, """"You know, some people say that was not his birth certificate,"""" (he told ABC in August 2013).   It doesn’t really matter if the topic is factual or not, just that “some people” are saying…  My read is Obama's comments about insulating ourselves within networks (social media, newsfeeds, etc) is really what is at play.

I am sure that Morneau would agree with Trump's new tax cut and how it helps the middle class (but really is engineered to give the mega-rich all the major breaks). Won't stop CEOs (like himself and his in-laws the McCain's) from cashing in their 'stock options' and creatively obscuring their tax responsibilities on these options.  Reminds me of the novel 'Animal Farm' where it was stated 'four hooves good but two hooves better'.  Was not Morneau in the 'Panama Papers'? Is not Trudeau's family accounting firm KPMG not in the Panama Papers?  Without transparency their can't be accountability. And this is not what politicians want. Such hypocrites.

0,"Scott, I met a man who had been divorced when he was still a teenager, or early 20's. He took all the blame for what happened. He married again and has been with his wife for over forty years. He couldn't get annulment and married civilly. I did their marriage forty years on. That guy went to Mass every week in those forty years and never took communion. Obviously, he can now.  A forty year sentence for being a stupid young man. He described to me how he felt over all those years. The Eucharist wasn't exactly the core of his being as a teenager. But it's importance grew on him as he faced life's joys and sadnesses. Parents funerals, family weddings, big parish celebrations - no Eucharist. And a big, red arrow pointing at him in the congregation.  No person who actually believes in the Eucharist would be capable of banning another person from receiving it. Burke and his friends really don't believe in Jesus. The difference between him and Trump is that Trump is honest about himself.

0,"""""Silence from the country’s mental health organizations has been due to a self-imposed dictum about evaluating public figures (the American Psychiatric Association’s 1973 Goldwater Rule). But this silence has resulted in a failure to lend our expertise to worried journalists and members of Congress at this critical time. We fear that too much is at stake to be silent any longer.  Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).  In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.""""

The law in America is that the sitting president may issue an order of executive clemency (pardon, commutation of sentence, remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve) for any federal crime. Trump's predecessor, Barrack Obama, issued such orders 1,927 times during his two terms in office.  I don't see anyone condemning Obama for abusing his executive powers of clemency. And that's despite the fact that many of the people he pardoned were drug dealers and similar offenders. In this case, Trump pardoned a long-standing, tough-on-crime US sheriff that was convicted of racial profiling in the course of his duties.  While I think that abuse of power is a serious matter, and that such offences should never be treated lightly, I don't think Trump will lose any votes over his decision.

With John F Kennedy, no longer can an assassin hit a president from an office building because secret service now always control all 'high ground' whenever a president is exposed in public & not in his armored car.  Don't think Chavetz is resigning due to safety concerns.  Chaffetz, Nunes and other Republicans are in full retreat mode. Trump's self implosion has put Repubs like Chaffetz, Ryan & others in a no win scenario in which they cannot defend Trump, yet they cannot side with Demos when Mueller's investigation will eventually require all Repubs to side with Demos to impeach Trump.  Its over, Trump is gone.  If Trump did not fire Comey, Trump might have weathered the storm of his Russian connection problems.  Making Comey his enemy was a fatal mistake

It was an army base.  It had been there for years. We do have surveillance.  I find it hard to believe we were arming good rebels, but fighting bad rebels that were on our side.  What we were doing in Syria was all bullshit lies, Trump was doing the right thing just going after ISIS and getting out.  I question those calling for war in Syria now.  Please explain WTF we were doing there in the first place and what you hope to accomplish?  Iraq anyone?  Remember the lies they made up to attack Iraq?  Laughable Forgeries were used that the UN determined were fake with a 5 minute google search.  The media supported those lies, and you cannot trust them now.

Vancouver and Toronto real estate prices, raised in the article, involve overseas money flooding in, mainly from China in the case of Vancouver, and much from China in Toronto with a mix from places such as Russia and elsewhere.  It is overseas money that gets house prices to skyrocket to dozens of times the average annual local income.

But Trump had undermined the efforts of the rebel coalition and the Obama administration and the world stood by as Assad virtually wiped them out.   Now suddenly Trump sees the light, and considers military action against Assad.  Okay, fine, but his completely spurious and impulsive nature with respect to foreign policy and other issues is revealed each day to have more and more severely damaging consequences.

0,"If it were true that the Democratic Party is operating as a Southern Plantation with masters and slaves, wouldn't African-American voters abandon it?  If it were true, it would be very easy for the Republican Party to change its implicitly racist Southern Strategy to a new Southern Strategy, rewarding African-American votes with jobs, education, and programs.  It hasn't done so, presumably to avoid alienating its base, evangelicals and less educated white people, especially in the South, who the Republican Party itself has treated as closet bigots, justly or not.  I agree that the majority of Americans are hungry for change, although Americans disagree widely about what that change should entail - progress or a return to the past.

What are we supposed to do with all the people arrested?  Cram them into detention centers?  How are we going to get them back to their country of origin? Does anyone expect these immigrants to just turn themselves in? The potential for constitutional violations in search and seizures is endless.

Then, a month or two later, it became known that Rick Wilson (Republican operative) was looking for dirt. The same person gave the hotel story but added the Russian angle given the hacking allegations and the piss angle because Rick's son runs a piss fetish website.

Regardless of what one thinks of the Electoral College, or the fact that Wyoming's' 500,000 people constitutionally stand shoulder to shoulder with California' nearly 40 million, those things are not changing.  Change things to reflect the popular vote? Why? I have repeatedly suggested that Canada become either a unitary state, or go to 5 provinces. If P.E.I.

Wesley Machida, director of Budget and Finance, said federal funding makes up about 20 percent of the state’s $13.7 billion operating budget this year. In all, the state expects to receive $2.7 billion in operating funds from the federal government this year, with much of that money flowing into the Medicaid program to pay for health benefits for the poor and disabled. The public school system will receive about $250 million of that federal funding this year, and $150 million will go to the Department of Health. The federal government will also provide an additional $376 million to the state this year for construction projects, with most of that money going to the state Department of Transportation. That sum amounts to about 15 percent of the state’s total $2.5 billion construction budget, he said. What if all this went away.  Think about It.

0,"Regarding the abolition of the estate tax: During his campaign Trump stated that along with dropping the estate tax, he would also get rid of step up valuation at the time of death. Under current law, if your parent dies and leaves you the long time family home  and you sell it, your basis in the home is the value of it on the day they died, rather than what they bought it for.  This means that you will not show a gain from the sale and will have no taxable income from it. If Trump sticks to his plan to get rid of the ability to step up the basis, then when you sell the home that your parents bought a couple decades ago, you will likely show a significant taxable gain. Of course, Trump has also talked about getting rid of the capital gains tax at every income level, so in that case no one pays anything... This is something to watch as they reshape the tax code, as for many the only real asset they have is their home and it could be a downward shift in taxes.

There is no need to work with such people but calling for this (your quote) """"anyone who likes that kind of speech, to be put aside and ignored"""" soundly violates ALL of our rights to Free Speech, to which we are ALL entitled to, equally.  Have a good day. MAGA!

0,"I agree that the dispute settlement process needs reforming, but I trust that Trump doesn't expect us to accept the jurisdiction of American courts or tribunals. As the softwood lumber disputes prove, American courts and tribunals are very heavily biased in favour of American businesses.; Canada lost almost every softwood lumber case that was dealt with by an American tribunal and won almost every case that was heard by a neutral international tribunal.  My view is that NAFTA should have a permanent dispute resolution court, with judges approved by all three governments, appointed for fixed, non-renewable terms of great enough length to insulate against short term political turmoil.  That court should have original jurisdiction over all trade disputes that NAFTA applies to; national tribunals like the American CCITT should be cut out of the process altogether.

Clinton could have flipped any two of those aforementioned States and Trump STILL would have won.(Trump didn't even need Florida)  Using a football analogy, Trump won by at least three or four scores(even if Clinton was in the Red Zone a bunch of times).

Trump exacerbates the racist divisions he & his white supremacists bring to the surface, targeting specific players and all blacks, a path to violence with any blood on his hands alone.  Trump risks millions of lives baiting Jong-un, & also endangers the players, & all who support their cause.  I support the players, who do so much for our communities, and want to raise awareness of the rotten apples whose actions endanger the heroes, the brave and dedicated officers, who risk their lives to make our communities safer.  Trump spurs division based on color, religion, sexual orientation, misogyny & more at both the domestic & global levels. I pray the GOP stops this horror, or Mueller convicts before Trump's damage is irretrievable.  Sadly, it may already be too late. Even if convicted & out of office, Trump has put us at risk of the internal wars now experienced in the Mideast. No doubt Putin's overjoyed. I know I'm heartbroken.

It's the stronger double-fencing, the electronic measures, the additional agents that should make up the vast majority of it.  I think there's an outside chance D's will give in on that to get DACA, although they'll spin it as stopping terrorists instead of illegals.  Fine, that's the way the game is played.  I agree that mandatory e-Verify needs to happen. Both sides have political reasons for continuing to stonewall that one.

I'm not exactly sure how you recount touch-screen voting since there are no paper ballots. Pennsylvania voters have complained before of the touch-screens record their votes wrongly, usually defaulting to the Democratic candidate. Happened in other states in 2012, too.

The rest of the world seems confused, maybe he will be successful and a force for good for America or maybe he is the cartoon the Left has depicted. Maybe  we will have to wait and see.  For me I am feeling more disappointed and disgusted in us, yes us as in all of us. Acting in ways that are hard to understand let alone understand. It's like we are drugged and not ourselves.  Colleges and businesses arranging therapy for the """"distraught"""". 70% of us disgusted with Congress, change wanted, change happened, now 50% complaining about change.

According to the disclaimer for the specific survey mentioned, """"Respondents for this non-probability survey were selected from the nearly three million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day."""" In short, that means no value whatsoever should be given to their results, unless you count entertainment value. Perhaps the Register-Guard does, but for their own reasons doesn't choose to reveal that to its readers when they choose to use such a survey in forming their editorial opinions. For shame.  Also, it's referred to properly as the Medal of Honor. Congress authorized the President to award the Medal of Honor, but otherwise has no part in awarding it other than funding it. People can place whatever value they wish upon these most valorous men speaking in support of Mr. Trump. Many regular soldiers seem to support him as well.

Cannot lead in the face of abject misery caused by weather, through bombast and jerkishness.  The bombast and jerkishness was totally backfiring on him anyway.  Moderating himself makes eminent sense politically.  He becomes a more effective President, and history treats him kinder.  The problem is that he's still a Narcissist.  So, whatever progress he makes as a leader by this current move, which will increase and last for the short-term foreseeable future, is always at risk of just imploding.  America's big mistake, and specifically the mistake of liberals/progressives/Democrats, would be to get too far into bed with Trump.  He's a pretty ill individual.   His decisions are governed by that illness.  He still needs to be removed by Congress, even if he starts acting moderate.  The focus has to be on the danger of him having the nuclear football.
"
0,"In no sense is that divestiture or a blind trust. For legal and actual purposes, Donald Trump would still be in control, and with his world-wide holdings, that would be a clear conflict of interest. To avoid conflict of interest (corruption, emoluments, which are unconstitutional) Trump must either divest or put all his business holdings into a blind trust, meaning that he can't know what he has or what is being done with his holdings. In his case, that would be nearly impossible.  For years you have been saying that the Clintons are corrupt. Now that it's Trump, you are happy to turn a blind eye to actual corruption and collusion with foreign governments for personal profit. Why is that?

Some would argue that all the shilling convinced many people who did not want Donald to win that they didn't have to vote for Hillary either. In an election that was more about who you didn't want to win than who you did, that was  important. Some estimates had Trump out lying Hillary 3:1 - out lying Hillary takes some doing.  Typical Margins of error in the pre-election polls were 5%, so their prediction that Hillary would win the popular vote was correct, but within the margin of error.  The problem occurs when you try and overlay the electoral college expectations because the margin of error is larger in the smaller subsets - up to 10% in some states.  Trump picked up 75 electoral votes in States whose margin of victory was less than 1.25%  (including Florida)- less than the number of voters who voted for the 4th candidate in those states.

Deficit with Mexico pales in comparison with China's. Trump could be a good president, but I see that his presidency will be a terrible winding road. He started wrong, attacking its neighbor, a friend and third biggest partner, instead of attacking its real Enemy, CHINA. We will see.

Have you ever even considered that possibility?  Has it ever crossed your mind?  That maybe the things that you believe make him obviously worse than Clinton might not actually make him worse than Clinton?  That those things might be less important than Hillary's faults?  Just a thought.  But I digress, your problem is not one of ignorance, but rather, rationality.  Simply put, you're too emotionally invested in politics to think rationally about politics.  The religious are similarly incapable of thinking rationally about religion.  You can't step back for a moment and reflect on your political beliefs, question them, and think critically about them.

While that was a goal for Republican lawmakers, it’s important to note these bills made it to Trump’s desk through a process made possible by the Congressional Review Act, which became law in 1996. The act gives Congress a narrow window to reverse regulations, so these 13 bills had to get through Congress within Trump’s first 100 days.""""  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/27/sean-spicer/trump-has-signed-more-bills-100-days-any-president/

0,"I liked the first President Bush and found it shocking he lost his second term.    To win a major conflict on foreign soil, protect American interest, and defend an ally should have been huge.  But his own party defeated him (as the Democrats are close to doing), because he wasn't 'muscular enough in not squishing Iraq and that he recognized he had a huge deficit and had to roll back previous tax cuts (a move that President Reagan also dd by the way.  A move that President Clinton did and managed to balance at least one years budget with a Republican congress).  Bush may have been the most qualified candidate in terms of government experience and inter department knowledge we've had in my lifetime.   And yes, I think his performance was superior to the work of H. Clinton.  Trump has a very thin resume.    The 'corporate' rule that says a good manager can manage any company is nonsense (and proven as such).   The best managers have intimate knowledge of their product/service.

I never saw any violence perpetrated by tea-partiers. I saw some intimidation by folks who disagreed with the tea party. I saw a few videos showing opposition groups physically attacking tea-party folks. I also saw some Occupy groups destroy private property.  To a large extent, the failure of the tea-party movement to affect peaceful mitigation of Obama's crushing of the middle class is the reason why Trump is the GOP nominee for president.

The story seems to indicate that the man is following the rules and is somehow a victim but he made the decision to enter illegally and stay here.  If he is ultimately deported, that $66k is going to buy him a nice house in his home country.  Finally, the complaint that the Trump administration is changing the priority for who to deport. He was easily caught by ICE which sort of makes him a target of convenience.The administration has targeted gang members and other violent criminals but anyone with a removal order is subject to deportation no matter what process they are  going through.  Personally, I hope that he is legally deported, that he goes home and then works to gain legal status and comes back through the proper channels.

It is ok for POTUS to sometimes lie because the American public does not need to know everything.  If my daughter claims to make a billion dollars and she only made a few hundred million when she is a grown woman...no I don't really care.  I don't care who The President sleeps with as it is none of my business, just as it is none of your business with whom I or my wife sleeps and none of mine of yours.  If he doesn't fulfill all his campaign promises, I am cool with that.  In fact there is plenty I don't agree with the President as I can think for myself. It is fine if you want to have Saint in office but Saints are usually Saints because someone walks on them in some way.  That being said, I am fine with Trump not letting countries like France, Germany, China, Iran and Syria walk all over us as they have the past 8 years. Have a nice 4th of July!

And that was a serious concern of the security people who were to brief him. He skipped out without any idea of what was what.

0,"Watching the German reaction at rather closer quarters than most commentators here (whether they be in Toronto or St. Petersburg), I am impressed by the calm way Germans have responded to the Berlin tragedy. While the extremists may gain a few votes, I believe that reason will prevail. As pointed out elsewhere by Gwynne Dyer, the number of casualties from terrorist attacks is very small compared with the cumulative daily toll from traffic accidents, to which one can add the """"usual"""" crimes occurring in any sizable country. Terrorists want, and generally get, extreme over-reaction, yet the probability of being a victim of terror is very small (which is not to dismiss the terrible pain of those affected). Germany has learned the terrible cost of unwarranted action against other groups and nations. It is tragic that the US did not do so after  9/11 and its aftermath, and now Trump threatens to do worse, a pawn in the geopolitical games of Putin and the Sunni/Shia division.

0,"Personally, I doubt there is more to discover about Trump and Russia. My concern is what we already know and how Trump has responded, which is symptomatic of the man.  We know for a fact that Russia tried to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, not only through hacking but also through a massive, sophisticated misinformation campaign. No, I don't think Trump colluded with the Russians or even knew about it then, but he did take full advantage of the chaos caused by their activities.  But now that he does know what happened, Trump still stubbornly refuses to acknowledge it. His ego simply won't allow him to accept that his election may have been tainted by the mischief of a foreign government. That's a major problem.

0,"Cool story bro.  While it is technically true that no one has produced video or audio proof of Gorka actually calling for anti-Semitic action, it is CLEAR from his words both on television and in articles that he supports groups who DO espouse anti-Semitic beliefs.... 'warning' someone that anti-Semitism night not be a wise policy politically is NOT the same thing as condemning anti-Semitism.  Also, under ANY OTHER Republican President, Gorka might have some small chance of surviving, since it is unlikely that charges of anti-Semitism would have much merit  toward an administration that offers enormous support for Israel. Donald Trump,however, is another story. He is already reeling from accusations of bigotry, racism, misogyny and religious hatred toward any 'non-Christian' group.... so Gorka had to go.... Maybe next time don't nominate and elect someone with so little moral character, and then you won't have to have a crisis every time an aide says something that seems bigoted...

Lets ignore the fact that Obamacare premiums are increasing by up to 25%, combined with the fact that Hillary wants to salvage that plan with no idea of how to control the price and increases. It will fail, or it will be paid for by the government via increased taxes to everyone.  Trump proposed removing the state lines divisions which keep companies out of certain states. By doing this, it will allow growth by smaller insurance companies, thus creating competition for the large companies and hopefully reduce healthcare costs. This is actually a very logical fix that will help get costs down.  But by all means, lets continue to bash him for his original idea to reduce health care costs for the alternative of guaranteed cost increases.

TRUMP is the best thing that has happened to our country since Reagan!!  By far!!  You should concentrate more on your problems with the train to bankruptcy than trashing Trump.

Who hasn't felt the short term exhilaration of just 'letting it all out,' all the self doubts, the lack of personal power, the frustration and guilt of past failure — fading for a few moments while you purge your guilt/fear in that moment of emotional release.  Trump has learned some basic truths of human nature, good and bad, and used those skills to make himself a very wealthy and powerful person.   But risk taking is only one of many traits found in happy/successful people, most of whom do not demean the lives of others.  Americans have to ask if the character of Trump, which has served Donald Trump well, will now serve the entire community of our country well.

Privately no doubt he's in Trump's corner, until and unless the wheels fall off Trump's wagon.  Harper clearly endorses Trump's notion that the U.S. should ignore friends and allies that don't bring 'real assets' to the table. Trump means military assets of course, the purchase of which would bolster America's 'military industrial complex', invigorate its economy, and reinforce its standing as undisputed superpower.

I get all kinds of razzing, it doesn't bother me to the point I have to deal with it, and I hope that others, in the security of old age and the abandonment of most ambition, are at least as secure. It sounds as though you have a special deal - you rate five selected posts on your own schedule. Everyone else has to rate 3-5 selected posts before EACH of their posts can be accepted for publication. So if I write a post, I have to evaluate 3-5 posts before I can be published. Then a follow-up comment goes through the same 3-5 evaluations. If I post 10 comments, I have to evaluate 30 to 50 comments in the context of the post to which they replied. In what way do you think you haven't got a special deal?

The operative came under scrutiny from officials at the FBI and the State Dept partly because of at least two trips he took to the U.S. during the presidential campaign.  The joint Russian-Ukrainian citizen who trained in the Russian army as a linguist, told investigators in Kiev and Washington that he met with Manafort during an April trip to the United States. And, after a late summer trip to the U.S., the agent suggested that he had played a role in gutting a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform that would have staked out a more adversarial stance towards Russia, according to a Kiev operative.

All Xi had to do was give his trademark smirk and utter the politically correct remarks about climate change;  the easily duped Euros were his to manipulate.  Never mind that a gas mask is required kit in any big PRC city because the pollution is so bad.  Trump, by contrast with Xi, has rude handshakes and boorishly pushes European leaders aside to be in the first row for the photo op;  he should have said that he had concerns about the Paris Accord and wanted to re-negotiate, not pull out as well as definitely supporting Article 5.  Clearly, the U.S., Japan, the Rok, and Australia are facing a severe crisis with Kim's WMDs as well as the DPRK's BFF, China, which is aiding Kim and taking over the world's key sea lanes.

Dresser has every right to plead for some compassion for her long suffering nation. It also seems to be true that the US is making their misery much worse by fighting a war on drugs in Mexico The US has a long egregious history of making Latin Americans suffer for the sake of American economic interests. Canadians have been fairly sympathetic to the plight of Cuba, why not Mexico?

If the court rules in favour of upholding Trump's travel ban, it will encourage further legislation by executive fiat which bypasses Congress, through which most legislation should rightfully be enacted. If Trump loses, it will permanently impair the ability of the government to enact legislative restrictions to the entry of classes of prospective immigrants and refugees, regardless of whether there are legitimate reasons based on national security or other potential justifications. The world is a pressure cooker with vast numbers of migrants escaping overpopulation, climate change, and religious extremism.

Palestinian human rights fall under both ethnic and religious human rights and was an important issue due to the strong pro-Israel / anti-Palestinian stance of both the Republican and the Democratic parties.  Many Bernie Sanders supporters did not vote for Hilary Clinton because of her strong support for the right wing of Israeli politics, thanks to huge financial contributions from Zionists like Haim Saban and Sheldon Edelson, A women's right to abortion is of course very important for any women's movement, but close to three million people marched on Saturday for a  lot more than just that.

0,"How telling that my comments are regularly flagged by the usual righties, the ones who can dish it out but can't take it... So again, I was calmly pointing out that their hero Trump handles """"free speech"""" at his rallies by shouting down any protesters and urging their instant and brutal expulsion, his mob gleefully endorsing his directives. I was also pointing out to the alt-right lads and their enablers that """"free speech"""" has never been an absolute, e.g. yelling """"fire"""" in a crowded theatre, and that if their own properties were overtaken by lefties with automatic weapons who advocated violence against them and their families, they might better understand these things. Alas, such subtleties are lost on the simple-minded.

0,"Any illusion that NAFTA is a tri-national free trade association ends if Canada and the US proceed in the manner described in this article.  In its place will be the US with two binational free trade agreements, each with much smaller economies and both agreements roughly stitched together.  This is not the way to manage trade and development covering North America; especially for Canada and Mexico.  If the US (with a complicit Canada) essentially dictates terms to a weakened Mexico, Canada becomes isolated and has a hostile Mexico.  The revised NAFTA (or whatever the new post current NAFTA interlocking set of agreements is called) would lack a necessary basis of goodwill between its 3 partners to function adequately and the supply chains linking companies and industries in Canada to Mexico will be subject unduly complex and tenuous administration and protection.  Further, when the Trump administration later makes unreasonable demands on Canada, Canada will face this threat alone.

Not because I'm a liberal or elite, but because I'm a concerned thinking citizen, worried about the future of this country. When I read your statement """"It is far better to consider each proposed action, undistorted by misrepresentation or hyperbole,..."""" it reminded me of this passage from Trump's book, 'The Art of The Deal' “I play to people’s fantasies. . . . People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and it’s a very effective form of promotion.” As near as I can tell almost everything Trump says (and seems to believe) is distorted by misrepresentation and hyperbole.

Many crops would probably rot in the fields because few native born Americans are willing to work for hours in the blazing sun at minimal wages. Few of the angry Trump supporters are willing to take the jobs done by Latinos, legal and illegal.  They prefer to collect their welfare checks.  Those who are working in this country do not collect welfare, although  pervasive lies about this were spread by the Trump camp.  Every person I see who is doing lawn and garden work,  who are doing the nastier and/or more dangerous jobs - roofing, raking hot tar on roads in the summer heat, etc, are all Latinos.  Those who want them all deported will probably be the first to complain when they see what happens if all 11 million are deported.   As the saying goes, be careful what you wish for.

I doubt there aren't restrictions on the essayists, but even if that's the case, they're working for the owners of this site. We aren't. A comment forum isn't an entitlement, and if it's draining away resources then it's understandable to seek an alternative. Many sites do away with comments altogether, but perhaps NCR figured if they did so they would lose a lot of traffic.  I agree the journalistic standards and depth of sensibility at NCR often leave much to be desired. I, too, skip many of the writers, and whole sections for that matter.

As you indicate, the initial contact was from someone who did claim the involvement of a Russian government official who had information that would help Trump. He suggested a phone call and later meeting to which Trump (Jr.) agreed. * As I stated earlier, I don't think that there is anything in the email that tells what Trump believed. They were told something, and explored it, and it turned out to be bogus. The initial June 3 email, from which you have quoted above, in retrospect, looks bizarre. From what Trump has said, it looked to him like a phony bait and switch, to get to talk about the Magnitsky Act. Some are also speculating that it was an actual deliberate set-up. * In hindsight, in the current Russia hysteria, it looks like it should have been reported at the time.

For Tillerson and Cohn, they still have business lives to lead after Trump goes away.  So, they walk a fine line between staying and leaving, trying to characterize themselves as devoted to the principles of American civil liberties, and sticking around out of patriotic duty (implicitly, to prevent Trump from taking America over the edge into the abyss).  It is also, however, a sign of just how isolated Trump has become.  He HAS to capitulate to open criticism of not only his personally expressed views on American governmental policy, but now upon his personal character.  If he doesn't capitulate, the embarassment is just too great, and the narcissistic China Syndrome occurs.  We're talking mental institution.  Catatonic state.  or. . . gotta hang out only with the sort of base dwellers who attend his rallies - which would be gross.

Trumps a blow hard, willing to put a nation at risk based on his own reactionary tendencies.   It's easy to run your mouth about what you might do, quite another to lead a nation to real action.

Americans pay twice what Canadians pay for health care and get an inferior product.  Americans live shorter lives, are sicker, have a higher infant mortality rate and, this is my favorite, have, as their highest cause of personal bankruptcy, medical bills due to catastrophic illness.

In October: FISA request. The Obama administration submits a new, narrow request to the FISA court, now focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks. No evidence is found — but the wiretaps continue, ostensibly for national security reasons, Andrew McCarthy at National Review later notes. The Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services.

More likely it was to find dirt on anti-establishment candidates, or people that the sponsors deemed not conservative enough.  A look-back at Kristol's positions would likely help ID the candidates he, Singer and others involved didn't like. 2)  It is not clear whether the disclaimer was inserted in the article after the first two paragraphs had already been published.

While the specific amount Trump inherited from his father has not been revealed, a January article from the New York Times shows that Trump's will divided $20 million after taxes among his living children including Donald. Further, in 2003, it was reported that Donald and his siblings sold a portion of their father’s real estate holdings for around half a billion dollars. In addition to this inheritance, Trump’s father helped the mogul financially throughout his lifetime by giving him loans and access to trust funds, and establishing a wealth of real estate and political connections for his son.

There is no reason why the President should not be vigorously working to protect our democracy, nor why every American should not be vociferously calling for him to do so - just based on what is already known.  I find it odd that you ask the questions you do. How can you not already be aware of these things that are widely reported and confirmed? Or... you really are siding with Russia. Those are the only 2 choices to explain your comments, so which is it?

0,"I've had the same thing happen to me.  The Romney sign on the back of my truck was slashed a number of times when he ran .  I learned my lesson---My Trump sign is covered with plexy-glass so it can't get slashed.  That didn't stop one person as I went inside the Dimond Center to watch a movie . Someone taped a a paper on my sign saying """" feel the bern """" .  It was easily removed.   Conservative signs were ripped to shreds two elections ago across Anchorage .  Don Young signs were the favorite target until Debonski ran against Berkowitiz . Then they targeted  her , and complained after she caught someone in the act by saying she carried protection. Liberals were mad at her---not the vandals .  You never hear of conservatives trying to shut down Sanders and Clinton gatherings , yet both target Trump , trying to disrupt and shut him down.  They are all for free speech unless a conservative is doing the talking .

0,"They are lying. First off, they claimed they lost their motor and the mast had issues. Look at pix 8. Both fore and back stay are good. You can see both spreaders with cables through them and a sailor is climbing it. Even if they lost jib or main halyards, the other was good and on these boats, it is easy to put up the backup halyard. Then they are claiming squalls where sats show none was at. Add in their ability to sail to Xmas island and wanting to go there, means that they had nav capabilities.  Something is up. I would drill a few holes into the boat where they added fiberglass. I suspect they will find something useful.  These women are going to be found to be as bad as trump for telling the truth.

From Jan. 20 to Sept. 19, the Trump administration authorized 77 military flights, while the Obama administration allowed 94 flights during the same time period, according to the stats.

Mainstream media coverage of all things political has turned from journalism to political advocacy and everyone knows it.  There are myriad examples of deliberate quote mining and misrepresentation everywhere.  CNN is no angel (deliberately cutting feeds, omitting key context, etc), but neither are most of the media outlets (eg. Fox is probably just as bad).  Their recent ploys at controlling the message by encouraging consumers, companies like Facebook, and governments to censor and regulate news in their favour would be palpably laughable if it wasn't a direct slap in the face for freedom of expression and peoples' right to hear all viewpoints.  Their bid for control smacks of the recent religious ploy at the UN to make blasphemy a hate crime.

He said his only source for all the emails was from inside the DNC and given yo Wikileaks on the Campus of American University.  The curious thing about all this is that the CIA refuses to brief the proof of Russian Interference in this election to the Congressional Intelligence Oversight Committee as required by law.  The Obama Administration told us last time that Benghazi was the result of a anti Jihadist video and a spontaneous demonstration  not a planned terrorist attack.   I suppose the demonstrators just happen to bring along a lot of 60 mm mortars and and shoulder held RPGs.  They obviously lied again.

Of all current figures on the political scene, President Trump, is one of the most interviewed, and followed, a media 'darling'. Today's media love to suggest, that everything we knew previously, is false, because it must fit their narrative of evil. Twisting and ignoring the truth. Hammering and yammering, not understanding, why the lies don't stick, and his base is unmoved. Certainly, the reasons suggested, that President Trump, has no right to be patriotic to the American flag, (because of bone spurs, I recall), he did not go to the war in Vietnam, however, those of us that lived through that time, the contentious turbulent 60's, do any of us expect the kids of today, to understand, Lyndon B.

People should go home feeling like they have accomplished something, it is very important for the nation's self-esteem, not to mention the individual's.  Courses on how to protest should also be taught in public schools starting in middle school.  A student should not be given a high school diploma until they have successfully passed all protest courses and participated in a minimum of ten protests.  Protesting president Trump will be granted double points making it possible to graduate with only five protests.

It's time to stop pretending that there actually is a real choice. Is it the perfect plane for Canada? Probably not. But if Canada is going to have a functional small airforce (capable of intercepting fighters and bombers) it needs to be stealthy with excellent sensors. China and Russia are developing their own stealth fighters which will be sold abroad reasonably soon. Frankly, once stealth is involved, you either have it or you don't.  Those that don't invariably lose unless you create artificial and unrealistic scenarios like putting a gen 4 plane right behind a gen 5 plane in visual range and yell go!  That being said, I think Canada is probably better off purchasing C rather A F-35's. Compatibility with existing tankers, extra range and the ability to land on shorter runways trumps the improved performance of the A.

Sane people however understand that the testimony given by Comey had two critical points. One that Trump tried to get him to drop the investigation into Flynn's ties to Russia, which would be obstruction of justice if proven. Hopefully Trump does have the tapes he threatened Comey with. The second thing is that Comey repeated unequivocally that Russia did interfere with the American election, something that Trump trolls continue to try to deny. And also something Trump showed no concern about. Not a single question about a foreign nation sabotaging their democracy. We now await the results of the rest of the investigation to see to what extent, if any, the Trump team colluded with the Russians, which would be treason. It ain't over by a long shot, trolls.

0,"It’s easy to get caught up in the deeply flawed character of Donald Trump. We also need to recognize the policy catastrophe of this presidency. This past week Trump ordered an end to the Obama-era executive action that shielded around 800,000 young undocumented immigrants – often called Dreamers – from deportation under what’s been known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Look at other of Trump’s recent policy decisions and you see the same arbitrary and unnecessary cruelty. What’s the point of banning transgender people from military service? Of siding in court with a businessman who doesn’t want to sell his services to gay couples? Of weakening the standard for responding to sexual violence in universities? Of banning Syrian refugees and reducing by half the number of refugees admitted to the United States? There is no point, in terms of policy. None of these decisions makes America safer or economically stronger or fairer.

0,"This is what I can't understand about Trump's followers, William. It is not about his policies, to the extent that he has any. What I don't understand is that you're willing to believe every story told by her enemies about one candidate, even though she's been cleared by all the congressional committees and agencies that investigated her; but you're not willing to believe Donald Trump when he tells you with his own mouth precisely what kind of man he is. He has told you that he is a sexual abuser, in his own words; that he enjoys mocking handicapped people and characterizing people by the ethnic group that they belong to; that he likes to see violent eruptions in his campaign rallies; that he loves war, wonders why he can't use nuclear weapons. These are not stories told by others (although others have confirmed them) but by his own mouth. Yet you won't believe him, but you will believe stories told by her enemies about Hillary Clinton?

0,"@shoshanab:    you miss my point.    Why should the old guy's recreational use of the lake automatically trump my recreational use of the lake?   If you follow the logic of the regulation then we need another regulation prohibiting power boats on the lake simply because I like to take a swim twice a year.  To further the point, when the old guy is flying his plane it is very obvious.  If a drone is kept in-sight and under 300 ft there is no chance of any conflict.  But the regulation still places a blanket prohibition on use of the drone.  There are large numbers of canada geese, on the lake.   Any one of them would pose a more significant hazard to the float plane than a recreational drone.  Ask Capt Sully about that risk.

1,"The sensationalist media is starting to make me sick.  This is not a """"Muslim Ban"""".  This is a ban on refugees, travel, and immigration from countries that are rife with terrorists.  Unfortunately for Muslims, pretty well most terrorism is in Muslim countries.  How do you tell a """"radicalized Muslim extremist with terrorist intentions"""" from a """"peaceful Moderate Muslim""""?  Simple answer:  you can't.  Maybe if you waterboarded them or tortured them you might be able to tell the difference - if you were lucky.  That would have the unfortunate collateral damage of subjecting tens of thousands of completely innocent people to enhanced interrogation techniques.  I'll give a Mulligan: It was US interventionism by Bush and Obama that caused this disaster in the first place.  Bush invaded Iraq, and Obama invaded Syria and Libya and sat idly by while Saudi Arabia invaded Yemen.  If the US just minded it's own business and stopped practicing """"regime change"""", Trump would not have done this.

We in Hawaii, being prone to hurricane disaster damage, maybe WANT the Fed to have a policy of fully paying for rebuild and replacement of all losses.  But, that's not realistic in any way for our Federal Government.  This is a tricky situation.  Trump needs not overplay his hand on this.  And he needs to QUIT looking so happy that there's a disaster to co-op into positive publicity.  Eventually, what the Fed does will simply not be enough.

But the conspiracy was proven.  It needs to be reconciled or the democratic party will lose the left wing.  Especially in Hawaii where locals and holes connect on the left around environmental and cultural issues.  The unions are losing grace, credibility, membership and participation levels.  I see them not working during campaign season.  Last cycle the unions put an attack add out on a council member, listing all the unions and business organizations against her.  I thought it was a really powerful add, but the council member she still won like naaaaden.  If you think liberals are going to """"get back to the business of getting our candidates elected"""", and work for the democratic party during the general election, you are about as in touch with reality as the republican nominee.

Nevertheless Lawrence Martin is right on point with his observation that Brian Mulroney could play an influential role for Canada dealing with the new Trump administration on NAFTA and other issues connected with Canada-US trade and the environment.  Mr. Mulroney is the most widely respected former Canadian PM around the world - with Stephen Harper second - and nowhere more so than in the US and as PM he achieved great progress for Canada on the trade and environmental fronts dealing with the Reagan and the Bush #41 administrations.  So The Chin has the reputation, credibility, personality and negotiating skills plus the long personal relationship with The Donald (their West Palm Beach houses are about a block apart albeit Brian's is much, much smaller) to be useful to PM Trudeau and Canada in an informal ambassadorial/advisory role.

Some of it makes sense, like requiring NATO to meet their treaty obligations regarding 2% of their GDP and troops rather than having the US bear the brunt of NATO.  Discouraging illegal immigration in favor of legal immigration makes sense to me.  The people doing it legally should get preference over those who don't.  Trying to stop the revolving door of criminals who commit crimes here and then get deported and then come right back to commit more crimes makes sense to me.  Reducing the bribes by the State Department to places like Afghanistan makes sense to me.

Also, many Democrat & GOP politicians will campaign in the midterms on the anti-NAFTA issue and Trump will want to appear at the head of the pack.

0,"The corporate tax cut is straightforward and people understand what it is and what it is aimed at. It is to return over a $ Trillion in cash horded overseas by a handful of US Corporations. I read final draft of what investment analysts are saying about the impact of the cut. One conclusion is that Trump is right that the corporate rate needs to be lowered to 15% and even lower because of the tax reduction devices corporations now use to lower corporate tax to 15% plus the return on the cash that comes from share value and favorable credit that lets corporations “access” the value of those funds tax free through stock appreciation and super low cost borrowing. The other conclusion is that if the funds were enticed back to the US,  when  looking at returns on investment, investing in plants and hiring in the US will have a short term negative return plus risk vs keeping overseas production. Higher returns come from buying back shares with small sustainable dividends to shareholders

I couldn't tell you what she stood for except, I assume, 8 more years of Obama's policies of high health insurance rates, reduction of the workforce, low wages, open orders, continued outsourcing of jobs overseas, empowerment of our global enemies, and wasted time and money on people with sexual confusion.  See, you are all about identity politics.  Look at how you describe Trump and how you ignore what he campaigned on.

From Snopes:  Although the price of Starbucks stock fell slightly that day, however, the change mirrored a dip in prices across the stock market as a whole resulting from President Trump’s executive order on immigration, Fortune reported: President Donald Trump’s decision late on Friday to sign an executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries to the United States for 90 days is causing a minor selloff as investors take gains after a post-election rally in stocks and the U.S. dollar.  On 30 January 2017, the day the #BoycottStarbucks hashtag went viral, Starbucks stock opened at $56.00 and closed at $55.90   I believe it's currently around $58.

0,"It's true, if the ACA is """"repealed and replaced"""" - and that's still up in the air, I think - neither I nor anyone in the media nor anyone I have spoken to has a clue about what would replace it. I have read several columnists who say the repeal would be harder than most people seem to think. And indeed, if repealed entirely but not replaced with something at least as good, up to twenty million insured would immediately lose their health coverage. People are worried, especially those with ACA plans who have expensive pre-existing conditions. A lot of blacks and Muslims worry about a new wave of persecution. And there is much more that's up in the air. Millions of women marching against Trump do so because of the general disrespect he showed them. The Mexican peso is tanking because of worry about Trump yanking a lot of jobs out of Mexico, and charging Mexico for a 60 billion dollar wall, while returning 11 million unemployed Mexicans. People worry with good cause.

0,"Did we """"vet"""" the Irish immigrating or visiting the US when the IRA was at it's most active?.. This is another outrageous statement made by a man doesn't realize yet that he will not be President.

I so hope I am wrong.

0,"That is an astute statement that's worth considering. Hitler had """"referent power"""" (ie. charisma) over his people and military, and that is exactly why he was able to convince a nation to back his genocidal plans. Trump, obviously, doesn't have any charisma...so his bases of power is not nearly as influential as Der Fuehrer's. Trump was elected because he was the least of the two evils (at least, that's why I voted for him), not because he was the best person to lead this country.

0,"Trump does not have to start a shooting war with China to get his way. He can impose trade barriers just like the US has against Canadian softwood lumber and ratchet them up slowly. I expect he will, just as he will move to renegotiate NAFTA. He must move on the trade front before his supplicants lose faith and turn against him. He has a year at most to produce something substantive.  BTW, what does Beijing think about this situation, other than the official name calling and saber rattling?

0,"It's about time this country joins the rest of the world's developed countries in enacting universal healthcare as a right for all. Medicare works.

Otherwise, as democratic countries, they would've scrapped their system long ago.  Democratic Socialism is no longer a taboo two words, thanks to Bernie. Republicans are """"whistling Dixie"""" if they think they can revive """"Trumpcare"""", a complete disaster that now even Mitch McConnell doesn't support. Medicare for All will lower overall healthcare costs while expanding coverage due to its 'economies of scale'.  Employers will love it because they would no longer be involved in their employees' healthcare--a good thing for workers over 50, worried about their employer laying them off if they experience a major health problem--or if they want to change employers.

0,"If we must rehash these silly claims about the media bias in favour of Hilary, then lets go over the facts again.  It was the media and particularly mainstream media outlets such as CNN and Fox News that gave Donald Trump far more attention than any other Republican candidate. In fact, CNN gave Trump more coverage than the other 16 Republican candidates combined.  The problems that Trump had during the campaign are the same problems he is having as President and 99% of them are self-inflicted. Trump was and is an egotistical braggart with the emotional intelligence of a 5 year old who clearly does not have the temperment or judgement to be an effective President. The I always have to be right, done more than anyone else or have the biggest of everything goes to the heart of Trump's problem.  It is always about him and not the American people.

Again Trudeau is treating Canadians as patsies and chumps by letting these illegals in.

As to your question as to who is Presidential; that is a very difficult question to answer as we are not seeing a lot of good leadership. I think that you have to look at the Scandinavian countries for good leadership that benefits the citizens of those countries.  I think that Putin is dangerous and is hardly a great President. He inherited a basket case after Yeltsin and I suppose much like Africans, the older Russians are responding to his """"big man"""" style of leadership.

He's had innumerable girl friends, mistresses and victims. He described his efforts to avoid venereal disease while living a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle as his """"personal Vietnam."""" In that context, he described himself as a """"great and very brave soldier"""" -- a manifestation of his contempt for real soldiers. He's a racist and a fascist who mocks the handicapped and attacks women.

0,"Additionally, I guaranty that Trump pays no taxes. Trump would be subject to property taxes, B&O taxes, and other state and local taxes. The idea that he pays no taxes is a false one. The correct statement would be that he pays no federal taxes, which I would also highly doubt. That being said, I would bet money you would see his effective tax rate to be extremely low and well below the % of the average American.  Further, Trump is also the only one that has suggested a flat tax and doing away with the current tax loopholes and structuring that we see. This can be debated as to whether or not this would be effective as a whole, but it would certainly eliminate the tax loopholes that he using to reduce his taxable income.  This would increase his taxes and others like him. I don't see why people are trying to hold Trump to a standard they don't hold themselves to. I've yet to meet someone that pays more in taxes than they should. So stop with the double standards.

The earnings gap is a complex matter and its cause, in the Western world at least, is rarely discrimination, if at all. Family and career choices are the major causes in my view and and it's not as easy to figure out how to protest that. For a march to be successful, I think you need to target clear and concrete issues (the need for affordable daycare for example).

Some of the writers seem to be confusing the WikiLeaks e-mails with those related to State Department business (or at least Ms. Clinton's time at the State Department), which should have been on US government servers. It was, in fact, a very serious lapse in judgement (at a minimum) that Ms. Clinton chose to maintain government correspondence, which may have contained classified information, on her personal server.  Like MSW, I will hold my nose and vote for MS. Clinton. Her opponents regularly advance conspiracy theories about the Clintons that are without foundation. However, there is strong factual basis for the matters MSW raises and, with the Clintons, there has been one scandal after another.

As to ceasefires in Syria, the reason they failed in the past is because the USA, after encouraging, financing and arming the civil war for so many years, had still not given up on its hope of destroying the Syrian government. Hence the Islamist rebel groups that the USA used as proxies fought on.  The outcome of this latest ceasefire will depend on the USA's new strategy under Trump. If the plan remains to continue to destabilize Syria, then the ceasefire is unlikely to hold.

Russian servers are constantly spamming, attacking, infecting, overloading and generally causing havoc all over the internet.  It is government and private enterprise and there seems to be nothing stopping any of them.

What will happen to the matching funds when the Trump administration carries out its planned 30% cuts to HUD funding, which fund not only the low income housing tax credit program, but also the Section 8 housing voucher program? Surely the City of Seattle knows that the vast majority of new Section 8 recipients can't use their vouchers in Seattle because of the extreme shortage of landlords who will accept them. After searching in vain for 120 days for a landlord who will accept Section 8 vouchers, these vouchers expire and tenants have to renter the housing lottery. How many existing low income apartments and single family rental homes will be knocked down to build off site low income housing? Seattle has no idea, because it doesn't even attempt to track affordable units lost and gained.

0,"Mr. Hussen  says the PM’s Jan 2017 tweet “is consistent with Canada’s approach to the Haitian asylum seekers.”  However, the PM’s welcome to anyone who feels persecuted was likely intended to boost his own image globally vis-a-vis  Trump’s tough talk on illegals and his ban on migrants from certain countries in the ME.  PM’s tweet said nothing about ‘rules’ for admission.  Because of that Tweet,  thousands of ‘irregular migrants’,  unaware of ‘rules’, have given up any chance of remaining in the US, and now face the possibility of being sent directly back to Haiti, Mexico, S. America, ME or N. Africa, after spending up to 5 years in Canada’s immigration limbo.  Also,  ‘irregular migrants’  are adding to Canada’s overburdened social welfare system and lack of affordable housing.  Contrast  ‘irregular migrants’ to those admitted to Canada legally via  the merit system:  They have high demand job skills or a firm job offer, and often sufficient funds to make a downpayment on a home.

So yes, it is possible for Trump's accusations to be true. Obama lied about Obamacare to get it passed and that is recorded also. He also hid the fact he was gay, enjoyed cocaine and married a transexual. Why not do a full article on Obama and leave Trump alone.

For too long our leaders have not been there for """"we' the people"""", but for """"they, themselves"""", for their personal profit and financial growth.  That's why the Trump supporters so hate the Clintons, isn't it? They were out for themselves and would go to whatever length it took to get what they wanted?  What's so beautiful about Trump is his transparency, that his place in the Oval Office is really about his greed.  He was correct to say on the campaign trail that the US' Western democracy has devolved into a Third-World tyranny.  He just succeeded in getting the backing to put himself in the Tyrant's position.

0,"Neither Obama Care nor Trump's proposed changes come anywhere near correcting the main flaws of the US health care set-up. In this day and age, what is required is """"universal coverage"""" and a """"single payer"""".

The fact that insurance participation is largely optional just adds to the disaster.

And House republicans don't need Trump to make them look like the incompetents they are, though his presence does add to the comedy of any situation, they are more than capable of doing that themselves.  The real problem isn't conservative leaders or even the """"so-called"""" president, it's a conservative base that would elect Trump and the merry band of conservative incompetents in congress.

It doesn't take long with those rates before EVs dominate the market. We can both remember when annual sales of EVs were measured in the hundreds, the thousands, the tens of thousands and the hundreds of thousands. This year sales of EVs (not counting buses and trucks) will exceed a million for the first time. In 2019 sales of EVs in China alone will top 3.5 million. GM is now largely ignoring the US when formulating strategy , in part because of Trump and in part because GM now sells more cars in China than in the US. China and India, rightfully or wrongfully, intend to make EVs the only game in town. They may or may not reach their goals but these two large countries will be the greatest influence on car manufacturing for decades to come.

0,"Judging by the comments, a vote for Gary Johnson is either a vote for Hillary Clinton or a vote for Donald Trump.  As someone who voted for Gary Johnson in 2012, I say a vote for Gary Johnson is a vote for Gary Johnson.  I walked out of the voting booth that year feeling good.  I knew he wouldn't win, but he represented my values more closely than either of the major party candidates.  The difference between that year and this one is that in 2012 I figured the country would do OK under either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, even though I felt Johnson was a better choice.  This year, however, we are stuck between Trump, a vile racist who will demolish the country, and Clinton, a career politician who will dig us deeper into the quagmire.  I fail to see how either one as president can end well.  So this year I'm voting for Johnson because he is the only one on the ballot that can move America forward.  I invite everyone who feels disgusted by this Devil's Choice election to join me.

Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn’t, depending on where the Catholic vote goes. Trump convinced Catholic hierarchs that he was the real deal on abortion. They are easy to convince because for decades, every promise has gone unkept. The jury is out on Gorsuch, but the fact that he is reported as razzing Pence for his pro-life views shows that, yet again, the pro-life movement has been had (a question Pew did not address).

0,"Part (1)  The “state of the race” continues to devolve. At a time when Trump desperately needs to expand his voter base, he is determined to shrink it. He has consistently expressed contempt for broad swaths of the population: women; handicapped persons; racial, ethnic and religious minorities; immigrants. Yesterday he reasserted his contempt for John McCain and Paul Ryan, in particular, and Republicans in general. His criticism of McCain provides a clear view of Trump’s hypocrisy: in Trump’s view, McCain is not a hero because he was captured; Trump “would not want to be in a fox hole with him.” Of course, Trump was never in a fox hole with anyone, having taken five deferments from service during the years that McCain was languishing in a Vietnamese prison.

But we should not miss the significance of the fact that the power of the presidency is now being exercised by a surrogate who has embraced frankly racist and anti-Semitic views.

Because a Hillary Clinton Presidency and her agenda will secularization of America which means wiping out all Religious rights and Godly Christian values.

0,"First there was the silly and futile recount attempt, only in three key states Trump won by smaller (but still more than sufficient) margins. Predictably, the recount, which was based on nothing but wishful thinking,  went nowhere, and there was never any reasonable prospect of making up the difference of tens of thousands of votes per state this way. Now, all of a sudden, the focus is on the Russians. Ironically, some people who now claim to want transparency about the computer hacking, are also unhappy that e-mails from the DNC were made available to the public, showing such things as the cooperation between the Clinton campaign and the DNC against Sanders, for instance. To my knowledge, the accuracy of these e-mails was never disputed, so some Clinton supporters are presumably mad that voters learned the truth before voting. Not to mention that Clinton was never supposed to delete the e-mails in the first place. Blaming the outcome of the election on this is absurd and self-serving.

It's actually amazing that we can talk so blithely about it, and read and write about his failing and inadequacies without so much as a shrug. Correction, it's actually sad.  At least the uncertainty associated with the behavioural aspect of dealing with Trump has been resolved. Ironically, that gives us some clarity and stability, and is the reason for the blase response from other NAFTA leaders and negotiators.  Trump is really getting tiresome though. Many of his supporters couldn't endure his rambling and incoherent rants last night in Pheonix, and left early. I think everybody is just getting sick of him...even his dwindling fanatical base.

0,"A very tragic part of the documentary focussed on Trumps elder brother. At one point the brother attempted to improve the housing for tenants, housing for which he had responsibility. The father went ballistic when he found out, slaughtering his son and accusing him of needlessly wasting money.  The father sidelined him and handed over the businesses to someone who would exploit and make money from the tenants, not improve their housing - Trump! (It was then that Trump began telling African Americans that there was 'no room at the Inn' while handing the rooms to whites only.)  The lawyer representing the government at the ensuing court case was on last night's programme. She said she was absolutely shocked when Trump saddled up to her outside the court and said to her, """"Oh, come on, no one wants to live beside these people.""""  Tragically, the older brother drank himself to death. No wonder. Trumps response, """"He was a great man but he didn't have the correct genes.""""  A disgusting man!

And you'd also have to believe that former CIA chiefs and FBI directors all are deluded with fake news, too? At some point, you have got to face the fact that to admit YOU are wrong is what is keeping you from facing what is obvious to any sentient being: there were many meetings between Russian operatives (spy talk for go-betweens) and the Trump circle. Put that together with Trump's praise of Putin, a man who invaded a sovereign nation and is responsible for murdering his opponents.

0,"It seems to me that, in modern history at least, universities are places where students (typically young people) are encouraged to think and explore ideas and beliefs, even if they're controversial, without fear . The concept of academic freedom that university professors enjoy is related to that. Universities aren't simply places where students go to listen and learn quietly and show deference to elders and the status quo.  Look at the role of university students in the American civil rights movement in the 60s and 70s and in political change such as the 'Arab Spring' phenomenon. Margaret Wente is putting a label on something that has existed for a very long time and suggesting that it's somehow a threat to society that we need to be concerned about. Donald Trump was very skilled at that.

0,"diverdave,  An immigrant is simply a person who migrates from one country to another, whether according to the rules of a country or not.  """"Illegal entrant"""" is not applicable to most of the undocumented immigrants in Hawaii because they didn't cross the border without being processed.  Even you must agree that this is true. They came to Hawaii under a visa and simply overstayed, which is not a crime.  You claim they are a """"cheater"""" and a """"fraud,"""" but those are only your terms that have no legal foundation.  2/3 of the adult undocumented immigrants have been in the U.S. for 10 years or more.  They are living in our communities, though their neighbors may not know their immigration status.  Undocumented immigrants have a crime rate that is 44% below that of native-born U.S. citizens.  Trump claims to  deport the """"bad hombres,"""" but he is being indiscriminate and is deporting the """"good hombres"""" as well.  The Kona coffee farmer is a good example.

On the other side is the perceived or real  increase in safety the American people will gain from this crude attempt to keep terrorists out.  If the ban were only intended to cover refugees, then the USA is doing what every nation is entitled to do. If Trump and co intended to have the ban extended to these other groups they are crudely misguided. If the government departments implementing it  have deliberately extended it to these groups to make Trump look bad (for political gain at higher levels) is something that has not been investigated.  The courts may or may not care about  the refugees.  Either way it is political.

Not sure how it would work the other way round. Like him or not, Trump will be around for a second term and it would appear that he and O'Leary may match up fairly well. Odd fellows all around but there are a mounting number of broken promises, outright lies and arrogance to throw at Trudeau next time around.

There's been a whole lot of handwringing among certain pundits on the Left seeking to ascertain the best way to reach out to Trump voters and try to understand them, as if that would ever happen on the Right. What's to understand? They watch Fox News exclusively, buy into all the cultural resentments Fox peddles, and believe all the lies Fox feeds them. If the people who will be harmed most by the passage of the ACHA can't figure out that it was Trump and the Republicans who took their health care away because they only watch Fox and therefore believe that it was Obama or Hillary's fault, what's the point of wasting your time and energy trying to reach out to such people?

First of all they are complaining because now that minorities all have legal rights and freedoms, some immature white males think they have lost their special privileges and now only have the same rights as everyone else. Trump understands how they feel. That's why he always has to have two scoops of ice cream and a bigger piece of cake than everyone else.  Secondly, the right wing fully expects and wants the left to fold, or just sit there singing Kumbaya, holding hands and meeting for focus groups to try and understand the roots of the right wing zeitgeist and angst. They are disappointed and shocked when left wingers actually stand up and present a physical resistance. They want a free rein, and they are crying, pointing fingers and blaming others because they are not getting it.  The left might get back to singing Kumbaya when this is over, but for now it's pushing back against the Nazis, and rightfully so.

So why did the Chair of the House Intelligence Committee stand in front of the tv cameras today and announce that he had just read intelligence papers that say,  outright,  that the Obama Presidency ordered Trump surveilled,  unilaterally, downgraded the gathered information to where it was widely disseminated in order to make it easier to leak,  all before Trump was ever sworn in as President.  All of which means that what you heard from Comey, et al,  was BS,  blather,  deflection, parsing words,  and we are not anywhere near the bottom of this investigation and issue.  The Obama Presidency,  his Administration,  his name on the door labeled """"POTUS"""",  did in fact surveil,  secretly,  the communications of the Trump organization before the election and until the last day of that Presidency,  and all of the information was unilaterally downgraded in classification level to enable more risk free leaking of it to Democrat resistance organizers.

Bush's war in Iraq destabilized the Middle East, most likely for decades.

Furthermore, the author hangs the slow recovery on Obama without attribution to the Bush-authored economic meltdown that precluded it or the Republican-congress passive-aggressive foot dragging that exacerbated it.  He believes in alternative solutions to our current problems, I get that, but if he wants to have any credibility, he should at least own where most of those problems originated. It wasn't Obama or Clinton.

The equity stake, purchased at the time of the 2008 crash, and sold off (cheap) a few years later, might have provided the Canadian government a little leverage in Trump's 'Buy America' sweepstakes.  Oh well, as an alternative, maybe the current governments can buy those soon-to-be vacant GM factories back from (for a healthy, taxpayer-funded premium) to crank out electric cars so that Canadians can meet their emissions targets.  Potential spin-off benefit: new demand for Ontario's premium-priced 'green' electricity, once cars built in the US by newly re-domesticated 'Big Three' are legislated out of existence in the coming trade war, to be supplanted by eco-chic cars built by our free-trading European and Asian partners.

After mentioning the protests she noted that there were reports of people being mis-treated and harassed by TRUMP  supporters. He replied he was disappointed and that they should stop it. He then said let me look into the camera and tell them. Which he did. The point is...the two points were about the protests across the country lregarding his being elected, which he said he was sorry to hear that people were feeling afraid..etc. She then noted Trump supporters were harrassing people..to which he replied for them to stop it. Stop doing that. The point is the USA article suggests he is saying STOP IT to the protesters, which he did not, but to his own supporters for harassing otherd. I say Stop It USA your story was not true.

0,"Rod B. Catiggay.  Here's what we learned yesterday.  Trump was never under investigation, did not obstruct justice, and did not collude with Russia.  Russia didn't change the election results.  (This was somewhat disappointing to me because I was curious to know how the Russians got ahold of my mail-in ballot.)  Comey leaked his own memo, and Loretta Lynch pressured Comey to cover for Hillary. There was ample evidence to put Hillary in jail but Comey chose not to pursue it. CNN and other fake news have been lying.  The Russia story is dead, yet Democrats will continue to make themselves look foolish if not insane by pushing it.  Impeachment seems unlikely because no impeachable offense has been committed.   In fact, Obama got away with so much and set the impeachment bar so high that one can rule like a dictator, ignore the Constitution, and endanger Americans with impunity but still not be impeached.

My understanding is the GOP-aligned Deep Root Analytics firm already has such a database on nearly 200 million voters, and this database was left exposed on Amazon Web Services for nearly 2 weeks.

I suggest Dr. Momani read up on the populist and progressive movement in the U.S. of the late 19th/early 20th century. Rather than undermine liberal institutions the populist movement demanded reforms to strengthen and preserve the institutions having been corrupted by powerful industrial interests. Not unlike some current social movements that object to internationalism eroding our democratic institutions and rights. After all, the dispute resolutions built into so many of the corporate 'free' trade agreements can do just as much - if not more - damage to our institutions as the erratic actions of Donald Trump.  As for Trump, he is certainly no populist. Nor are his ideas organized enough to be called fascist. Call him a political nihilist.

Is that actually a precedent you approve of? For the record, I do not want a country operating like that, and it doesn't matter who is president.  I also don't want people being fooled into thinking such action has the same protection as a real, Congressionally passed law.

Policies that allow wage earners to keep more of the profits from their labor, again, aggregate demand, and improvement of social problems that come with poverty. 4. Continue the historic deficit reduction that happened under Obama. 5. Invest in education and infrastructure. 6. Invest in occupational retraining for workers displaced by the new economy. 7. Reduce defense spending waste. 8. Enforce environmental protections so that companies can't cost-shift the effects of their production onto the public.  Just to name a few.

With only 8 months in the job it is impossible (except for our Larry Martin of course) to predict how much The Donald will grow into the presidency and if he can get enough done by executive order and legislation starting with tax reform to enable the US economy to really take off into the 3-4% annual growth target area.  As to alienating the people whose support he needs with speeches criticizing both parties in congress, this is not as dumb as it may seem.  Trump got elected and will be re-elected if the economy is humming along at 3-4% and if his base seems him draining the Washington swamp both Democratic and Republican.  While his popularity is currently low at about 40%, congress is around 20% and GOP senate leader McConnell is running at 18% in his own state!  Trump obits are decidedly premature!

But yes, Trump may help reduce the nuclear risks and other war risks that the libbers are trying to exasperate.  Also, it is untrue that Trump has sole authority over nuclear launches.

0,"good.  someone had to do it.  The most egregious is that Trump has decided “that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels to the United States Treasury. This way it is the American people who will profit.” Trump is simply setting up a funnel for foreign government donations to the government. Since that funnel runs through his hotel, it boosts the brand value of his hotel and, thus, Trump. It doesn’t prevent diplomats from choosing to stay in his hotel to curry favor with him. It will still flatter him, because he flatters easily. Also, we will never know if he even donates the money, because he doesn’t provide proper accounting documentation for anything, and it’s not clear how “foreign government payments” would be separately accounted for anyway

However, as no such threat exists, I'd say the American thing to do when it comes to religion is """"live and let live."""" Not all Islamic societies enforce Sharia or similar values, though Saudi Arabia, Trump's current friend, unfortunately does. More important, one can find similar teachings  in the Old Testament used by Christians or the similar Tanakh used by Jews.  Some horrific stuff-- stoning of adulterers, wayward sons and non-believers; God's command to trick another tribe's men into circumcision so they could slaughter them, etc.... But such  fundamentalist abominations are not  practiced by most America's Jews and Christians, just as with most America's Muslims today.

0,"Utter nonsense. The president sets the tone for the nations's political discourse. It's always been that way. You can't ignore how he does what he does.  Take Trump's handling of the transgenders in the military thing last week. If he had just had the Pentagon make the announcement, as is customary,  it would have been a one-day story. Instead, he crassly tweeted the announcement (who announces policy by way of social media?) without first consulting his military advisers, and needlessly turned what could have been an arguably rational policy decision into a major process blunder.  That's just one in a long list of examples. Jeff Sessions. The Boy Scouts. The Priebus/Scaramucci feud. None of these things had to happen and they are all symptomatic of a president who doesn't understand the importance of temperance and nuance in politics.  As long as Trump insists on making himself the story, this is how it's going to be. And that isn't the fault of the press. It's squarely on him.

Now, hundreds of thousands of Americans are marching in Washington, DC against U.S. president Trump and his ideas but that won't get rid of Trump.

But that would explain why she'd delete 33000 emails--they would have shown her extensive ties to Russia.  That would explain why her aides destroyed their hard drives with hammers.  That would also explain the Uranium One deal.  It would explain why Loretta Lynch met with Bill on the tarmac and why it appears she may have purposefully sabotaged that investigation so it went nowhere.  Lastly, John Podesta, too, has numerous ties to Russia.  This would also explain why the DNC server, at the heart of the whole investigation, won't be turned over by the Democrats to the FBI for forensic analysis. If I'm right, that would make the Democrats, including Obama, Hillary, and anyone connected to the creation of the fake """"Trump/Russia"""" narrative guilty of sedition and treason.

Krauthammer first tries to blame Trump's abysmal inaugural ratings on Democrats pointing out Trump's negatives, along with election interference from Russia and from our own (Republican) FBI director. But Trump, in the general election, earned a paltry 42% of the popular vote, less even than a plurality. So he never was very popular, and that's HIS fault for being a bizarre, bigotry-inspiring demagogue with large character flaws.  Before pivoting to take a parting shot at the man he loathes, our current president (whose popularity rating is exceptionally high), Krauthammer takes a couple of feeble swings at Trump's outlandish and unnecessary goofiness with his twitter account leading up to the inauguration. Certainly, many of those 3 AM tweetstorms gave pause to thoughtful people. I'm certain there is much more of the same to come, unless Trump's aides take away the president's iPhone.

Aside from being contradictory, let's  not forget that it was the Republicans in Congress refused Obama's request to authorize a strike.  Then there's the whole Trump sending a message about Russia. No.  Until Trump actually does something substantial directly to Russia -  like unambiguously condemning him for directly contributing to the loss of Syrian lives - and imposing serious sanctions for it, any such message is a total fail.

But as time goes by people are realizing that what he says isn’t what he wants (or he doesn’t care about outcomes, only signing something, anything). Better, cheaper healthcare turned into a highly unpopular plan. Lower taxes? If you’re a corporation or rich. There are still people, some ‘low information’ some willing to blame others, but over time more and more people will understand: It’s just marketing, and they don’t like the product.

It seems to me that the mainstream media is being rather slow to identify the disaster of Trump's intervention in the ME; and now also the disaster of his interaction with America's European allies.  Is it not obvious that the state most responsible for ISIS is Saudi Arabia? The religious foundation of ISIS ideology of terror is Wahhabism, a version of Islam that was once isolated to SA. We are often told to follow the money. Western petro dollars are the ultimate source of the billions SA is  spending to export Wahhbabism--it is building mosque everywhere, and supplying Saudi trained imams. ISIS actually uses Saudi textbooks to teach Islam on its territory. While Wahhabism itself may not preach terror, it is apparently a short step from that particular fundamentalism to cherry picking the Quran for verses in support of militant jihadims.  And then there is Iran. Whatever issues the West may have with Iran, the fact is they are 100% engaged in fighting ISIS.

0,"The genius of President Trump is on display again as he is using his position to destroy the fake, elitist and indoctrinated news in our mist and there is nothing they can do about it. Just like using a laser pointer to annoy a cat, President Trump is able to turn on the pointer, totally control the liberal news cycle, place the pointer at a wall and watch the fake news run at the wall at breakneck speed in an effort to point out that he has went to far. When the fake news runs into the wall they find out that the pointer has moved on they are left groping in the dark with the gnashing of teeth. It's about time.  For years Bill Maher, Colbert and their liberal news has been the bully in the play yard, pushing conservatives into the mud and selling their lunch money, destroying who they do not like running them into the poorhouse.  President Trump is the president. He will be there for the next eight years and he will have the House and the Senate majorities to help him.  meow

I doubt that most conservatives hold the same values as Trump; I'm not sure he has any at all, except to make sure he and his family, and 'his kind of people', get all the wealth and attention they think they need.  Probably he and his family aren't 'evil doers' in the conventional way, just very self-centered, with no knowledge beyond their own lives.   That said, it's hard to understand why conservatives are so okay with losing social programs and needed departments so the wealthy can have another tax break.

The former Democrat turned Republican he seems to pick and choose his polices from both side of the political spectrum.  His proposed cuts in taxes and regulations are pure Republican while his opposition to trade deals comes from the left. Bernie Sanders campaigned on the same thing and union leaders in Canada have often griped about NAFTA. Trump even proposes infrastructure spending like our beloved PM.  People have asked about how Trudeau will get along with Trump. I am asking the same question of the leading conservative candidate O'Leary a staunchly pro-immigration, pro-free trade candidate. Will Trump ban O'Leary from the US as he is half Lebanese?

"
0,"I don't agree.  As has been pointed out repeatedly, the Democrats have won the popular vote in every presidential election for the past 24 years except for 2004 -- and that one was very close.  Clinton will end up with about 2.5 million more votes than Trump.  Trump won because of the way the electoral college works, but the Democrats are still the ascendant party in presidential elections -- which is why we'll start to hear increasing demands for abolition of the EC.  That will never happen, however, or at least not for a long time, because it would require a constitutional amendment, and constitutional amendments have to be ratified by the state legislatures, which are overwhelmingly Republican -- not because of any natural advantage, but because of a conscious Republican strategy of gerrymandering over the past 25 years.
"
0,"I don't buy your argument that Trump must take in more immigrants to adopt a Canadian like merit system. The US, unlike Canada, has a huge illegal immigration problem largely due to geography. When you add these folks to the number of legal immigrants you will see figures closer to ours.  Don't get me wrong. I think Mr Trump and particularly Mr Miller don't understand the complexities and will certainly screw up the implementation.  If I had Trump's ear I would encourage him to implement a fair, merit based system for a larger number of immigrants to encourage everyone to come in the front door. Family reunification and support would go a long way to help new immigrants.

0,"America is taking a course where they no longer wish to be the safe haven and protector of allies at their expense.  The costs of doing that has contributed to unmanageable debt. As the US and their dollar becomes seen as less of a safe haven it will decline in value and this will result in more exports and more jobs in the US. Job creation will be fostered by the repatriation of $trillions of offshore USD by means of tax incentives. Those countries from where these USD have taken flight will need to raise interest rates to attract capital.  This will also give the US and the USD an advantage in world trade - all without the need to become entangled in TPP and other agreements.  Trump is definitely on the right track, and Canadians can benefit greatly by aligning ourselves with the US initiatives. On the other hand, if the globalist lefties running Trudeau and his government continue down their path Canadians will suffer as much or more than others affected by these changing dynamics.

(I refer to his advocacy for his business interests in telephone calls he received in the context of his election.) He's in the process of forming the most blatantly corrupt administration in the history of the United States. His ignorance of and contempt for the Constitution are obvious.  He will be impeachable from Day 1 -- but I doubt that he'll be impeached.  The process requires integrity in the Congress, especially in the members of the president's own party. It was the integrity of the Republicans in Congress that brought Nixon down.  I don't see anything remotely close to that courage or integrity in this Republican Congress. However, I wouldn't be surprised if Trump quits at about the halfway mark. He's massively unqualified for the job and he's going to be bored. He'll suck what he can from it and walk away. Pence would finish Trump's term and be eligible to run for two of his own.

Trump supporters as a whole are angry white people looking to blame the government for their failures in life.

0,"Capitalism succeeds despite itself.  Given its own devices, it would be an inescapable authoritarianism - and in some places it is.  While it is better than feudalism, it is not as good as a more democratic cooperative socialism.  It is an interim step saved only by the free market (which is not the same thing) so that some workers can move up by quitting and because a consumer surplus placates workers who would otherwise be slaves.  Tobin is a blessing for Newark and an implied curse on those bishops who would embrace Trumpism (who will never get their red hats).  The problem with the pro-life movement is not the need for justice for the unborn or the sincerity of the followers, but of the cravenness of the leaders who have launched onto a solution that will never work, keeping them in jobs.  Nebraska has many faith filled people.  Their hearts are in the right place - if only they could see some percentage in an economics that were a bit more socialistic.

The situation here is Trump is a toddler here who hasn't stuck his finger into the flame yet even though he has been warned.  The point here is the Chinese are fully aware that Taiwan was to be returned to China via the Treaty of San Francisco process. However, that process was a sham to buttressed US military interests.  China has been resolute about Taiwan coming back. Mao and Chiang were partners and buddies at one time in the same ideological organisation. They had a falling out. A civil war within the organisation ensued. Mao won. Chiang lost. Mao's successors want what is rightfully theirs.  This is a position unlike Obama's red line in the sand. The Chinese have been crystal clear on this position since the early 1950's when the US sham the treaty process regarding Taiwan's return.

Not a darn thing,    Neither man gets to hide behind a fake name and each will recieve thousands of death threats before their term ends.  I have no problems with America's president being a world leader.   Let me correct that, I think it's critical for an American president to be a world leader.   That means showing respect and consideration to other nations and not arrogantly asking them to come calling at an American throne.  Trump is going to take some serious security when he travels abroad.    I doubt any nation will be jumping up and down to invite him over for dinner, it's going to cost them a pretty penny.

However, the insufferable tendencies of the anti-American left in Canada are back with a vengeance, and the new president of the U.S. is in their irrational minds  to blame.  Many are even inviting a wave of anti-Trump Americans and illegal immigrants to come to Canada .

0,"The """"movement"""" Kaepernick began had all but fizzled out until Trump made his pronouncement.  The reaction is not a revival of the """"movement""""; it is an anti-Trump protest, pure and simple.  Don't take my word for it...Cathal Kelly said the same thing.  One can understand how Trump's provocative ways can trigger such visceral reactions by his critics.  But it is an inauthentic argument to equate anti-Trump sentiment as genuine and active support for anything/everything Trump criticized.  The issue here is no longer """"the knee"""" or racism; it's about the expression of anti-Trump sentiments.  That's fine, but call it for what it is, please.

0,"You are TOTALLY missing the rationale behind the Russian contact with the Trump campaign.  Firstly, Putin is neither Dem or GOP/TP. He is ONLY interested in returning Russia to its former glory days. You might say Putin's motto is ' Return Russia to its old Glory Days'. And, ANYONE, who-in their view- can wittingly or unwittingly held them towards that goal they are willing to deal with such a person. So, whilst Putin would have known Trump's affinity towards Russia as an old KGB spy (and don't you forget that) he would be sending out feelers  testing the proverbial waters in order to determine how far Trump would be likely go towards meeting his Putin's) goal. In such a scenario Sessions would have been identified as one of the closest (and at that point in the campaign) Trump's foreign policy adviser. Hence the contact with Sessions. I hope I have shed some light on your concern. Feel free to respond.

The status seeking alphas use conflict to drive the process. Mcluhan saw conflict as a quest for identity, self esteem, status, ... instead of equal opportunity for all members of the human family.

0,"If the author is correct in his assessment Taiwan should not rejoice yet on this apparent improvement of its status. Trump could in the end throw it under the bus as part of a deal with China.  Trump has begun negotiations with China by playing rough. He will continue this line of action until he gets what he wants which I assume is a redress of trade with China. Currently the US runs an annual deficit of as much as $240 billion with China. To achieve his jobs creation policy Trump must significantly reduce it. Shifting that much trade activity will be a wrenching change for China since it runs a deficit with much of the rest of the world. It will obviously resist and must be pushed off its position.  However, Trump is smart enough to know that he cannot get his way on everything and must give on a few things to get what he wants. Taiwan will be bargaining chip.  Taiwan should not rejoice yet. Trump could give it to China in exchange for jobs in America.

0,"I beg to differ on this.  Although the subject is touchy and the headline is basically correct, the press asked the question and they're used to Republicans being silent and trying to be diplomatic about it.  However, diplomacy and silence are not traits associated with Donald Trump so, rather than allow them to put out fake news about phone calls to survivors of our fallen military people, he told them what he did and then put out a fact that they wouldn't report on.  I'm sure General Kelly has told him he wasn't called by the President, when his son died, which probably upset President Trump a lot, so he brought it up.  I'm sure President Obama was NEVER asked a question like this, but the morally bankrupt media will lower the standards to do most anything to President Trump.  Liberals get their panties in a wad and you never know what they'll do.  However, I can assure them, if they do things to President Trump, they may not get the desired result.

Contrast this to POTUS immediate and inflammatory tweets after the London attacks.  2.

If they are victims, they are victims of their choices and or the people that raised them. Having spent 40 years in a career in human services in Oregon, I've seen a lot of this behavior first hand. 90% of my clients were white. If they treated each other better, they may learn to treat the rest of us better too. My first message to my clients was always, """"take responsibility for your lives"""". If you don't, someone else will. See Trump. There are no minorities forcing them to do anything in Oregon and the vast majority of the rest of the country.

Give Trump all of our state's detailed voter rolls and personal records?  What could possibly go wrong?  But register our guns?  No way!  (sarcasm)

1,"Look another republican living in the past.  The present must be really rough.  To be clear the report says that Trump paid prostitutes to pee on the bed Obama slept it to ruin it, not that he was peed on.  He's much more of a garden variety peeping tom, opening doors he shouldn't and trying to catch women and teenagers unsuspectingly and undressed, if that doesn't work he can always grab em by the pussy.

1,"Nobody should be surprised by the criticism of Trump over the pardon. The media, Democrats, McCain't, Flake, Ryan and other are establishment first and always. They will criticize Trump for the way he brushes his teeth or wipes his arse.

0,"""""I don't think people are scandalized by the pope. I think they're being told to be scandalized. I think there's a difference,"""" Cupich said Nov. 6 at a public conversation with Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne at the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics.  The Republican bishops and the rightwing blogosphere have orchestrated attacks on our pope.  When their hero Donald Trump was humiliated by Pope Francis in Rome, they accelerated their attacks.

"
0,"Well, Doc, that was me, so no need to be coy. To simplify it for you, Trump focuses on incidents of terrorism that reinforce his and his base's racism and prejudices while ignoring those committed by individuals or groups that he and his base identify with, even if the latter kill more Americans.  But who knows, perhaps there were """"some very fine people"""" to be found among the ranks of those mass murders, to use the trumpian phrase.
"
0,"""""Trump's approval ratings in the US, btw, are the lowest of any president at inauguration in recent memory. """"  Considering he hasn't done anything as president yet, an approval rating is kinda moot.  But with the amount of people claiming he had already ruined the country within days of the election results, it is not surprising.

0,"Poor Justin. May have to revisit his silly  tax increases on top earners.  What surprised me about the Trump proposed tax cut on corporations is that it may include removing the deduction for interest expense The industries hurt the most by this are private equty and real estate.
"
1,"I'm well acquainted with the situation thanks. I'm also well aware that Trump's aggressive threats are exacerbating the situation. His bullying has only led to North Korea ramping up its threats. We badly need an adult in the room, and it sure isn't Trump.
"
1,"Your American so-called """"democracy"""" thing is a ridiculous farce that was so easy to legally manipulate by Russia. Trump is a legal loser, elected by legal losers, using a losing legal system designed by legal racists.

0,"That's really a polemic statement.  Canada really doesn't have much leverage. It doesn't matter who is in that position. You can put """"Trump's twin brother"""" in there. He will still lose.  The answer to our poor position lies in the views expressed by the majority of posters on this thread and others. The context behind the comment is insipid and bereft of depth substance. They are full of emotional, gut, short term thought lines. Very few posters pen thoughtful, cogent, insightful prose.  Our system of governance and the cultural attitudes that support it demands government react to emotional hot button issues to placate the masses.  Let's face the facts. Culturally, governance wise, Canada and its people do not have long term strategic thinking in our veins. Pragmatism is and never will be a strong suit of our national makeup.  Unless this country and its populace have an epiphany and change its mindset, we are forever stuck posterior wise on another party's agenda.
"
0,"I agree with Trump's team being an alt-right coup, particularly with the collapse of the Democratic party and the capitulation of most Republicans, terrified of defiing Trump due to either the direct wrath of Trump or backlash of those that voted them into office. The so-called separation and checks and balances of the US federal government have clearly completely collapsed. Perhaps it is time for Seven Days in May.
"
1,"His Secretary of State has called him a moron.  Mental Health experts have looked at his behavior and agreed that he is a narcissistic egotist unqualified to be POTUS. Even many Republicans agree with that. Trump contradicts himself from day to day about important policy matters. He is a reality show star,  skilled at fooling a certain segment of the public into thinking he is a great man, and playing on the resentment of uneducated people against those who are well educated.

The Taliban offered to surrender their honoured guest, bin Laden, to the US if the US would share evidence he was responsible and the 9/11 attacks were planned from Afghanistan.  The response form the US was to begin immediate bombing. Wonder why.  After 16 years, untold numbers of combatants and civilians killed by US & allied  bombs and soldiers, billions spent by all NATO nations - the US has had its revenge and should now sit down and be quiet.  Trump's offering more of the same failed policy.

0,"I am an Alaskan. I will decide my vote when I arrive at the ballot box. You have no right to know who I will vote for...but I can tell you it will not be for Trump. I am looking for someone who can recreate the power of the middle class. I am looking for someone who can diminish the power of the elite. Obviously that is not Trump so I won't vote for him. The earning power and the buying power of the middle class and the size of the middle class are being systematically destroyed by the rich and powerful in this country. Time to stand up against all of those who intend to increase the power of corporations and the rich. Time to stand up against taking money from the middle class and handing it to rich people.  I know that my vote will not count in the electoral college so I will vote for someone that will take actions likely to overturn Citizens United, take the warnings of Dwight D. Eisenhower seriously, and limit the influence of the rich in elections & law.

0,"Without getting into the differences of parliamentary vs. presidential democracies, I think it's fair to say U.S.. democrats are happy with the electoral voting except for this time. They certainly thought the Hillary machine would prevail. They were rough on Bernie alright, it's just not fair in this electronic world not to have quietly succeeded. So, Trudeau scraps past the post because of Trumpism.... What else do we have here? Bush, crumbling institutions, white supremacists, and a little chick coming up here and explaining to scholars what Canadians will do. Globe and Mail. do you realize that everything from your half baked political endorsements to conducted polls and choice of opinion pieces reflects on your integrity? Do you??

0,"Yeah right!  Jeff Sessions said at his AG confirmation hearing, """" I did not have communications with the Russians,"""" but in fact he did:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-spoke-twice-with-russian-ambassador-during-trumps-presidential-campaign-justice-officials-say/2017/03/01/77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.84dd0b80b8d5  That is lying under oath, otherwise known as perjury.  If some Dems aren't calling for Sessions to be charged with perjury, it's probably because they want to see this story continue to be in the headlines to the detriment of the Trump admin.

0,"The US's current xenophobia will go away with the passage of time but while it exists Canada is wise to take advantage of welcoming those who are negatively impacted by the hysteria.   Bannon's ban and preoccupation with those who are different has now taken hold of The Donald who is now under the spell of of racist polemics.  Bannon is unquestionably smarter than Trump and will undoubtedly steer the ship right onto the rocks.  Trump's starving ego makes him an easy target for those who are willing to stroke him the right way, in this case the far right way.  Whatever the case, Canada has much to gain by being there to catch those who are neither respected nor respected for what they can bring to a country.
"
0,"Again, nobody is claiming Trump's win was historical.   And its not absurd to claim a landslide is a landslide. It's basic math -- 304 to 227 is a landslide, no matter what happened in 1892 or 2008.  Bringing up past elections results is meaningless. Yes Obama won with bigger margins but there were fewer voters and there were no Super-PACs until the 2012 election.  And the 2012 election was marked by low Republican voter turnout. Again, all the """"data wizards"""" based their election forecasts on the 2012 election turnout which is why all their forecasts of a Clinton victory were wrong.  I think we can both agree that Trump had the biggest win by a Republican in the modern electoral era (i.e., since Super-PACs were allowed in 2010).
