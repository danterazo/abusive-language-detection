0,"The DC Circuit has a higher rate of reversal and even the 7th Circuit, which has the lowest rate of reversal, has around 55% of its decisions reversed according to American Bar Assn. statistics.  This decision of the 9th Circuit has nothing to do with """"resistance"""" to Trump, but rather application of the law.  Although I am a (retired) member of the NY bar, I do not consider myself qualified to predict how the Supreme Court will handle this (if they take the case) and your certainty would lead me to guess that you have no expertise in this area.

0,"Or he could watch the news and rely on the governor's knowledge. Obama, Trump, Bush, none of them are experts in disaster management. Hillary is because she's been married to Bill for so long. (Sorry, I couldn't help it) Obama was asked to skip the trip and he did. I hope that the money he didn't spend flying to Louisiana went instead to the flood victims.

0,"ESPN said “We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate.” Some critics might say that was a slap on the wrist; I say it was a handshake from ESPN’s far-left anti-Trump leadership.

0,"They are people, they just aren't acting humanely or ethically and don't appear to like democracy.  Violently attacking people you just lost to in an election is an affront to democracy the world over.  The left wing hate is visceral and quite frankly, frightening.  I've seen a multitude of social media videos of left wing fascist groups violently attacking people on the right side of the political spectrum.  It happened in Ottawa over the weekend.  Black clad antifa terrorists were arrested and disarmed by the police for beating people.  Five people were arrested and four charged with numerous offences including assault causing bodily harm, assault with a weapon, robbery and uttering death threats, said Ottawa police Const. Marc Soucy. The altercation took place at about 11:30 a.m. - NP  They are people Eric Trump, they are just very hateful and intolerant people, like the brownshirts of the day were.

The reason it is the theme of the convention is because he is the Republican party's nominee for president.

0,"Yes, bombastic caudillos always proclaim they are speaking for the majority.  (Note, however, Trump's approval is at 30 - 35%). . The point of having freedom of speech and freedom of conscience is to protect the ability of people to make choices based on reason even when, or perhaps especially when, their views do not have the support of the majority. . Some of us are old enough to remember the Vietnam war, when exactly the same things were said about public protest. . The protestors turned out to have been correct. . Some of us are old enough to remember Richard Nixon claiming to speak for """"the silent majority"""".  The Republicans then claimed that Watergate was a big fuss over nothing.  Nixon proclaimed that he was not a crook. . The protestors turned out to have been correct. . But your response is to deny people basic rights in a democracy. . The most important time to protect civil rights is when it is least popular to do so.

0,"Regarding your question, the answer is no.  About so many US citizens commenting on Trump related articles, my take is this: they are not necessarily all US citizens.  Some are Canadians who now call US home but still read Canadian newspaper, like myself.  Some are Canadians who in spirit is Trump's base who wish there is a candidate like him here in Canada (why Rob Ford won in Toronto said something).  Some are Canadians who dislike Trump so much that they must comment, that's what a controversial figure usually provokes.   Some are Canadians who like Trump so much that they must jump to his defense no matter what he does (like his American base).  Some are such die-hard Trump's fans, they sound almost like a paid troll (not saying they are, don't call me uncivil here).  So the short answer is, not many US citizens liked commenting in a Canadian paper.

Are we supposed to not be in a state of disbelief that so many people, men and women, could overlook that history of racism, sexism, bigotry and misogyny and ask how that could be true when that is not the way we raise our kids? When I suggest that latent racism was aroused by trumps rallies and contributed to his victory is that really """"uncivil"""". Is it """"uncivil"""" for my fellow Americans to forget what they have seen the man say and do and vote for him because of that boorish aggressiveness rather than in spite of it?

Funny how Trump got voted in on a platform of non-intervention and is now almost reaching Hillary Clinton level war rhetoric. A decorated West Point teaching general just appeared on MSNBC with Rachel Maddow (another imperialistic Rhodes Scholar - surprise, surprise) and said that they will be """"releasing"""" mineral wealth (democracy and freedom for resources).

You can ask me anything you want.” Reporter: “Will you answer?” McConnell: “Christ, no, you think I’m an idiot?”  []  Republicans are hiding the ball here for obvious reasons. Good ideas don’t need to be hidden from the public. Bills that are opposed by majorities in all 50 states do.

1,"And it is stupid how right wingers constantly throw out the L word as if. I am a proud liberal leaning person with views, like most, that straddle moderate. Liberals tend to be more educated, are healthier, make more money, pay more taxes and inform our votes.  Blue states pay more into the Federal government than they receive while red states like Kentucky take take take and then complain about taxes. Republicans like you want government out of their lives!    Because you don't want your streets snow plowed or police to arrive when you call or libraries or safe and organized society.  Do you want anarchy?  Just love too how those red states, like North Dakota and Oklahoma, gladly receive disaster aid from the federal government  while trying to deny health care to citizens.  The tRump supporters and the current GOP is filled to the brim with hypocrisy.  Government is us.  Government is good.  It should be analyzed and trimmed with a scalpel, not randomly butchered with a chainsaw.

0,"There clearly are very divergent views about Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords. I cannot understand why our President won't openly and directly let Americans know what he believes or doesn't believe about global climate change. Don't all of us need and in fact deserve to know from him what his position is on the subject? After all, his policy positions will flow directly from his views about climate change. Why does the Administration refuse to answer what the President thinks about the matter?  The EPA Chief and Spicer today ignored this very fair and fundamental question. It was all deflect, evade and assert that the Accords are a """"bad deal"""" for our country. Ok, I'll run with that assertion. Maybe a """"better deal"""" is possible. But the President's views on climate change will frame his policies going forward. Mr. President, why won't you let us to know what your views are. It's simple:  do you believe that climate change is real or a hoax?

"
0,"The sad reality is Trump may not be able recall what he told Comey. At 70, Trump is the oldest president ever elected. His father had Alzheimer's. It is heritable. The blogger  Neurocritic has laid out what he sees as proof of Trump’s mental deterioration. He is unable to complete a full sentence. He relies on words likes """"things,"""" """"very"""", """"tremendous"""" to  fill in mental gaps.  Last month, in a TV interview, he forgot what country he had bombed, days before. The Daily Beast transcribed one sentence Trump delivered at a campaign stop in South Carolina: """"Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart—you know, if you're a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world ...""""

"
1,"Trump won because a shocking number of voters are dumb as a bag of hammers. As long as such mealy-mouthed silly rationalizations are tolerated, the country will probably do similarly stupid things all over again.
"
0,"Federal law clearly gives the President exclusive authority to restrict immigration from any country if he deems it necessary. That's why the SC reinstated Trump's EO, that's also why they will eventually rule in his favor. No one can deny there's an inherent risk of a terrorist falling through the cracks if the government continues to allow 100,000+ Muslims to immigrate each year from countries that hate America. Saudi Arabia, Pakistani, UAE, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan should be added to the list.
"
0,"Here's a pattern that will only disrupt international diplomacy.  When Trump and foreign leaders meet (and in the joint statements that customarily follow such meeting), the President usually is on his best behavior with differences underplayed and resolution anticipated without much stress and strain.  Similarly, when other US Administration officials and representatives meet with foreign counterparts, similar reasonableness and prospect for conciliation are stressed.  Interspersed with such official and quasi-official communications, however, are the midnight tweets like the ones referred to in this article or relating to the purported, but vehemently denied, involvement spying on Trump for Obama by UK intelligence agencies.  This 'good cop, bad cop'  routine seriously diminishes US credibility and, given the keystone US geopolitical role, is a very worrying destabilizing factor

I read another article recently about """"how much of a horrible job trump is already doing on the job"""" HELLO ! He has not even been sworn in yet & is not officially """"on the job"""" yet.  I read this whole article, and while Professor Porter is laying out his views of the lord of the rings, I am just sitting here reading thinking.. """"they still don't get it.""""  People are so shell shocked that they did not get their way with all of the scamming that Hillary did to try to win.

"
0,"I see in the Sunday R-G that there is a backlog of 124 Federal Judges that Trump will get to appoint during his first four years.  Including 19 Appellate Court Judges.   Since the Democrats changed the rules while they were in power so it only takes 51 votes to confirm any Federal Judge except to the Supreme Court, he will get the ones he wants.  (See Page A3 of the R-G)  They are predicting another 70-90 other Federal judicial vacancies during his four years, too.  That will let him change 1/3 to 1/2 of all the Appellate Judges in the United States Court system.   No need to 'Abolish that Branch', now is there?  The Judicial Branch of the government won't be 'destroyed'; just modified under its customary legal procedures!
"
1,"Sexual assault is not a resurrection of 'Victorian values'. It's a criminal offense in a modern society. As it should be.  It certainly is ironic that the same crowd that flipped out about transgender people in the 'wrong' bathrooms groping women now supports a candidate who openly boast about groping women. Hypocrisy at its best!  I can't recall any mainstream voices from the left claiming that 'pedophilia is normal'. Maybe you can enlighten us with some actual sources and facts, instead of spouting right-wing hyperbole.  Lastly, it's irrelevant whether Trump was a Democrat or a Republican when these offenses occurred. If he committed a crime he's guilty.

Whilst Trump's actions may not suit Canada and Canadians he is not our leader and what he does and doesn't do really is none of our business. The G&M would be far better served by investigating and reporting the ever increasing and questionable behaviour of our own politicians of every party. Every newly elected President will usually, on coming into office, replace almost all the political appointees of all the government agencies put in place by a predecessor of the 'other' party. Those administrators in the current US government were all appointed by Obama.  I don't recall such media coverage when Obama was sacking Republican appointees wholesale, 8 years ago? If Trump does turn out to be the disaster the G & M claims they should be making sure our own government are ready to meet that 'disaster' when it comes.

0,"Trump is a CEO not an inspirational speaker.  He's running the country; he's not an ideological spokesperson.  This country has made the mistake, most notably with Carter and Obama, believing that people who are smart and talk nice are good leaders.  The best leaders are those who take action instead of talk; who make decisions instead of endlessly trying to find compromise.  It's the definition of leading:  stay out in front while others follow behind you.  Jefferson, Lincoln, and FDR were great leaders for their acts, not their rhetoric.  They made hard decisions even if it pissed some people off.

0,"Trump provoked NK when he bluffed with his """"Armada"""" statements in April. Right after that, NK ramped up its tests and rhetoric. Trump was acting like a kid with a new Christmas toy.  The problem is that the """"toy"""" was a figurative video game controller over US military capabilities. Basically, Trump taunted NK in a way that US Presidents previously had assiduously avoided, playing with his new toy.  It appealed to his deepest, darkest bully. The result is where we are today. Note this:  NK doesn't have nuclear capabilities without the assent of China.  It simply does not happen.  China could affect regime change in NK anytime it wants.  The spigot of China/NK trade could just be turned off and made purely black market. Jong Un led NK, nuclear NK, anti-US NK is good for China.  It creates an important border buffer. Trump picking a fight with NK in a way that compels NK to do something, anything (which Trump has already said would bring fire and fury), is unnecessary and dangerous.

0,"Trump """"MAY"""" be held to account. He possibly """"MAY NOT"""" be held accountable.  I suspect the greater likelihood is he will not be held accountable. The expectations of him are too low.

0,"The whole spectrum of the Republican party - from right wing nut jobs to main stream conservatives - has been singing the """"Repeal and Replace"""" mantra for seven years. They've layered on the promises that they would do in on Day One, that they would do it simultaneously and seamlessly (no gap between repeal and replace), that they would insure every one, that they would do it for for less money and provide better care. They lied. For seven years, they lied. They could have been working with President Obama and the Democrats to improve the Affordable Care Act, but they did everything in their power to undermine it. Still, after a rocky start and despite the best efforts of the obstructionists, the ACA has extended health insurance to millions of people who didn't have it and improved the health and well-being of millions more. The roll-out of the farcical health care act yesterday, and the reaction to it, demonstrates the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of Trump and the GOP

0,"Trump and Ross make a nasty pair to deal with. I recall reading one business executive who said Trump's modus operandi was to walk into board meetings and throw a hand grenade. He then liked to comeback a few weeks later and deal with directors, as they recuperated from shell shock. The billionaire Ross is of similar ilk: A specialist in corporate turnarounds, Ross buys distressed or bankrupt companies at steep discounts, then seeks to shave costs and generate profits. Some of those cost reductions come from altering pay and benefits for workers.

The 1% did quite well starting with TARP (whether you give the credit for that to Bush or Obama) and ending with today's stock market during the Obama administration.  The 'left behind voters' who voted for Trump (against Obama-Hillary?) are categorized that way based on economics.  They, at least, answered Reagan's question """"Are you better off today than you were [eight] years ago?"""" in the negative and voted Trump.  Those who love the racist, homophobic, misogynistic view of the world won't even acknowledge that possibility, of course.

0,"The first thing people need to realize is that Trump's tax plan doesn't add up, given his other initiatives.     In fact, it points to a huge increase in their deficit and a huge increase in debt.    Combine that with Trump's protectionist rhetoric.     It sounds really great to bring back jobs to the U.S., but with that comes higher costs which WILL be passed on to the consumers.   Then there's healthcare costs.  The second thing people need to know is what's involved in moving to the U.S. and what the long-term implications are from a tax perspective.    I've worked in the U.S. so know a little bit about it.    As a green-card holder, you can work for up to 7 years.     After that, you will be subject to the U.S. Exit taxes which are prohibitively high.     The only way to avoid that is to move back before, or take out U.S. citizenship.     U.S. citizenship means that you will have universal taxation as long as you remain a citizen, be subject to US Estate taxes, etc

To say Junias was prominent among the apostles means just that!  Paul is commending her work as someone who saw the risen Lord and was an evangelist.  The scholarship and testimony of Origen, Chrysostom, and Jerome trumps your fear of acknowledging the important roles play by women in the early Church.  Can you name one other person in Scripture who is said to be ‘among the apostles,’ but who did not have an experience of the risen Lord and did not engage in missionary work?

However, Trump actively frightens me, and I loathe what he stands for as well. I can see Trump getting into a war through ignorance and personal pique. I do not see Clinton doing that.  Most of all, Trump actually repudiates Christianity. He embraces racism. He sees women as sex objects -- he said that one of the women who accused him of groping was """"too ugly"""" for him to consider doing that. This is apparently a serious response to the accusation. He does not stand for any sort of moral values.  I question the values of the so-called Christian leaders who support Trump. They are actually hurting their own churches. After this election, in which so many Christians in the US have behaved so very badly, who would ever want to darken the door of one of their churches again?

You don't understand how 10,000 baby boomers a day are reaching social security retirement age. Then you won't understand that the LFPR will continue to flat line or fall some more from where it is now, over the next 10 years, regardless of who is POTUS, D or R. 151 million are employed in the U.S. 94 million are not in the labor force. 72 million are under age 16 or institutionalized.

Canada is the market for about 18% of US exports and Mexico for about 11%. The benefit of these exports is concentrated in several States and industries of importance economically and politically. Such lobbying to mobilize early support will have a breaking effect on the capacity of Trump to pursue rapacious goals in a bullying manner.  US trade partners generally are, like Canada, eager to find alternative trade relationships and markets to lessen their reliance on the US.  Seriously exploring (and being seen to be exploring) greater 3rd country possibilities now while preparing to renegotiate NAFTA promises to both lessen our reliance on US trade and strengthen our hand in NAFTA negotiations.

Though we will never know for certain what was said between Putin and Trump given the omission of a stenographer and the competing accounts of Sec. of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Surgey Lavrov, one thing we can be sure of is that Tillerson put the best spin possible on Trump's performance.

Engineers have been crying for infrastructure repair for forty years, but Congress won't fund it. Trump promised better and cheaper health care for everyone, but what Congress came up with is unworkable and probably can't pass.  Dionne says that the left needs not to mock, but to empathize with the mostly white blue-collar Trump voters, and he is right.  That doesn't mean getting behind Trump's rattletrap policy, it means pointing out the shortcomings and presenting decent alternatives, Thirty years ago Trump was widely regarded as a buffoon in his home town. Now he is an alarming buffoon with tremendous power. I just hope he doesn't blow up anything important.

0,"I wonder what will remain of the two-party system when the dust settles from this debacle.  Trump continues his assault on the Republican Party, and the party in turn continues to look like a circular firing squad.  Perhaps some sort of conservative party will emerge, or maybe something along the lines of what used to be called """"Rockefeller Republicans""""; or maybe both. I especially appreciate your comment about re-establishing a requirement to study citizenship (we called it """"Civics"""" in my time and place.)  I wonder where Trump was when they taught that in his school; he came to the presidency lacking even a rudimentary understanding of government. He literally didn't know how a bill become a law, and I think he still doesn't know.

Trumpet never explains how he will """"make America great again"""" by detailing specific policies or programs. He just waves his tiny hands and loudly bloviates generalities of how only he knows the way to make a """"deal"""". """"America First"""" sounds patriotic, but it is a phony slogan which in truth means a disastrous turn to nationalism and isolationism. Our great country can't survive in isolation from the rest of the world by building silly walls.

The problem, IMO, the intellect of the Trump group , reduced to its lowest common denominator is symbolized by a nazi salute and a swastika;  this debases all levels of that group and defines the leader.  Trump, can disavow as much as he wants, he is the identity of the group. The supreme irony, of course, is that the latter was totally scammed by their chosen leader.

0,"Actually, most of the ill informed commenters tried to falsely claim LGBT was a mental illness. Right out of the Supremacist Playbook. As for Trump and LGBT support: As a candidate for president, one of Donald Trump most notable breaks from conservative orthodoxy was his on-the-record support for LGBT rights. At the Republican National Convention, Trump said he’d “do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens.” That was after Peter Thiel became the first openly gay Republican to speak at the party’s convention, and after Trump told “the LGBT community” that he’d “fight” for them. Milo Yiannopoulos, the former Breitbart editor who co-hosted a “Gays for Trump” party at the RNC, said he was “delighted” that the president had made a smart and compassionate decision. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump said in a speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that he """"will do everything"""" to protect LGBT communities from violence Did I tell you Trump lies
"
1,"Exactly. Trump is corrupt, incompetent and unstable, and it is easy to see how impeachment could become necessary.  But impeachment/conviction would give us a president who has been corrupted by his loyalty to Trump and who is a true ideologue: a right-wing extremist who has a history of opposing gay rights, immigrants, etc.; in short, a culture warrior.

Despite all this whining, complaining and hand wringing, ZERO evidence has been presented tying the Trump campaign to Russia or that Russia hacked the election, smh.  Meeting with the Russians is just awful, maybe Sessions should have given away 20% of our uranium to the Russians in return for a 2 million dollar charity contribution and another check for his wife to give a 5 million dollar speech, the democrats wouldn't care then.

I am very disappointed that Trump was elected, but I completely understand how the frustration in the electorate bounced irrationally into his corner.  Hillary was out of touch from the beginning, and many Democrats knew this in their hearts if they had listened close enough.  I saw Bill Clinton speak one time, and he is a fantastic speaker.  He presented his case for why Hillary should be chosen.

I did misspeak. however the pictures are just salacious and this maybe not the best place to display them.  trumps views on women are pretty clear to those who oppose him.  to those who support him - they apparently done't care - even the women he hates so much...+++I believe I owe you an apology for coming to the thought that you were a jerk. your last sentence after the pics were not very clear as to why they got posted.  so MY APOLOGIES TO YOU...and look forward to future conversations...

0,"we can only hope your analogy works.  The one element that Shribman omitted from his article was the violence that has has too often become a part of the anti-Trump demonstrations.  Add to that the call from various celebrities to use violence against Trump or Trump supporters,  formerly reputable news organizations like the Washington Post no longer making the effort to verify 'facts' or get more than one source for an allegation, and the lack of tolerance for those with whom one disagrees.   The mix has become scary.

So sad!  BTW, the Electoral College can be made irrelevant if states pass laws requiring electors to cast their votes for the winner of the popular vote. Given that there are already laws instructing electors on how to vote, it's not a big change.

You forget that the shoe used to be on the other foot, and J. Edgar Hoover blackmailed a long succession of US Presidents in order to keep his job. If Comey were smart, he would have built himself the same insurance policies, but he didn't, and now he's out. Trump's firing of Comey may offend leftist sensibilities, but until someone shows me he's done something illegal, he's done exactly what he promised to, to shake up Washington. Amidst all of this hand wringing ask yourself this question - how long would have Comey kept his job had Hillary been elected?

In addition Trump has another plan for Hawaii.  He is going to send thousands of refugees coming in to the U.S. un vetted to the ALOHA state.  That way they are isolated from the sane Americans who believe in keeping America safe.  If you thing that Hawaii has a problem with the homeless now wait till Trump gets done with you.

The juvenile tweets, unprovoked  fights with close allies, pathetic lies about crowd sizes to assuage his bruised ego, dismissive disgust at any who oppose him (so called Judge), all within a mere two weeks of his tenure. Republican politicians may be squirming in great discomfort as they sit on their hands watching this farce unfold, but eventually they will be forced to either choose sanity or be cowards and go along with Trump. I'm betting enough of them will grow spines to show Trump the door.

By doing so they have diminished respect for all law--for law itself. The very same institutions that have a moral obligation to uphold and/or  enforce the law have failed both illegals and the American people.  Those suffering or afraid in the above article are the responsibility of all those who have encouraged, participated in  or otherwise supported government's criminal neglect and massive failure,  to uphold and/or enforce the law, and now they blame TRUMP!!!  The Bishops should be ashamed of themselves not only as Bishops of the church who distorted Catholic Social Teaching  but as American citizens who never truly had America's best interests in mind.

Her political life has been nothing except scandal, corruption, conniving, lying, enabling her woman-chasing husband, living off taxpayers money, enriching herself off other people's money (including from other countries through the highly suspect Clinton Foundation), poor performance as Secretary of State (including protecting Americans in Benghazi), and the list goes on. Her and her party's worst offense has been against Black people who they have used and abused to get elected, then done nothing to improve their future prospects much less their current daily lives.  We have two highly flawed candidates, so I will vote for a constitutional SCOTUS, the possibility of charter schools and vouchers, individual freedom and responsibility, a strong military and national defense, and legal immigration enforced by a closed border and the rule of law.

Trump thanked Lebanese prime minister Hariri for Lebanon’s efforts in fighting extremist groups, including the political party Hezbollah.  “Hezbollah is a menace to the Lebanese state, the Lebanese people and the entire region,” Trump said.  There’s only one problem: Hezbollah is in the Lebanese government.    Hariri only became prime minister following a 29-month political stalemate in Lebanon that only ended after Michel Aoun, an ally of Hezbollah, became president.  Aoun named Hariri prime minister as part of a compromise deal of sorts, and while Hariri has an adversarial relationship with the organization, its members nonetheless have significant power within the government.  Trump.  Not one day without Trump being a national disgrace.  And in a really deranged moment, Trump wanted to take credit for 'providing healthcare' to Syrian refugees in Lebanon.  Say what?

Ultimately Rob was never mayoralty material ( obviously) but clearly he had a base and a cause. But like Trump, he was unsuitable to govern because he never really had discipline and a plan.

They were lying on every count, and everyone knew it; and they knew everyone knew it. (None of them is naive or stupid.)

0,"Who said that it wasn't accepted  when Trump said it?  The NYSE pharma index would have dropped in either case.  Charging less = less profit = lower stock prices.  The response clearly would have been the same if Obama said it.  Don't try to make some political point where there isn't one to be made.

0,"Both the left and right wing are fracturing between (a) the elitist establishment who have captured party machinery and the media, and (b) their core constituencies (voters, grassroots members).  Bigshots in the Repug party thought they could have the minion-candidate of their choice, but the constituencies nominated Trump.  Key parts of Killary's core constituency flipped and gave Trump the election.  Trump has benefitted from the same fracture on each side of the political spectrum.  The establishment is terrified that the core constituencies are waking up to see that the real struggle is not between left and right (where civilized people have been managing to get along for centuries), but between the 'Grand Insidership' and everyone else.

0,"CAE, I guess the relative stability of the US electoral process over time has, in a certain sense, """"spoiled"""" many Americans into thinking something like the election of Donald Trump couldn't happen. In Europe, by contrast, we often have untypical election outcomes and have a history of handling them accordingly. There is a conviction in Italy, for example, that the checks and balances, internal and external, will soon restore the political system to stability and that the temporary instability may actually be good for everyone, since the norm is that government doesn't get much done. Given the fact that we've been in a situation of political deadlock now for several years, it could be that we'll manage to get something worthwhile done (e.g., infrastructure spending) before the checks and balances kick in and bring us all back to reality. Berlusconi actually managed to get something done between orgies....And that's all Civil Comments will let me say on this subject. Ciao!
"
0,"There is a lot more to this story than meets the eye. Despite the large number of missiles fired, the results are minimal in terms of the conflict overall since the US warned of the attack in advance, giving time for the Russians and Syrians to move jets and equipment from harm's way. The question still remains, that no news agencies seem to be asking,  is what Assad could possibly gain from a chemical weapon attack on civilians, knowing that it would cause international retaliation and condemnation. Why would he have done it if he had nothing to gain and much to lose? Until that question is answered, I think everyone should remain skeptical. The US has lied its way to war many times. Even Marine LePen, a Trump fan, said that Trump should have waited until an investigation was completed. First time I've agreed with her.
"
1,"Joe Arpaio and David Clarke are the two most famous, sadistic law enforcement officers in the country.    They re known for their brutality and defiance of the rule of law.  Trump is rewarding both of them.   And, by the way, getting rid of Gorka and Bannon didn't rid the White House of fascists.   There are others.  And he's apparently hiring more every day.

0,"I think the antagonists should go through a more rigorous exercise before wasting more ink and angst, distilling their worries, complaints, concerns into a more addressable and calmer form of discourse.

0,"An astute post, but the media, IMO, play a significant role in forming the opinions of Hawaii voters. Ideally  the media would give equal time to both the pros and cons of any given subject, but unfortunately we see 90% against Trump rarely an article or editorial in the SA or local news supporting his policies. Even the photos of Trump are those taken with the worst possible expressions. Such a strategy has worked locally for many years to the point where the average citizen is brought up believing that a Republican is some sort of evil person. Such a one-sided approach works fine with a Democrat as President, but when the other party is in control, then legislatures from Hawaii should act as politicians and drop the vitriol against the President. It may work in Hawaii, but good luck in Washington, DC.

0,"To be successful in politics you need to build trust with the electorate . This is political capital. But if the citizens are being lied to on an ongoing basis you lose political capital with the electorate ( your ardent supporters may stick with you but that is a small percentage.)  It is one thing to tell untruths in a campaign and quite another when you are the leader of a country . So the first press briefing is a time to start the process on a positive footing. So what happened the first press briefing this weekend was  full of lies or “alternate facts”. So I hope the Trump administration has learned a good lesson from what happened this weekend.  “Trust is the glue of life. It’s the most essential ingredient in effective communication.

It's one of the many pieces of the blowback puzzle that has culminated in the nomination of Trump.  A rational, pragmatic party interested in good governance would have take Garland's nomination and run with it.  Instead they took the Trump path and doubled down on idiocy.  So yes, Clinton may have a shot at several SCOTUS justices.  Courtesy of the GOP.  I only hope that they are centrist jurors, not the flaming liberals that could be nominated in the penultimate payback opportunity.
"
0,"I agree with you, there is no point in Trump, or anyone else, going out of their way to insult Kim Jong-un. It isn't productive, and just lowers the whole exchange to 3rd-grade playground, until someone gets socked or the teacher breaks it up.  Better to use some innovative thought and come up with a third way.  Trump could actually be a hero who turned NKorea into an ally instead of a problem. Geez, he'd never shut up about it.

Oooh and I love your use of multiple exclamation points -  just like the baby-in-chief.  You can be sure I won't be taking any breaks from point out just how stupid trump MAGAphants and Fox lapdogs are.  Here's something for a moron like you to think about:  Of the 50 least educated counties in the USA, Trump won 47 of 50.  And Trump could only manage to win 2 of the most educated counties.  The greatest correlation between a vote for trump and trump voter's attributes was lack of education.  Not income, not race, not gender, not age.  So, for stupid white guys like you who love the baby-in-chief, it's time to own your racism, homophobia, and misogyny that are all tied to your lack of education and your willful stupidity. But please keep posting so I continue to have a chance to point out your stupidity.
"
0,"Yes, but building a more balanced economy is not even close to being on the table. That is true of both Trump & Trudeau & there like characters in the political world who, in different ways, sold their versions of a more balanced economy.  Both have failed to take any real steps in that direction. Unfettered Free Trade is just as much an impediment as the basic income is to a balanced economy, but it is the route Trudeau is taking. To have UFT with countries that have low wages & low everything else IS to trade away jobs, and shift income to the capital class. Result: overall growth, big winners and big losers, no balance, & an incentive to support basic income (and, admittedly, create a majority permanent lower middle underclass.  Support for the idea that a basic income is good and necessary is a sign of the loss of hope and the utter lack of imagination in the bought & paid for political class.

What do you suppose would have happened to one of those Russians (even Putin) if they spouted off that the head of FSU (Former KGB) is  """"a real nut job""""? Then who would be so stupid as to approve publishing that quote verbatim in the official account of the meeting? This is just more evidence to support the characterization of Donald J. Trump by Pulitzer award winning historian David McCullough:  """"So much that Donald Trump spouts is so vulgar and so far from the truth and mean-spirited. It is on that question of character especially that he does not measure up. He is unwise. He is plainly unprepared, unqualified and, it often seems, unhinged.

0,"During the first two weeks of Donald Trump's presidency, Trump's bigotry, incompetence, and emotional instability have been on full display for the country and the world to see. Now comes another tweet, this one to describe a federal judge -- nominated by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate 99-0 -- as """"this so-called judge."""" This is not the first federal judge for whom Trump has expressed contempt, but this is the first time he has done so as president. Trump is contemptuous of the Constitution, American values, and democratic government. The fact that this profoundly damaged man is president of the United States demeans the presidency and diminishes the country. However, Trump's presidency is far more than an embarrassment to the country; it is a clear and present threat to the peace and security of the country and of the world. Now, as much as at any time in our history, we need our constitution and our constitutional officers to function as intended by the founders.

In time, they may strike a deal, but they won't get it out of the gates as the Germans as very keen to a put the screws to them to discourage anyone else who might get similar ideas.  But they voted for it after all. Revealed preference. I guess they place more value on sticking it to immigrants than to pleasant weather and good food for half the year.  Frankly, five years from now the lessons the UK will draw from Brexit debacle (and the US from the Trump circus) will not be the ones the crypto National Socialists are hoping for - people will be shaking their heads and wondering how they could have so blithely thrown the baby out with the bath water.  In the meantime, sit back and enjoy the show.

That can still be evidence against anything he drafts.....but I suspect drafted """"properly"""" he will get a form of a ban.  His big mouth on the """"one China"""" policy also got him in hot water....he has since retrenched.  His $23 B wall is in retreat....AND he is about to set Wall Street free of Dodd-'Frank, his big mouth saying """" he was the ONLY one not beholden to Wall Street""""......finally he watched the hearing and """" i am educated, went to school, I comprehend better than ANYONE...."""" he is a fraud and worse, he is just plain dense.

0,"Confused, MSW, is the focus of this stream of consciousness Trump or Tillerson?   Do hope that Senators actually do their homework and have documentation that is comprehensive and balanced when they vet Mr. Tillerson.  Things you skipped over to fit your skewed viewpoint:  - US state department has a long and fitful history of aligning with authoritarian leaders/dictators - some for decades e.g. Saudi Arabia, Gulf states, former Russian states - US history is filled with US military interventions to influence governments - Iran, Iraq, Guatemala, Cuba, Philippines, Vietnam - we could go on  Fact - US has also supported the Kurds - so, why condemn ExxonMobil?  Russia - please investigate the actual negotiations....Tillerson did not just acquiesce to Putin; given ExxonMobil experience in Venzuela, he pushed for a pragmatic deal that did not given anything away  Fact - Tillerson as Boy Scout chair, pushed for gay rights/inclusion  Fact - ExxonMobil supports women's health (Planned Parent)

NATO is obsolete in a world where war is to be disavowed.  Should a creation of WWII now around 70 years old remain in existence forever?  Trump haters will say yes, just because Trump has suggested that revisions might be appropriate especially in how NATO is funded, i.e. treaty members should all pay what the treaty demands.   Trump dares to question the sacred cows.  Generally speaking, this is good.  The anti-Trump crowd, who control most public discourse, may be shooting themselves in the foot by endorsing knee-jerk negative responses.  It is far better to consider each proposed action, undistorted by misrepresentation or hyperbole, and evaluate its positive and negative potential.

0,"Carl, it is not necessarily the VOTE that is rigged, but the electoral SYSTEM itself that is rigged, and has been for many decades --- always in favor of the pro-Establishment candidate(s), and virulently and often violently opposed to any sort of ANTI-Establishment candidate.  This is nothing new at all.  Just look at how the RNC and the corporate media undermined, attacked and subverted Ron Paul's strong and enthusiastic support in his presidential runs in 2008 and 2012.  The more the system, the Establishment, tries to quash dissent and reform, the more Trumps there will be rising up.  Clamping the lid down on the boiling kettle only ensures an eventual explosion.  THAT is what all the elites, and their spineless and conformist enablers, fail to recognize.

Then, when it appeared Trump had won the primary, the Republicans stopped supporting (i.e., paying for) the research. The Democrats then decided to go with the opps research that had been started by the Republicans - after all, why waste all that relevant research?  Yes, it's ugly, but it doesn't seem logical that this can all be blamed on the Democrats, does it?  I'm sure a lot of Republicans will be hiding their names and distancing themselves from their contributions to the research opps and attempts to trash Trump, and are more than happy to shunt the blame onto the Democrats.  The real question is: is any of it true? It doesn't matter who commissioned the research, but whether it's true that the Republicans collaborated with the Russians to influence the election.

1,"Calling that the comments contained in Vip Short's letter above """"really scary, and extremely undemocratic"""" is bizarre. Your comments suggest that those who object to the fascism and racism that Trump is promoting is seeking to squash dissent. But what Trump and his supporters are promoting is not dissent or mere differences in viewpoint but rather the very idea of a society based on the rule of law--equality before the law--and equal protection for everyone regardless of race, gender, disability, sex, etc. The white nationalist Republicans are attacking the rule of law and America itself. They are white supremacists and traitors. It's the reign of incompetent deplorables.
"
1,"I think that the seriousness of a pathological liar in position of president is very great.  Pathological liars are found in some personality disorder such as narcissistic personality disorder which many have claimed Trump suffers from. We all observed the world based on our personalities and then interpret those observations in distortions of memory. None of us are like tape recorders or video cameras but some perceptions of reality are greater deviations. The great danger may be that Trump really believes his distortions that are primarily centered on how he is perceived. People who have such major distortions should not be scientists or presidents.

If we don't get better at it, the major impetus for beefing up our military -- Trump's apparent unwillingness to continue the US role as protectorate -- will have evaporated by the time it is addressed.

0,"Richard, on your statement that a fish rots from the head, I will totally agree with you and elaborate from my observations. A number of years ago, it seems that party leadership, having been hounded by the membership to make the process of becoming a candidate more easy, backed off their influence on the process and let everyone who wanted to, become a candidate.  Well, for a while that seemed to work, candidates were still by and large upright and proper citizens whom the party could get behind.  And then came Trump and Ms. Stenger to show the fallacy of removed party leadership in candidate vetting. I am totally putting the blame on the respective parties leadership in letting the situation spiral out to this illogical conclusion - letting a ranting crazy woman who thinks she is the reincarnation of God and Trump to actually be a legitimate candidate.  The people of Hawaii need to demand of it's political parties a better selection of candidates moving forward from this year.

Just because Sarah Huckabee became a temporary, stand-in press secretary hardly means a thing. If there is a betrayal of American values it's not Trump's fault. He can barely read and is well despised. He grandstands. He promotes his own interests and had the audacity to suck up to Russia and its tiny dictator, Vladimir Putin. That's the real issue. If America refuses to resolve the issue it has with Trump's evil influence then it has no one to blame but itself.

In places with no affirmative action, like in California, Asian students are overrepresented three times over.  In other words, affirmative action helps black and white folks in the US. It is the siege mentality that many white Americans feel that they are under, which makes them think the system is against them. And makes them vote for Trump.

0,"""""Trumps presidency is on your candidate - Hillary Clinton - not on us.""""  No, Trump's presidency is on anyone who doesn't vote to prevent him from becoming president, and the only vote that matters in that respect is a vote for Hillary given the binary choice in our current political system.  You do not get to foist responsibility onto anybody else.  This is on everyone, those who choose to vote, and those who choose not to vote.  There is one responsible way to vote this time, and you are liable if you do not do the right thing.  Does it suck that this means voting for Hillary?  Guess so, depending on your perspective, but nobody ever promised the right thing would also be the easy or the feel-good thing.

Mike is the leader of a snarky, disingenuous, decidedly un-Christian media pundit career where, among other things, he insults Mexicans and laughs at gun violence.  His daughter has elected to be the mouthpiece of Trump whom you accurately  describe in this article.    It is very hard to reconcile the lengths she's gone to defend Trump with the term """"salt of the earth"""".  There is an ethic and a moral code that the Huckabees currently ignore when their immediate needs make it inconvenient.    I don't find anything so honorable in that.

0,"Many think that Trump will not move the US embassy to Jerusalem unless it's part of a negotiated deal between the Israelis and Palestinians.

Israel seems to be all but happy with Trumps, and the Palestinians are quiet out of fear of such a decision. A lot will depend on his visit to Saudi and what they may promise him if he does not follow suit with this plan.  Let's also not forget that Trump belong to a pro-Israeli church with wrong teachings about Christ, Muslims, and all Arabs at large. His daughter is married to a Jewish man that holds a high post in the WH. Chances are, he will declare it on this visit, and will cause more problems for people in the Middle East.

I can't see the stock market going much higher this year, in fact we've been in a bull market since 2009. There is absolutely nothing Trump can or will do to further stimulate a robust economy. In fact Trump can only makes things worse.

There is zero evidence of any widespread voter fraud in this or past elections. This brings up the question whether Donald Trump is psychologically unfit to be President, namely paranoid. If he is paranoid over a nonexistent issue like systemic voter fraud, how will he handle real issues like Russian, Chinese and Iranian hacking of our economic, military, government and energy grid internet infrastructure, ISIS, climate change. If elected President will his paranoia cause him to put troops on the streets to face a paranoid threat of ISIS in every American mosque? internment camps for Mexican Americans to face a paranoid threat they are helping their cousins cross over the borders. Paranoia in Trump's psychological makeup should be the issue, not voter fraud.

He licensed his name to Talon, the locally based builder and they probably indemnify Trump for any lawsuits or judgments under that arrangement.

The second idea has equal prosperity being the linchpin that would support the first idea.  If everyone was happy and doing well, there would be no need for armed conflict again over resources.  In hindsight very idealistic.  Human greed can never be underestimated, and Trump is the penultimate expression of that greed.  We are willing to cut out all that is important to our country to insure that the rich stay rich, and the economic gap continues to widen.

0,"""""Trouble is your thinking that merely because white Americans voted for a black man they can't be racist.""""  I've suggested nothing even remotely similar to that.  In fact, using the Socratic method, I take that assertion at face value and assume it to be true.  Then, assuming it's true, I plug that belief into a logical argument.  This is known as reductio ad absurdum.  So let's assume there are 60+ million racists in America because William says that anybody who votes for Trump is automatically a racist.  Simultaneously, if these people voted for Obama in a previous election, that does not mean they aren't racist.  Somehow, in this world, no evidence of racism does not indicate a lack of racism.  But, again, voting for Trump is considered automatic proof that a person is racist.  This is preschool level logic.  How could anyone with a college education think that argument makes any sense at all?  Are you even capable of thinking rationally about politics?

This so called news article provided a platform for Murkowski to push some unfounded talking points with no chance for any counter to the propaganda coming from Murkowski's aide.  This is pitiable, it's not journalism, it's not 'news' it's a public relations press release straight out of Murkowski's office.  We in Alaska need regulation on industry, we know what happens when there is not sufficient regulation.  Far from suffering from burdensome over-reach, we could use some more common sense regulation of industry.  The Trump plan to gut the EPA and the GOP going along with it is a disgrace.

He's had to tone things down while he's been in the White House.

He's going to go back to churn up the base he developed for Trump and try to enlarge it.  If anything this signals the start of Trump's re-election campaign for 2020.  So now to the midterm elections, Bannon will use his machine to single out the Republicans up for election who are not on board with his message.

0,"That's true but we also have the largest economy when looking at the rest of NATO and spend more on our military than the other NATO countries. If Trump has his way our military spending will increase again thus raising our GDP % spent on military. But that doesn't mean we are going to spend that increase in the NATO countries. Also US troops stationed in Germany have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. US troops injured in those wars are sent to US military hospitals in Germany. European realestate is valuable to the US military mission. I think NATO should be reviewed and updated in regards to the stability of Europe regardless of if US stays or goes or contributes less to NATO. We are one of two countries that are part of NATO but not part of Europe. The 2% GDP makes sense for European countries. Some of these countries are tiny when compared to our military and our economy. That said I wish Trump wasn't so embarrassing. I have more respect for the German Chancellor than I do of Donald.

Since the Republicans hold the majority and control the country why is it that Trump can't pass any meaningful legislation? Trump is a functional illiterate and can't put together a sensible sentence. He's a vain, old, doddering fool. He pouts because he's being exposed as a hypocrite. Tell me, since the Republicans hang their hat on family values, why is that Trump is not vilified for his numerous marriages, for his numerous affairs and for his gross and despicable behavior. Don't you remember what he said about women? What a coincidence that at the same time, campaign subterfuge from the Russians erupted. Trump has become the laughing stock of the nation and the world. He is widely mocked at home and abroad. Oh, wait, there are a few individuals who still shamelessly draw breath from his dying, decaying body.

Hilary wins out over Trump in a two party campaign.  How do we get the big money out of politics?  The Supreme Court can only change this.  Hilary's nominees will be far better than Trump's.  The question is will humans be on the planet in 100 years.  The rate of decay and climate change may wipe us off the earth.

I doubt that's Trump, but I know for sure it is NOT Queen Hillary. She's always thought herself the smartest person in any room, even during her husband's presidency.

The timing of Bissonnette's actions suggest that it was Trudeau's impulsive tweet saying Canada would  take in all the people refused by Trump's ban that triggered him, i.e. it had the opposite of the effect you and Taylor are claiming.  He must have felt his government was telling him his concerns were being summarily dismissed, and it just aggravated his feelings of anger and alienation from society, leading to an impulsive violent act which he immediately regretted.

A private for-profit FAA will get its funding mostly from the airlines. One of the expected outcomes of FAA privatization is the further restriction of airline access to community airports given  service into most of them runs at a loss. It'll also be a likely burden on general aviation. But, they'll have happier big airline customers.  The FAA today sometimes acts in the interest of the public and not the airlines. It's in their charter to do so. But not so with a private FAA which is trying to make a profit.

This leads me to conclude that the man doesn't actually remember what he has said or realize the full extent of what he is saying. In this, he's a bit like de Gaulle; """"Vive le Quebec libre!"""". Maybe, like de Gaulle, he'll just quit if he doesn't get his own way. Lets hope so.

0,"It appears one of Obama's last desperate attempts at a legacy was something called Plan 2014 which he pushed through last December weeks before the end of his presidency.  Another environmental initiative, Plan 2014 was approved by the IJC and designed to NOT allow the annual draining/lowering of Lake Ontario's water level on the theory that having the lake reach its natural water level would be better for the plants, fish and other natural life living in the lake.  So the IJC didn't do weeks ago what they had normally done and what they are now being forced by the flooding to do after great inconvenience and billions in damages and a mostly lost summer for the many people who live or visit or have seasonal niche businesses along the Lake Ontario's shifting shore line.  This costly mistake of feel good environmentalism added an estimated 10 centimeters  more water along much of the Lake Ontario shoreline for weeks.  Thanks, Barack.  (Myself, I blame Trump and the Russians.)

Leftie blue states give more to the Federal government than they receive while the opposite is true for red states - with McConnell's and Rand Paul's Kentucky near the top for taking more than they contribute.  In fact, blue states float the boat of the US so you are clearly wrong about saying we prefer everyone to be dirt poor.  In fact, we support and pay into social programs for a social safety net to prevent impoverishment and abject poverty while the Republicans don't.

Or, suppose """"GUN VIOLENCE"""" were the touchstone behavior (definitely a risk to national security, I think everyone would agree).  Identify the nationalities of gun violence perpetrators and exclude all sharing that nationality? How about gratuitous and open disrespect for governmental institutions.  Or expressions of ANGER toward governmental institutions or officials?  Risks to national security?  Something to look into?  Should we also assume, as a nation, that """"expression of anger"""" behavior by one or a few of a given nationality should mean all sharing that nationality or those nationalities are also suspect to the point of exclusion? Trumpian logic says whoever, of whatever persuasion and viewpoint, occupies the Federal executive seat can identify and target those nationalities for exclusion.

The media, US instutitions and sane US citizens are not going away. With every act he makes new enemies for himself and strengthens their commitment; he has his followers, but he gains no new friends. He will fail because he cannot corrupt the courts, and because even the most timid senator sooner or later will say “enough.” He will fail most of all because at the end of the day most Americans, including most of those who voted for him, are decent people who have no desire to live in an American version of Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey, or Viktor Orban’s Hungary, or Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

He cannot use a stick to bend the governments of sanctuary cities to his will, but he can use a carrot. He can ask Congress for legislative grants of funds to cities conditioned upon their compliance with certain federal immigration laws.”  The last sentence is the key.   With Republicans in control of Congress, it can and should be done quickly.

0,"I don't necessarily believe William Jefferson's denials, but I do believe Trump was speaking the truth about his behavior described on the tape, and I think the women coming forward now are confirming it. Trump has been a virtual despot within his moneyed kingdom, with a power over those in his immediate sphere that Clinton rarely, if ever, had over the women in his sphere of public office. Also, Trump has not had the entire republican party after him for political gain, an impeachment that had the power to examine Trump's entire recorded history and to probe him for details, and to call interview witnesses at will. If Trump were impeached right now, I bet Clinton would look like an amateur abuser compared to Trump.  I will also wager a lot that Trump chose his targets very skillfully, i.e., those who needed his approval like the contestants of the pageants, women whose jobs were dependent on his approval, and women who had insufficient personal and economic power to fight back.

1,"The USCCB needs to come out with a very strong statement very, very soon, which unequivocally makes it clear that anyone who harbors racist feelings, considers him- or herself a white supremacist, or feels the need to continue to support the present wreck  called Trump Administration, can no longer be and is no longer a Catholic.  If they fail to do so, then Pope Francis needs to do that for them by means of an Encyclical, in American English, addressed to American Catholics first (pun intended), and Catholics worldwide, using the same title, and issuing very similar warnings, as the famous Encyclical of Pius XI. in 1937, which was published in German: """"Mit Brennender Sorge"""". Its American equivalent will need to be """"With Grave Concern"""" (San Diego's brilliant bishop can draft it).  The trouble is, not a few US bishops wanted Trump in office - for reasons well known, but this basest of abominations is what they got.  Shame on them!

The USCCB looks for any excuse to marginalize and negate the work of democrats they should declare themselves a wing of the GOP. Trump should address the UND students and faculty.

That companies get to write the actual wording of policies (rather than government), and insurance companies get to make the actuarial calculations (rather then government) is a technical difference that does not change the nature of a health care system as relatively more capitalist or socialist.

Of course, McConnell isn't just wrong about the timing of the accelerating Obama recovery which in the second and third quarters of 2014 had ramped up long before a GOP takeover of the Senate seemed likely. As it turns, the Republican Party deserves zero credit for the improving American economy. Make that less than zero. After all, from their opposition to the stimulus, the auto industry rescue and the Fed's """"quantitative easing"""" to their debt-ceiling hostage taking and draconian austerity policies in Washington and the states, Republicans have been sabotaging the economic recovery from the moment Barack Obama first took the oath of office. And Trump will trash it to bankruptcy like he to did all his casinos,

From globalist Republicans to Red Guard Progressives: they attend the same colleges and Universities they date and marry the same people.  They carry these incestrous relationships into culture and government. Their belief in democratic values is purely theoretical and is little more than lip service. It doesn't surprise me that the author of this article doesn't like Donald Trump. What surprises me is her lack of self awareness when comes to her political beliefs. She seems to think that her values are not just opinions but mandates from woke heaven.

The trouble began when the county coroner decided the skeleton was that of a white man, despite an obsidian arrowhead buried in the pelvis. He sent a fragment of bone off for carbon dating and it came back 10,000 years old. So the lunatic fringe started trumpeting """"White people were here first! We are the original indigenous persons!"""" There are a number of fringe groups in the Columbia Basin promoting this. The scientists didn't seem to care what the law said. The irony is if they'd asked the Umatillas if they could do some testing they probably would have been given the OK. But they didn't bother to ask. Can anybody say """"Same old same old?""""

There were a ton of projects around the Denver metro area in 2010 and onward that had signs attributing the construction to the stimulus, so like it or not, it had to have helped some.

The first is to create as wide a chasm as possible between French Muslims and the rest of the French, seeing it as a recruiting opportunity. The more ordinary Muslims are isolated and discriminated against, the more hopeless and resentful they will become, and the more easily they can be radicalized. The second is that LePen ensures a weaker European Union, which again plays right into their plans. Trump of course supports LePen because she shares a similar set of intolerant beliefs, and because he sees a united Europe as a challenge to American hegemony. Objectively,  if you support LePen, you are siding with ISIS and Trump.

The Southstream and other pipelines were intended precisely to bypass Ukraine, and avoid such unintended cutoffs of supply to other countries. Hard to see any benefits in this to the average American, who will have to pay higher natural gas prices because of these exports.

Trudeau is puppet get over it  Soros, Khan, unions, and bureaucrats tell him who to blow Like today for instance. The oligarchy is so afraid of trump they have told jug-head to hike up his yoga pants super tight and take on for the team......  Th outcome of today will be huge losses of jobs in Canada, as well as expensive access to markets. You can kiss the dairy boards goodbye.

0,"Hate and bigotry in America and the rise of Donald Trump.  As President Obama was celebrating his first inauguration, top Republican lawmakers and strategists were conjuring up ways to submarine his presidency at a private dinner in Washington. There has been a racial divide and unrest across the land ever since. Included were Republican Reps. Eric Cantor, Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan, Pete Sessions, Jeb Hensarling, Pete Hoekstra, and Dan Lungren, along with Republican Sens. Jim DeMint, Jon Kyl, Tom Coburn, John Ensign, and Bob Corker.  The non-lawmakers present included Newt Gingrich and Frank Luntz, the long-time Republican wordsmith. Notably absent were Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader John Boehner.  For several hours in the Caucus Room of a high-end D.C. establishment, they plotted out ways to not just win back political power, but to also put the brakes on Obama's legislative platform. They succeeded. And here we are.

The damages it has done to Canada since 1990, economically, in banking, in trade, and in wars, in terror is immense indeed. This is fact. Future danger will be greater.

Human rights are being attacked by the right wing religious groups who seem to have a vision of America quite antithetical to democracy and more akin to theocracy.  People who voted for Trump may be been frustrated with all kinds of things but he is bad news.  Not my  vision of what America could be. Is it yours?

0,"Trump is sacrificing international relations, economic progress, and environmental sustainability all for the sake of his personal political gain.

The next question is whether he forgot to check his own paperwork?  Doubtful and unlikely.  He knew that he would get caught, again, passing """"Flynn facts"""" so it seems doubtful he left things out of it on accident even if the expected legal review was denied. Perhaps like he was relying on coordinating with the WH and Trump's inner circle on what could be covered up/wouldn't be """"zealously vetted"""" by the Trump WH's OGE?

After his first few weeks I was saying, """"Where's a good community organizer when we really need one? In the White House."""" And now that's Obama's legacy - his utter failure to keep any of his promises to ordinary Americans  succeeded in organizing the entire country Against him. Left and right, the large majority of Americans are well-organized  behind Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, hoping with the audacity of hope that one or the other can make the changes Obama reneged on. Martin Luther King would be very sad to see what Obama has done and left undone. And that's Obama's legacy - his passive lack of character has allowed Donald Trump to turn the American Dream into the American Nightmare. Americans will now go where no Americans have gone before - into that final frontier, the frontier of fascism. God help the United States of America.

He claims the playing field is not level and interestingly, most America trade experts agree with him. So exactly how is he being a bully when he's simply standing up for his own country?  The only way that our incompetent, delusional Liberal government can manage this trade issue is to try and convince him, and other American experts who agree with him, otherwise.  Good-luck.

That's why the Secretaries under Obama were PhD nuclear physicists, one of them a Nobel Prize winner. Perry has an undergraduate degree in animal husbandry.

Before 2020, Trump might fire Mueller, however like Comey, Mueller both are smart lawyers and G-men who plan for all contingencies and has already planned for the scenario of getting fired while investigsting the Trumps and will already have a poison pill plan to legally release even more damaging dirt on Trump, Trump Jr and his son in law Jared.

0,"well as a boost it largely comes down to this. With every populist victory. Brexit, Trump, etc, it both increases the exposure of such positions, while reducing the media and the Liberal Lefts ability to name and shame people back into the prefered way of thinking and voting. The biggest reason the Brexit polling and teh Trump polling was so far off is huge portions of those electorates simply stopped responding to the media and pollsters. They didn't want to deal with the name calling. They just went quietly into the private election booths and pulled the lever that corresponded with their feelings. But with each win, or each populist uprising, they more and more realize, they are not alone. That they are greater in number than the media shame merchants. There is strength in numbers. There is strength in community. A strong Geert Wilders showing communicates to many French voters that voting for LePen is not some far out there proposition that one should be ashamed of.

0,"Well Nels here is another side to your story. Capitol Journal Single-payer healthcare in California? By George SkeltonContact Reporter Capitol Journal The annual cost was eye-popping: $400 billion. Of that, $200 billion would come from existing federal, state and local funding for healthcare. The remaining $200 billion would have to be raised from higher taxes. Spending on Medi-Cal healthcare for the poor is projected at about $106 billion. It covers a third of Californians. Of the spending, $68 billion is expected from the Trump administration. The state general fund is down for just $18.6 billion. Still, that’s 15% of the $124-billion general fund. But if all this dream-world stuff happened, there’d still be between $50 billion and $100 billion in new money needed to fund a single-payer healthcare system. There’d be no premiums, co-pays or deductibles — and therefore no self controls. So who knows how steep new medical costs would climb?

Trump's traditional conservative cabinet believes in small government, which means that it will do little for society, serving instead the corporate oligarchy. People who voted for change will find this government all too familiar. The population will find their situations no better by the end of the term.

STILL, who in his right mind believes that killing a child just a few days short of birth is different from killing a born-alive baby?  Yet, this is what Clinton supports.  And she will appoint a Supreme Court who sees it her way.  Granting that Trump would be the worst President ever --- and I do believe he would be --- how could we justify electing Clinton?   We would be horrified if asked to vote for a President who would authorize the enslavement of, say, 3,000 black people.  Such a person should never be elected, no matter what else.

Trump says the majority of Americans will be able to file their taxes on one page...43 percent already file 1040EZ or 1040A. Big deal. This is all about transferring literally billions of dollars to the richest 400 families in the country instead of fixing road, bridges, schools, paying for defense, healthcare and other support programs and it's estimated to add 1 to 4 trillion to the deficit.

It was the saddest of times, a time of vitriolic anti-liberalism,  fueled by Christian evangelism, that almost destroyed university controversy and a pivotal time when the concept of """"liberal democracy"""" took a severe hit.

If not, well the mid-term elections are coming.  Though one thing for sure. Trump is no fool. He can read the public very well. Thus he stopped his adopted party from getting rid of the authority of a non partisan ethics advisor.

Even if Trump and the Russians had signed an agreement, I have been told that their is no statute that makes it illegal.  You may not like the notion, but that does not make it illegal.  Moreover, Flynn has not been indicted for anything, much less convicted, and thus if you are an American and abide by our constitution you must treat Flynn as innocent until proven guilty by a jury of his peers.  The visceral dislike of many for Trump allows them to imagine crimes where only distaste plays a role in their perception.

Probably. IS Donald corrupt? probably. The difference is the Trump administration has been caught lying again and again in its first 6 months of office.

0,"There is no doubt that the speech of Trump, including vocabulary is on the 12-13 year old level. But ironically it seems to work for him so far.  Maybe he understands the public in general or at least his base.   Personally I take Trump very seriously but not literally; e.g. his inaugural address really duplicated his campaign platform. Some I agree with, some I do not. So if we raise the question """"Is President Trump honest?"""", the answer depends upon the register of seriousness or importance of the question. So it is possible to say he is extremely dishonest and also extremely honest, depending upon the register of the event or communication in question.

Strange loses, surging poll tweets are gone. This little ditty illuminates Trump's real issues just as much as his comments on kneeling NFL players.  Trump is about his ratings, always his ratings.  It doesn't take deep dark conspiracies to figure out Trump will play to his base and that he thinks losing his base is tantamount to losing everything. Unfortunately, his base includes lots of entitled white males so confederate flags next to the US flag is perfectly fine, kneeling black football players protesting police targeting is not.

Any PBS program worth anything like Sesame Street will quickly find homes on other stations and channels.   And if rural stations are hit first by PBS losing federal funding, it will not be because of the loss of federal funds; instead, it will be because how BPS distributes its own funds to 1,400 radio and TV stations around the country.

Rail, homelessness, overdevelopment, prison-packing and more: These local problems all deserve our attention. We have a right to participate in their solutions, and there is ample opportunity to do so.  Sanctuary status is altogether different. It is a definitional issue, declaring and confirming who we are as a people in the face of a would-be despot who demands that we be otherwise. As burdensome as it could be, adopting it is necessary. If we are people of aloha, we must live that aloha beyond bumper stickers.

On the defensive side, Trump has made it clear that North Korea could not win in a nuclear conflict with the US.  Trump is not threatening aggressive action unless we are provoked.  But he is needling the little rodent unmercifully.  He knows that no personal insult could ever be an international justification for a military aggression.  So he makes fun of Kim in order to get him worked up enough so that China becomes concerned that Kim might do something stupid and intervenes.  Not a bad strategy.

If that was correct, China would hardly need to use some of its US dollar assets to DEFEND (raise the value of) the yuan (buy it up in FX markets).  The market pressure would be UP, and China would be selling yuan to cap its value (see Japan over 50 years, intervening when the yen threatened to go over a US penny in value!).  The real cost advantages of China are in forcible wage suppression, tolerance of pollution, economies of scale, and (to give credit where due) plain old good workers.

CAPP & TCPL  for a number of years were so confident Keystone was going to be passed they didn't even have a lobbyist in Washington. 4. CAPP & TCPL were so clueless they didn't even have the value of US imports required in Oilsands operations so that when Obama said Keystone was only going to support about 30 full time American jobs they didn't even have a response.  At least they finally got that corrected. 5.  TCPL was also clueless in initially purchasing pipe from Korea instead of US, something Trump had them change.

Stand up, peacefully, for what you believe in .  If that is tolerance the majority will approve.  If you stand with Trump, it will be good to know where you are.

1,"The hard truth to accept is this is (sadly) the new normal. If you’re shocked now that Trump is lying, or continuing to lie, you’re behind the eight ball. If all of the “not my president” people continue to be shocked that Trump is a liar, cheat, fraud, racist, sexist, con man, etc. etc. etc., come the end of the term all of his supporters will simply re-elect him for the sake of it or “let’s give him a chance” to make America grate again. The other half of America will need to get off their as* and vote him out.

It's incredible  This excerpt is taken from an interview that was w/Trump, plus son Eric by James Dodson.  Here is a very, very interesting quote from that interview: """"Trump was strutting up and down, talking to his new members about how they were part of the greatest club in North Carolina,"""" Dodson says. """"And when I first met him, I asked him how he was — you know, this is the journalist in me — I said, 'What are you using to pay for these courses?' And he just sort of tossed off that he had access to $100 million.""""  Shortly after that conversation took place, James Dodson and Eric Trump teed off behind the foursome that included Donald Trump.

It’s a self-serving fantasyland that requires constant b.s. to fertilize the faithful.  One of those faithful, finding himself on the front lines of this dangerous war while watching basketball at a Kansas bar, shot and killed an Indian-born engineer and wounded his friend and another guy who tried to intervene.  Somehow, this man with 51 years of life experiences behind him believed the men were ‘Middle Eastern’ and therefore acceptable to kill.  He then drove about an hour or so into rural southwest Missouri and confessed to a bartender.  We still don’t know whether this ignoramus just sobered up enough on the drive to confess his heinous act or if he thought the bartender would give him a medal.  The bartender called the police.

Then you have to admit at least that what he spoke is unsubstantiated. So when the president makes unsubstantiated claims is that not a cause for alarm? The size of his inauguration crowd is petty – making an accusation that there is widespread voter fraud is NOT. Especially when it is leading to actions such as massive information gathering into a central database and unnecessary calls for voter ID laws. This is just one example.  I have said this before, and it still has bearing if or if not he """"lied"""". I said at it's worse he is a liar - but at the least he is, as you said, making unsubstantiated claims. He is carelessly managing the office of the presidency with wild accusations and mis-truths. Technically lying or not really doesn't change why his statements are an issue.

But exactly how many cases is he going to rule on this year that have any spectre of involving Trump, the Republicans, or the US Federal Government or Trump voters, given that he's an Ontario Provincial Justice? Conflicts of interest typically require a possible biased ruling.  If that biased ruling isn't even truly a possibility due to context, there's no possible compromise to the justice's impartiality.

So why did he try to lie to the American people by setting up Rosenstein as the ax man?  In addition, if getting """"the Russian thing"""" done right he could appoint a special prosecutor.  He could have tasked Rosenstein with finding the right replacement instead of fabricating a three page lie. These two things leads me to believe both of the reasons he's offered to the American people are lies and there might just be something damning in the FBI's investigations.  Of course, it's always possible that Trump just forgot to fire him a while ago and doesn't want to fess up about being a forgetful old man.  His tendency to distrust others doesn't help.

0,"I have personally been involved in the process of extracting an employee incarcerated by a hostile state on trumped up charges (Libya under Gadhafi), so I have an insight into the means by which an individual's home country works with third parties both NGO and diplomatic to effect their release.  Lim was the only Canadian being held by North Korea.  To suggest the PM was not involved or informed of the process undertaken to secure his release is laughable.  Do not confound Trudeau with Trump.  And to your point, there has been no statement made by the Canadian government which reflects negatively on the NK government - stating that your are pleased with the outcome and thanking the intermediaries involved is hardly damning - as noted in the article, sending an respected emissary allowed the North Koreans to save face.  Seriously....get over it.

As mentioned, for all the insanity of his personal behavior the generals and Rex Tillerson are doing a good job in foreign policy. Finally America has taken a stand against North Korea, Pakistan and Russia. The concept that Trump is pro Putin is ridiculous. He has been putting a finger in Putin's eye for months. The generals are being allowed to fight the wars instead of minor decisions being made by White House politicos.  What is being obscured by his madness is the misbehavior of groups like Antifa, basically a terrorist group against free speech, and Southern Poverty Leadership,  a group dedicated to smearing anyone who disagrees with them.

His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of “others” — Muslims, Hispanics, women, Chinese, Mexicans, Europeans, Arabs, immigrants, refugees — whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision. His program, such as it is, consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion. He will deport them, bar them, get them to knuckle under, make them pay up or make them shut up.""""

As we approach 7.5 billion by year's end, 2016, it would perhaps be appropriate to pause and reflect on this. We are 2.5 billion away from reaching  total carrying capacity: 2.5 billion/82 million per year = 87 years (IF rates remain constant, which they do not - so, more like 30 years, TOPS!).  AND WE ALREADY CAN'T FEED EVERYONE.  As for being """"bold enough to be their superstore"""", these industrial groceries aren't very healthy and certainly not sustainable.

But instead of looking at that, we have elected a man who seems to have no problems with people suffering even more. What happens to the 20 million plus who have no health insurance. What happens to the disable and elderly when Medicare and SS is dismantled. What about those of color or people of other faiths. Trump has done little to separate himself from his racist views especially with who he is choosing who will be his closest advisor.  All these things that Trump stands for are views Catholics and Christian should not support. Those who voted for Trump because of abortion has excepted his other evils as OK. Since abortion is a personal choice some women will chose it legal or not or who is in office.

That formula of hard work and dedication is no longer secure.  The unions have failed to protect jobs because there is no protection against the growth of knowledge.  They have found a hero in an 70 year old guy who thinks he can drag the nation back to his own childhood when being male was enough to get you work.

This is about profits for the few at the expense of many, both today and in future generations.  BTW, the train wreck that is the Trump administration might implode before the midterm elections. There is little chance the American electorate isn't going to oust Trump and many Republicans in a backlash against his self serving policies and many ethical and business conflicts.

Treason, aiding and abetting an enemy seemingly can be overlooked in the single-minded pursuit of this goal. The party which wraps itself in the flag and whose members talk about patriotism as if their party alone loves this country and will fight to the death to defend it from all enemies is completely baffling to me now and apparently to Joe Scarborough as well. Their silence on Russian interference in our election and the profiteering of the Trump family while Donald Trump is president is deafening. Shameful.

There are international prohibitions against the use of chemical weapons. To let Assad get away with using them would normalize their use and lead to the proliferation of chemical weapons and that is not a place we want to be. If it makes you feel better, I think the Trump administration is fine with the Assad regime slaughtering innocent people with conventional weapons.

A party within a party sounds interesting.  I like the idea of anti corruption, safe food, environmental preservation, non-GMO, small development, police oversight, government accountability and limited dependence on unions money.  Starting to sound like a democracy.  Lot's of money as described by science professor Colin Moore between politicians, unions and developers currently plague traditional democrats.  Another Moore, Gordon Moore (Intel co-founder) had a law that said something about transistors doubling every year.  Maybe the progressives can double every year.  Who knows?

There are much more conservative and less well educated judges who could appear on the bench there.

I suppose the issue is really one of balance as the author of the piece notes. With so many seats potentially up for grabs during Trump's tenure we may have seen his most moderate choice. I am less happy about that than you and prefer a more moderate, middle course for the judiciary.

( that could even go for people like bank robbers, etc.)  1. True. 2. This has always existed. 3. Trump, during his campaign, even enticed people at his rallies to be violent with people protesting him, anc he would pay their legal fees.  Perhaps the bigger question is why something that is a remnant of imperial rule exists at all?

0,"Manafort's problems ran through the campaign and into today. In fact, Manafort resigned (or as Trump says now-- he was fired) as his problems heated up while he was Chairman for the Campaign. HIs problems and Trump's problems are similar and overlap, but Trump has been more successful in dealing with them (he has been in money laundering and fraud lawsuits but he pulled out or his lawyers protected him well--the one exception being a project where he paid part of a $10 Million fine either directly or by surrendering his interest to someone else who took care of him. Manafort is dangerous for Trump because he is likely to know of Trump's financial connections to the Russian oligarchs that go back to the time when both were taking advantage of those relationships (with oligarchs that officed in Trump tower and lived in Trump's Florida apartments). Without a guy like Manafort turning on him, Trump is hard to get because he has been protected by his shrewdness and his attorney.
"
0,"Your reply is not the best, but I take it you do not accept the repeated conclusions before the public and Congress by the FBI, NSA and CIA on Russian hacking and social media cyber attacks. The most recent being both Comey and US Attorney General Jeff Sessions speaking in strong support of those conclusions in front of the US Senate and on video across the country. The US Senate bipartisan vote the other day to increase sanctions against Russia for, among other things, Russian action to influence the election was 98-2. That bill also limits Trump's ability to change sanctions against Russia. So almost the entire US Senate voted for the bill that includes sanctions for the Russian cyber attack on the US election-- they need tinfoil hats too?

Trump only knows autocratic management, he's a rich kid that inherited his German dad's hard work, made a mess of it.  He destroyed numerous small businesses when he'd take bankruptcy, or his Trump discount when the small contractor to his ego projects needed paid.  The Democratic did not create this guy, the right wing propaganda machine you're quoting did.  The National Socialist Party in Germany was not founded by Hitler, it was commandeered for his own purposes.  Trump has commandeered the GOP.

The Democrats had very close ties with Russia and Mr. Putin and yet when they lost the election began a smear campaign indicating that Trump somehow worked with Russia to hijack the election.  The Democrats have been poor losers and seem intent upon continuing a process of disrupt and destroy to hijack the US government. If one or more individuals did something inappropriate then they should be brought to task for this.  We should start with Hillary but everyone knows that won't happen.  So far two individuals have been indicted - Republicans - for work they did outside of the Trump Campaign.  The next person - Hillary's man, seems to be immune from prosecution from an independent prosecutor who is a Hillary man.  Is it any wonder no one has faith in the process?

Alt-left created such things as political correctness to control your speech, safe space for minority who appears to embraced segregation, Black Lives Matters to protect thugs and so on.  Above all, more then the alt-right, alt-left have given us this racial divide that this nation is currently having. Thus far, the alt-left has been far worst then alt-right which is nothing but your same old KKK and neo-skinheads wrapped in a new Christmas wrapping.

You bend over backwards and do multiple contortions to give yourself reasons to NOT look at Trump’s tax returns. Normal, educated people know about tax deductions and ways that a smart business person can pay little or no taxes.  That is NOT why Trump is hiding his tax returns. You know that—if true—he would love to show off how much money he makes and how smart he is at taking deductions.  So what is he hiding?  Congratulations to your father for doing well with his nursing home. But I guess nobody ever accused him of taking money from Putin, and he never was responsible for managing the nation’s finances. Trump is not your dad.  Same question:  WHAT is Trump hiding?

I'm not overly concerned that Russia tried to interfere in our political campaign.    We know for fact that our own country has done much worse in an attempt to influence 'regime change'.

Trump, for good or bad, is making manifest so many problems in the system, which is so much bigger than any one person. There can be good to come out of this, but will people want it?

Conclusion: The major media gave Trump millions of dollars of free air time to boost their ratings and thus boosted Trump to the nomination.

The daily antics from the commander and chief reveal what we should have known all along. Trump is a bully and a dangerous narcissist whose protection of his over inflated ego takes precedence over everything else, even the feelings of a grieving widow of a fallen soldier.

Then you've just destroyed whatever credibility you claim to have.  (Hint: Being from Chicago isn't something to brag about.)  Trump is every bit as corrupt as Clinton.  Probably more.  If he ever gets into political office then you'll be able to call it 'political corruption'.  For now it's plain vanilla corruption.

0,"In “The Trump Card“ Ivanka recounts how she and her siblings Eric and Donald Jr. came up with a “scheme” that involved selling fake Native American arrowheads to their friends.  “We’d chip away at them until they looked somewhat authentic, like actual ancient arrowheads and then bury them in strategic spots so that we could come across them while we were running around with our friends,” Ivanka writes.  “At that point, we’d turn around and sell them for a nice profit — around five dollars or so, depending on the piece and what we thought the market could bear.”  It’s not atypical kid stuff, but considering how her dad has become for running cons and shortchanging thousands, it suggests they absorbed their father’s business outlook.

0,"A thoughtful piece of work. However, to state that """"[b]ut what really separates Quebeckers from other Canadians is their antipathy toward public manifestations of religion"""" and to reinforce it by stating that """" [i]n the rest of Canada, tolerance of religious diversity goes hand in hand with support for multiculturalism"""" are  statements completely oblivious to the subterraneous nature of this issue.  You will note the effect of it at the speed of flick of a switch. The Trudeau effect, unless moderated, is likely to produce a post-Obama after effect of Trump era.  Public manifestations of religion is meant to divide the people, especially the modern humanity.  We all know and must accept that in your face exhibition of purportedly religious piece of clothing is an instant statement of : I am different and my value system is different and I will not compromise on my absorbed values.  Spirituality and clothing are not synonymous. Quebec model, as correctly stated ,  is not xenophobic.

0,"cwg, Glad to have you back Although I still do not feel as you and the Acton Institute do. Also I think Trump may just finally settle at least some of these questions about the intrinsic value of money and the GOP worship thereof. For me it is truly amazing how the GOP mixes patriotism, religion and money with Trickle-down economics of the ancient British variety with the devastation of human life. No doubt Trump will be a very interesting prez if we survive. The American Catholic hierarchs certainly wanted him to win the election. Now we'll watch how soon they will repudiate him and/or excuse themselves. IF Trump does good things for the American workers and their families it still will not excuse his nasty way of winning the election. But at least the people will be better off.

End of story.  Doesn't mean that the FBI investigations would stop.  But dems, of course, only care about how much political capital they can make out of this even though it hurts our country.

If a real actionable threat became know, there is a process in place, and the US security and border services would not have been caught off guard as they were. So the ban was signed sealed and delivered by Trump and his inner circle, based on their own biases and ideologies, but not on facts.  And if a threat to the SB did exist because of his election win, what on earth would make you think that the targets of his ban would be the ones targeting him? Trump is a gift to terrorists everywhere as much as he is a gift to Vladimir Putin.  Trump swore to uphold the law and the constitution. The judge made the same oath, roughly.

Bill Clinton paid two fines, $90,000 and $25,000 and had his law license suspended voluntarily for 5 years in AR to prevent disbarment and to end the investigation for giving intentionally false testimony, on 3 separate occasions, in the Paula Jones case. Before you start doing the liberal thing about how many repubs have been unfaithful, not one committed perjury in a court of law. Trump has not done so either.

His voters will love him for going forward with the wall.  Now clearly points a and b are absurd. Trump shows here, as he does in every action or word or tweet, how pathetically out of his depth he is. Point c, however, is the reason Trump is in the White House. As H.L Mencken wisely observed - """"For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong."""" Trump's reality show honed air of faux confidence convinced sixty million Americans that his clear and simple answers were their salvation. His supporters are too thick to appreciate Mencken's wisdom, and Trump is too busy reveling in their adoration to care.

It already happened in the 1930s. We whitewash the time when the KKK had branches in cities & town across Canada. You will have to do a bit of research to find references to this period but the references can be found. Very shocking period.  We don't like to talk about not allowing Jews to enter Canada to escape Hitler. Read the book """"None is Too Many"""" to describe  our immigration policy during that period.  Go to Wikipedia and read about the university thesis written by TC Douglas. The father of Medicare, former leader of the federal NDP, former NDP premier, the greatest Canadian according to the CBC.

Tigerswan entered the North Dakota standoff about the time Obama intervened to order a full environmental evaluation of the pipeline. This gesture proved to be futile, and as soon as he was elected, Trump gave the pipeline the green light. Money talks.

The NATO alliance requires 2% GDP from each country for that nation to arm, defend, and if necessary, deploy and sustain its forces in a war zone for an indefinite time.  If a nation in the alliance, cannot do this, they are less than mission capable and a drain on other nation's capabilities.  Which means if we want them in the fight, the US and other nations then have to drain our resources to pay for them to be there, and usually as I saw in Afghanistan and Iraq, they do little or no fighting.  This means our military expenditures have to go up which gets at the military industrial complex you write about.  But what Trump is pointing out in his own inarticulate way is nation X gets to spend their portion of defense spending on social programs instead.  Wouldn't you rather have nation's X military budget go up so ours can go down?  We are and have been the """"mark"""" in this game for decades.

If it were other Muslim majority countries would have been included in the travel ban.  Second, Islam is in need of reform as demonstrated by actions of ISIS and similar religiously inspired terror groups not to mention 9-11.  Last time I checked Bhuddists, Christians, Jews and Hindus are largely able to control their urges to kill innocents in the name of their faith.  Just remember next time you board an airplane and complain about intrusive security measures what religion makes that necessary.  Add to that they way the way Islam treats LGBT's and women and you have a fairly intolerant and violent bunch. Understand not all Muslims are terrorists but almost all terrorists are Muslims.  Mr. Trump knows this and is acting accordingly.

The fact is that media credibility has been severely damaged by playing to partisan consumers and the restoration of any semblance of public confidence is not going to be achieved by government subsidies. One has only to look at the fact there is far less public faith in politicians than the relatively low ratings for journalists.

A sidenote-- he gave Trump job growth that set a record second only to Clinton. and an umatched recovery and 7 year record growth in the stock market. Trump gets credit for what he does, but he should not knock Obama for what he gave us. My point on who paid for the dossier was that is was all in the news from a long time back-- from a year ago.

The past 15 years the state of Alaska has seen a steady , incremental , decline in the number of registered Republicans. Two years ago this was addressed by Gerrymandering districts, and placing people in office by giving them a district that contained the majority of voting Republicans. People like John Coghill were beneficiaries of selective voters, and unseated two Democrats that were blocking SB-21. Now the leader of their party is questioning the validity of the voting process, even after Gerrymandering in their favor took place. THEY are the """"rigged"""" system both politically, and economically. Supply side """" Trickle Down """" economics creates Monopolies , not jobs.

The man is a liar , crooked to the core, incompetent, and possibly insane or mentally incompetent.

As (maybe Churchill) said, it is too bad that youth is wasted on the young.  All of the ideals are great.  And the young like ideals.  But once they get a job, buy a house, have a kid, and realize that the ideals cost money and they are the ones who are going to pay for it, what do they do?  They switch to the conservative vote.  But hey, it is all a wash anyway.  Conservative, liberal, whatever, it's all just a waste of time and big joke to make the average person think we have a role to play.

Just don't feed the beast. Besides, I really don't see how a populist 'uprising' can work based on single member districts utilizing first past the post. Neither Brexit or Trump were fully embraced by their respective political parties - politics in a team sport in Canada and without a united team - you're far less likely to win and even less likely to govern. This populism will only fracture the Conservatives on the right and the Dippers on the left and leave the Liberals with comfortable majorities of the centre.

So now you know the Kool Aid you drank has you trippin' so bad you've got everything bass akwards.  Oh man, I love this forum. Trump has been kickin' ass for 18 months, and you still haven't figured out HE is da man.  You're still squealing  and hissy fitting. Get over it. You lost. He is the POTUS, and you need to get on board.
"
0,"One of the most worrisome aspects of this decision is that when you read Trump's speech and his alleged justifications for withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement it's clear he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. As with so much of what he says, the speech is filled with multiple statements that are blatantly false.  You can't help but worry that if he is this misinformed about something as basic as climate science, then what kind of critical analysis will he use on more complicated problems?  A couple more years of decisions like this and we better all start learning Chinese. If our country refuses to look toward the future, the Chinese have shown that they are very eager to become the world economic leader in low carbon technologies.

Apparently, they even believe that there are millions of Muslims who have radicalized to the point that they want death to America. As a result, these 39% live in fear of and hate Muslims, even though their fears are not supported by facts.  See how it works?  I suggest we all go out of our way and make friends with a Muslim and Mexican, for that matter. The best way to compact this fear is to face it in the face.

And the two real candidates are discussing these very problems...jobs, the economy, taxes, climate change, energy...and the dreck on the fringes of the right are trying to do what?  The guns, God, gays, guts, glory doesn't sell very well when nothing is done...of course for those who like absolutist, there's Trump, who pulled the curtain aside to show there's no one behind the curtain.

0,"Opinions cannot be debunked.  For example, if the state department does not have documentation as to where $6 billion went, in my opinion they lost it.  Government is all about documentation.  If there is no documentation as to where the money went in detail, then Trump was correct is criticizing the operation and it is reasonable to say the money was lost if records regarding its disposition where lost.  Trump's comment on Putin is correct in my opinion.  The two men have probably shared at most a few words in formal situations.  I think it is likely that Trump does not know Putin in any personal sense.  This is my opinion and past Trump comments regarding Putin's public face do not mean to me that Trump knows him.  The undocumented labor claim actually pisses me off.  Trump is a developer not a contractor.  He hired a contractor who may or may not have used undocumented workers.  But bottom line, the developer does not micromanage a contractor.  All opinions.

In fact, if we are to believe the Bernie Sanders faithful, she is basically a Republican.  At least that's what they all tell me when I blog about the election.  I have been called a DINO, a sell-out, a Republican (gasp), because I dare support her over Bernie Sanders.  Did I mention I consider myself a liberal Democrat.  If we are to truly stop Donald Trump from sending us over a cliff, at least consider voting for Clinton.

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a """"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,"""" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?

0,"Donald Trump is a good golfer. That is a fact. Barack Obama is a good singer. That's another fact, and about as relevant when gauging the effectiveness of a president.  To make the Trump/golf connection relevant, consider these two tidbits:  1. When asked about efforts to broaden the appeal of golf, Trump replied - """"Let golf be elitist. When I say """"aspire,"""" that’s a positive word. Let people work hard and aspire to some day be able to play golf. To afford to play it. They’re trying to teach golf to people who will never be able to really play it.""""  It's hard not to wonder what the Trump base of white, working class, less well educated Americans would make of this statement. He really believes they don't deserve to play the sport he loves.  2. The famously anti-global warming Trump, who has stated that it's all a hoax created by the Chinese, sited global warming as a reason to build a seawall around one of his courses in Ireland.

However, because of the very short time available to prepare this cost estimate, quantifying and incorporating those macroeconomic effects have not been practicable.

Trump had to have known the  uproar and firestorm of negative press that this would generate for him, right in the middle of several other controversies in which he is simultaneously involved.  He doesn't have nearly the political capital or goodwill towards him and his administration needed to implement this sort of a dramatic reversal in policy. The entire rest of his agenda is in jeopardy now because of his extremely bad timing, and I fully expect this order to be fought by activist 9th Circuit judges and denounced by liberal Democrats everywhere, who will no doubt add it to the list of things for which they feel he deserves to be impeached.

Obviously, it's Trump's attempt to deflect from the ongoing investigation of his corrupt administration, criminal activities related to his campaign, his overall incompetence, and his failure to adequately prepare  for, and fast action to protect the people of Puerto Rico -- even congratulating himself for a """"great job.""""

He has been divorced twice and married three times, he makes money off of gambling, he has boasted about his sexual conquests, he routinely denigrates women, and before he started campaigning, the only time he ever entered a church was to get out of the rain or duck a subpoena process server. But, he doesn't drink alcoholic drinks and will throw GLBT people under the bus whenever he needs to, so religious conservatives swoon.

As Trump's campaign is seriously lacking funding since he said he did not need any donors to answer to it appears that Trump's handlers are on a different mission to fund that campaign and do it now. Trump needs Pence to go beg for money. When Trump announced the VP he let Pence hang around in the background and barely noted him. Obvious Trump is a total one man show. This will be interesting to watch to see if Trump will at least try to be better at male bonding with Pence or will Pence be on a never ending mission to raise cash and tell the donors not to be concerned about Trump and all the voters he has alienated, he can fix it.

0,"You are using statistics incorrectly. Some 39% of the popular vote went Liberals. True, that may have constituted only 27% of potential voters because of a 68% voter turnout, but you are wrong to reach the conclusion that  lowering voter turnout (the popular vote) decreases someone's share of the popular vote.  Much as we would like to see it closer to 100%, the 68% turnout is almost certainly a solid sampling of Canadians' electoral preference. Therefore it is safe to say that at least 39% of Canadians support the election of a Liberal government. Pre-election polling showed that a high proportion of the 20% who voted New Democrat would relatively easily vote Liberal as a second choice. Add some of the Greens and Bloc, and one can safely conclude that more than 50% of Canadians support a Liberal government.  In the U.S. election, I understand that droves stayed away because of dislike for either candidate. So I doubt Trump envies Trudeau's power, but he must envy his popularity.

When people feel sufficiently diminished, reduced, they lash out in anger against the people who make them feel this way, as well as at other available targets. I agree that this is destructive, even unjustifiable, but it is understandable, comprehensible. If we're going to work things out democratically, we will have to take these feelings seriously and we will have to address them. And there there will have to be some level of mutual respect among us. I think Joan Williams gets this right.

And I think for us to use that time for some reflection, to give thanks to those who participated, is entirely appropriate, and that’s what’s been taking place.”  Biden and Bill Clinton laud the president. I'm not so naive that I think they did it without Obama's assent, but it's a far more modest approach than Trump would use.  I certainly misunderstood your position.

It is one thing for a President (i.e. the personification of the executive branch of the US Federal Government) to pardon a conviction for an offence against some enactment (i.e. against a law enacted by the executive & legislative branches of government) but quite another to override a court (i.e. representing the judicial branch) that had acted within its inherent jurisdiction to protect that jurisdiction.

Cultural """"diversity"""" is not always a good thing, as the practice of some cultures involve denying rights to others based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, etc. some cultures still believe in human sacrifice.

This would lead to a perpetuation of war in the Middle East which would be bad for US security interests and therefore should be opposed by those loyal to the USA.  Finally, the deal Obama made with Iran made it more difficult for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and was therefore good for the USA and our many allies who signed the deal.

Then, yesterday he casually cited that project as a fine example of the close cooperation between the US and Canada and a harbinger of further cooperation.  Thus, Canadians shouldn't take Trump's reference to only 'tweaking NAFTA' as an indication that US-Canada trade dealings will be relatively smooth or governed by the rule of law.  A better prediction is that the US will demand special advantages, regardless of the terms of NAFTA, whenever their Federal Government has some leverage that can be applied before a project with binational aspects can move forward as routinely anticipated.  Canada and Canadians must be prepared to resist intellegently as cases of bullying arise and, in partiucular, not remain silent and pretend this is acceptable.

0,"This is the shame of the republican party.  Most educated republicans know the basic science and and accept the conclusion that increasing levels of CO2 are affecting our climate will will continue to do at an increasing pace.  They understand that the negative impacts of climate change will be a 'threat multiplier' for the growth of worldwide instability and terrorism.  They already know this.  But for purely political reasons they have allowed special interests to own the narrative on this, to drive the party's politics.  Hey republicans!  Want to start to collaborate with democrats in accomplishing important legislation?  In solving real problems?  Start here.  How about it Lisa?  If you will come out conclusively, no weasel words, and clearly state the truth, then reach out to others to positively address this, you'll get my vote.

0,"He shouldn't be subject to the revised travel ban. Basically the Supreme Court rewrote it for Trump so it would pass constitutional muster by saying anyone from the six countries with a valid connection to the U.S., such as a relative, a school, or a job would not be affected. But I understand his comment about the uncertainty and can't say he's not doing the right thing. By the way, remember that not a single terrorist attack has been carried out by a citizen from any of the six countries the ban applies to. Fifteen of the 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and they are still welcome to send more.

So, what is the purpose of the alternative minimum tax?  Here is a pretty good explanation, from Turbo Tax -  """"The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was designed to keep wealthy taxpayers from using loopholes to avoid paying taxes. But because it was not automatically updated for inflation, more middle-class taxpayers were getting hit with the AMT each year. Congress traditionally passed an annual """"patch"""" to address this until, in January 2013, they passed a permanent patch to the AMT.""""  - https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/irs-tax-return/alternative-minimum-tax-common-questions/L50YotKHP.

With insurers now permitted to charge older people as much as five times what they charge younger individuals — instead of three times or more under Obamacare — older Americans see their premiums soar. What’s more, the AHCA’s tax credits for many older people are less generous than the ACA’s were, so they have less help with payments."""" https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/05/05/who-gets-hurt-and-when-if-trumpcare-becomes-law/?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.7454f39cde05

Hours after locking up the Republican presidential nomination this week, tRump suggested that defaulting on the national debt could be a good thing. Economists and financial observers pointed out that his proposal to buy back U.S. debts for less than what America borrowed would send interest rates soaring and cripple the dollar’s vital status as the world’s safest investment. Pressed to explain why he thinks a huge national lender like China would accept a loss on their investment in the United States on Sunday, tRump offered only a verbal shrug. “You never know,” he told ABC’s George Stephanopoulous. “At some point, they might want to get out.

Despite the entire U.S. chain of command listening to hours of back channel calls for help BEFORE the ship was towed into Won Son, zero help was provided.

If you catch an actor with a hooker, it’s front page news, but if I’m caught smoking crack with a hooker, I’m some sort of hero. It’s like, ‘Yeah! Alright, Kid Rock!’”  There's more, look them up, but none of them are fit to print in a family newspaper.  He's one gutter mouthed egoist who does a lot of bragging and saying obscene things about women.  Another sexual predator like Trump.  What is it with conservatives and their neurotic hang-ups with sex?  They put on a show of being the 'values' people, but scratch that surface and all kinds of perversions rise to the fore. No different here.  Robert Richie is one sick puppy.

Not even Congress handles this well-- I think this is as much Trump's fault as Congress'. What we should have are congressional hearing on this from the insurance companies, doctors, hospitals, economists, and others. One thing you never see is that one of the reasons the market has gotten screwed up is that Insurers are not getting the temporary subsidies called for by the law-- and one reason for this is that a Republican (Marco Rubio) added a measure that requires that insurers sue to get the subsidies they are entitled to.

The merger of the presidency with the Trump corporate empire and with the Trump family is especially troubling. As for Republican opposition to Trump: over the course of the 2016 campaign, Republican opposition fluctuated between tepid and impotent, with a huge share of cowardice. In the end, they all caved.

The US Army and Air Force can airlift supplies, people, water, and generators to foreign countries devastated by earthquakes and floods. Why can't they do that with Puerto Rico? The Air Force is capable of creating emergency control towers. And now Trump Tweets that the Puerto Ricans always want hand-outs. He didn't whine about Texans and Floridians who needed disaster assistance whining about handouts after Irma. Maybe it's because TX and FL have electoral votes? All those companies who sent workers to FL to restore their electrical network: Why can't those same workers be flown from Miami to PR? Trump is showing his true colors.

It's trying not be cruel to people who are desperate and poor enough to try a risky border crossing, without encouraging more to try. Not an easy balance.  There is no contradiction between caring for and supporting Canadians with mental health or other issues, and caring about people trying to cross the border to get away from Trump. As the article notes, however, the large majority of those who cross are sent back to the US.  So Canada's finances and social safety nets are not threatened by people walking across our borders.

Everything is about size with Trump, size of his hands, size of his junk, size of the crowds at the inauguration. It bothers him to no end. It’s all about him being the best, being number one, him being at center stage towering over his opponents. Instead of focusing on the job at hand, after all he is President, he won the election. He continues as if he is still on the campaign trail. The other day even in front of the CIA wall of honour for fallen CIA agents he continued to whine and boast about the size of his crowd and the awful media.

Some practices are worse than others. Again, spits?! 4. Unless we refuse to have anything to do with any of them, we will be tainted by association. Foreign relations  makes for strange bedfellows. 5. The moral conflict between ideals and reality has a lot to do with the mental and emotional issues soldiers have when they return from these engagements. 6.

How will the Republicans ever recover from their almost wholesale support of Donald Trump? -I don't believe they can. And to my mind, that itself is cause for celebration, because the Republican Party today, although it may pander to the uneducated, working class voter, is really the party of robber barons, faceless corporations, and the privileged 1%.

When a nutjob like Trump gets elected Congress can, had does assert itself (e.g. Russian probe, Russian sanctions, ObamaCare, etc.).  I would not rule Trump out. If Dems get majorities in Congress I would expect Trump to push through an infrastructure package, tax reform and other items that Dems can get behind.

This is why I bemoaned the fact that the Democrats and the press were focusing on Trump's sexual peccadilloes - which are irrelevant to his ability to lead - rather than his complete lack of experience, impulsive behavior, bizarre pronouncements, shady business background, and penchant for blatant lies... yes, those things were all addressed, but the misogyny card was overplayed. I suppose that was inevitable given that Clinton was running primarily on her gender.

We don't know these peoples' situations. We are taking them in, assessing matters and then will decide. In a civilized manner. As we have always done.  There are more than we're used to, the USA is more volatile than usual and we have our own hatemongers stirring fear of invasion.  Let's calm down and deal with the problem without the hysteria.

And, so, the final stage begins.  Those that matter, the Congress, is ignoring him or shrugging off his threats (Ryan AND Schumer are both dismissing his """"fund the Wall or shutdown"""" threat).  The public takes nothing he says seriously.  Except, bascially, for the """"entertainment value"""" (for lack of a better term).  The substance of what he says is being ignored and written off by the public (except for his co-dependent base members, loving the hate and very thinly veiled racism).

Apparently she had an 85% success rate in her predictions. One thing she predicted which caught my attention was the rise of the """"White Brotherhood"""" in Russia, later spreading throughout the world. Since Russia is seen by some as the ancient ancestral home of the Aryans (Hitler's feeling that that distinction belonged to Germany notwithstanding) that made the few hairs on my head stand on end. This is especially relevant since many white supremacists apparently view Putin's Russia with awe as a white bulwark against the creeping Muslim """"invasion"""" from the south. Sound familiar?

There's nothing wrong with doing things legally and everything right by it.  This isn't a negative. It's a positive. We are a pro-immigrant country and I think that President Trump is simply saying we need to do it legally. Additionally, he must.  Article II of the Constitution states that the President is responsible for the execution and enforcement of the laws created by Congress -- ergo immigration laws or protecting from invasion as under Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, """"The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against invasion"""".

Not long after Obama became president, he announced a plan to allow dreamers to remain permanently in the U.S. as legal residents and he urged Congress to pass such legislation because, by his own admission, he did not have the authority to do it.  Legislation was introduced, but Congress refused to pass it.  Obama then followed through with his threat to do with his pen what Congress would not do.  He issued an Executive Order creating the DACA program which made or changed immigration law, which he was not authorized to do.  That is the problem. Law suits challenging the EO have been filed and are working their way through the court system where I believe the EO ultimately will be ruled unconstitutional.  Trump is right for allowing DACA to end and letting Congress decide the matter.

His lawyers and accountants were good enough to leverage the banks so he didn't totally go under years ago. Why has he still not released his tax returns? Because he's hiding something that will show that he is not as successful as he claims to be. He has almost completed projects over budget and some of them have gone bust. And you want to talk about his lying wife who claimed she had a degree in architecture and then plagiarized her speech from Michelle Obama? His wife is nothing more than a gold digger.

0,"Hawaii doesn't have any financial issues whatsoever. The rail is under budget (Instead of 3.2 Billion I believe it's more like 2.5 Billion)  and ahead of schedule; it just isn't being reported. The cars look great. The trip from Kapolei to Ala Moana takes under 30 minutes, beating all those on the freeway. The new bicycle racks on top of the train are totally full, so the riders are not having any issues navigating the city (instead of using gas guzzling taxis or buses).  The latest trend for rail riders is black Nehru jackets and matching pants; quite a sight as they crisscross the city.  The good news is there are a few extra seats on the train. Obviously the judge realizes that  because Hillary isn't the President, we must oppose any attempt by Trump to temporarily stop people from visiting from countries like Somalia. They have a right to ride the train; preventing them from visiting Hawaii is pure discrimination.

0,"The economic relationship that has developed within NAFTA has been one of mutual advantage. It has evolved as a free competitive market and bears all the hallmarks of efficiency that Adam Smith would expect. Nobody has been coerced, so deals have been made only when both parties benefit.  Often in economics we discuss efficiency, and as a counterpoint we bring up the notion of equity, or fairness. Efficiency and fairness are two separate outcomes, and you rarely get one without sacrificing the other.  If Trump wants fairness (whatever that means!), he's going to have to sacrifice efficiency, which will reduce the wealth and well-being of all the NAFTA trading partners. Trump (among others) needs to understand more of economics. When the government interferes in markets and distorts prices, there are very seldom good outcomes, and never efficient ones . Also, what makes sense in profit oriented business in the micro scale tends to have disastrous consequences in the macro economy.

When he realized what was happening, he cut his vacation short and flew back to d.c., directing air force one to fly over the devastation.  The picture taken of him peering out the window made him seem """"detached and uncaring.""""  His approval rating plummeted and never recovered, even though much of the blame for the poor response belonged to fema.

0,"Obama has left the US in a better situation than when he became President For example the US now had 80 straight months of economic expansion, The US is currently enjoying the longest period of private sector job creation in US history. US jobless claims hit a 43-year low . Unemployment claims are below 300,000 for 89 straight weeks — the longest run since 1970 and an indicator of a healthy labor market. Unemployment is 4.6%, The stock market continues to set new record highs since President Obama took office. For 95% of American taxpayers, income taxes are as low or lower than they were at almost any point in the last 50 years. Since Obama became president, the US economy has gone from losing 750,000 jobs per month (under Bush)  to adding 250,000 jobs per month. That’s a net improvement under Obama of about 1 million jobs per month, I wish Trump the best of luck and hope he can maintain the progress the US has made in the past 8 years.

0,"You just noted that Syria was so chaotic (a very mild term for the place), that this chaos, and the threat it posed to American citizens, was the reason behind Obama's temporary immigration restriction actions.   The 6 other nations on Obama's list are also chaotic hotbeds of people who have stated they hate the West and want to kill Westerners for the sake of their religion.  So I don't understand how Obama's temporary ban is justified, while Trump's temporary can be said to be born out nothing but bigotry and pure hatred.  Both presidents operate in an era where Muslim terrorism is a fact.   Both recognize 7 nations where this terrorism is prevalent.   Neither of us likely has info for an informed opinion whether those visas assured proper vetting.   There are some matters that we have to trust to elected officials and intelligence agencies.  A president's #1 job is protecting American citizens, and given ISIS it's very difficult.  They are due their power to make bans.

This loudmouth yelling plays well to the meathead faction in America, but it accomplishes nothing, increases world anxiety, and holds the threat of actual military action, which isn't necessary.  Except by diplomacy including economic sanctions, nothing can be done to stop Kim from acquiring nuclear ICBMs in the next decade. Would he use them, knowing his nation would be obliterated? Why, I ask?  Pakistan, a chaotic nation, has nukes and hates India, which also has nukes. Have they used them? No, because they understand the consequences.  As several on this forum have pointed out, we ought to hold out a carrot to NK, inclusion in trade with the West. Peace would follow.

0,"This first post is to show who really had a majority of votes in 49 out 50 states and DC.  It is true certified votes in California gave Hillary Clinton 8,753,788 votes and Donald Trump 4,483,810 votes giving her a margin of +4,269,978 for California only. California is a sanctuary state with an estimated 7 - 8 million illegal immigrants and another 3 million legal immigrants, most who can get California Drivers licenses legally - the ID required to register and to vote. But suppose we take the other 49 states and DC and exclude California, Hillary Clinton got 65,844,954 - 8,753,788 = 57,091,166 votes and Donald Trump got 62,979,879 - 4,483,810 = 58,496,069 votes. So for the other 49 states and DC Donald Trump won that popular vote by 58,496,069 - 57,091,166 = +1,404,903 votes.   That is why we have had the electoral college in place for over 200 years so one or two heavily populated states alone cannot pick a president.

0,"I believe that our elected officials need to get real with the actual costs associated with rail and be honest with the taxpayers of the state on whether we can actually afford the cost.  10 billion dollars is a huge cost considering that much of the infrastructure of the state is in a critical state ... the sewers, roads, water pipes ... etc.  To put the cost in perspective ... on the low end the cost to build the Trump border is 10 billion dollars ... but that cost would be absorbed by the entire country.  In addition, the government needs to be honest about the costs associated with running rail.  How will that be subsidized?  Raising property tax, public parking, taxes, the cost of other public transportation like the bus, handi vans, low income housing.  That will result in more homeless ... for people just making it by.  Our leaders need to get honest and real fast because there are real consequences to the decisions that are be made now.

Trump has been lathering Putin with praise, entertaining Putin's friends in the Oval Office, and wants to give the Russians back houses in the US they were using to conduct spying operations from.  He's great friends with XI (it would be inappropriate to call China a currency manipulator), ever since China started approving Trump trademarks and """"promised"""" to carry water with North Korea (which is obviously happening since NK isn't firing test missiles EVERY DAY, only a couple times a month).  Would be at least palatable if he were """"nasty, mean and rude"""" to Putin and Xi.

So, generally speaking, about back-channel communications, what that allows you to do is to communicate in a discreet manner.” He said further that he was not concerned abut Kushner's actions.  Why would Russia want Trump to be president when they had a better opportunity to increase their global position under a Clinton presidency. In 2010 HRC and 9 other Federal Agency heads of the Obama administration did not object to Russia acquiring a majority financial interest in Uranium One - it owns it completely now. Shortly afterwards, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.  The Podesta Group (owned by brother of John Podesta) lobbied for the deal.  I wonder what Obama meant when caught on a hot mike just prior to the 2012 election telling Putin """"I'll have more flexibility after the election.

Lots of the big players on the right wing sites have been strongly opposed to Trump's foreign policy and especially his attack on Syria. People like Ann Coulter (who wrote the book """"In Trump we Trust""""), Yiannopoules, Laura Ingraham, Paul Watson, and others. I think Trump is working well with China and their backing of Trump vs N. Korea is very clear. For this, Trump dropped some of his trade demands, and most importantly said China was not manipulating its currency.

We constantly hear from liberals about the so called seriousness of sexual harassment and other disgusting sexual conduct and how it can't be tolerated.

If you see a wrong, take constructive, positive action to correct it. Saying that you will not honor the symbol of what's good about America is a worthless solution.  The flag stands for freedom and justice, and it stands for a country that fought and passed laws to protect everyone's rights.  If the application of those laws hasn't been implemented perfectly, quit your shallow indignation and work positively to help our country get better. I will definitely stop watching the NFL. America has its problems, but because a minute handful of rogue policemen acted wrongly does not necessitate dishonoring our national symbol. Elway-get a backbone or lose supporters.

After WWII it was said in Europe's Capitals that America is so rich that Europe could live well on its throwaways, and Asia is so poor that it could survive on Europe's refuse.  Today Asia sits on a pile of cash, geriatric Europe ekes out existence childless, and here we are under a mound of debt.

0,"""""All illegal aliens should be treated equally, should they not?""""  No, they shouldn't. We cannot afford, nor will we ever, deport all those here illegally. Therefore, we have to make choices about where to focus these limited resources. That is what President Obama did with his executive order, set enforcement priorities. You see, it doesn't really make sense to spend those resources upending the lives of kids who are working hard and are the most likely of immigrants to be successful in America; and instead spend those resources on deporting criminals, of which Obama did plenty. President Trump, with his order, shows that he has no understanding of something as basic as allocation of assets. He's not able to focus either his mind or his administration, which is why he gets no results.

0,"US spending is currently 4.4% of GDP. Russia's is a guesstimate, by anyone's guess.  We should spend smarter: We should produce as much as we possibly can for our own needs, domestically. I know military spending is a relatively poor job creator, but if there are any jobs to be made, they should be made in Canada. Else, we should prefer to buy arms from countries that """"have our backs""""; from our allies and """"like minded nations"""". I would like to see a deprecation of spending on US-made arms, in favour of other arms producing countries with advanced gear, including France, England, Germany, Sweden, and increasingly also India which has some impressive mil.gear too.  If Trump feels he can create jobs in the US by making US allies uncomfortable; Trump should be made to understand the benefits won't accrue to him for doing so. NB: US's out-sized role in the world, and huge mil budget was US's choice, 'State Spending' to subsidize def-contractors, who subsidize political campaigns.

Why is Trump wanting to ease the sanctions, and allow them back into their compounds?  Let's say for argument sake that Obama didn't do everything he could.  Fine.  However........  Collusion or no collusion.....that isn't the question here.  Obama did do something about it after the election.  Why doesn't Trump seem to care?  Why is he easing sanctions on Russia (both with regards to the election and Ukraine) without getting anything in return?

0,"I wouldn't stay up waiting on impeachment.  How many Republicans thought they had Bill Clinton over a barrel and dead to rights, and yet he managed to limp out a full 8 year double term to its conclusion, and this despite ongoing hearings, national coverage for his depositions, etc.? If the US public and even outright political opponents cannot hold one Clinton to affairs and shady land deals and another Clinton to knowingly violating security protocols while Secretary of State, then the odds are good that Trump won't be impeached, either. It's far more likely that he'll be a one term president, but they are stuck with him for the next four years.

I do not believe the people who were in the vehicle, including Mrs. Johnson, are saying what they actually heard, but instead are regurgitating Congresswoman’s Wilson spin.

Paul Roderick Gregory, a pro-Russian, anti-American """"economist"""": “The Trump Dossier Is Fake -- And Here Are The Reasons Why.” Gregory is, to be kind, a Russian stooge. His article is Russian disinformation without substance. Drop me a line if would like more details.  """"Unverified"""" is a neutral term. """"Verified"""" is positive.

But Bannon and Trump concocted a story that him and Trump are on the outs and got Fox News to take the lead on spinning this story out to the world.  By distributing this story, the media is doing EXACTLY what Trump and Bannon have planned and they are undoubtedly laughing to themselves about how they got everybody to buy into this fake news story.  Look at Bannon's past remarks and look at how Trump has publicly reacted to Charlottesville. Bannon has said repeatedly that he wishes to completely destroy the establishment, why in the world would anybody come out with a supportive statement of white supremacy, then denounce it, then come out in support again?

Flynn was knee deep with Trump and if he flips on Trump, his son and son in law, don't think Trump will even make 4 years.  With Trump threatening to fire Mueller, that has probably greatly stepped up Mueller's time table for his investigation and to release his findings.   To think that once he became President of the United States, put aside his arrogance and gained some humility to lead the country, Trump's legacy would have rivaled Ronald Reagan.  Instead the chain of events that started with the arrogant firing of Comey has snowballed into an independent investigation by Mueller that is now backed by BOTH Demos and Repubs in Congress, which will bring about his and his family's downfall as well.  Mueller has flipped Flynn AND has access to Trump's financials including all of his tax returns.  Impeachment proceedings would be welcomed over any charges of fraud against the IRS.

While the left and media are doing their best to tear a rift between Russia and the US, you can better believe that China is loving it.  Having a Russian ally during a confrontation with China could assist greatly.  Instead, we are still flailing in the Middle East militarily.  Besides, even IF the Trump administration was developing a sharp response to China, it would be leaked out and undercut by telling them what was coming.

I don't consider a President who wants a health insurance system that gives the people the right to choose a program that fits their needs and not what the government is forcing on them. And doesn't support a tax system where a small minority is responsible to pay for the spending of our nation. Trump is giving a voice back to individual American citizen, and that is what is upsetting the big government nanny state supporter.

Politics is a popularity contest.

You have that with Ms. Ambrose.  If not, then someone like her.  A successful, articulate, experienced, pragmatic and telegenic woman of intellectual substance.  To beat Boy Wonder in the hair and nail salons of Canada, while at the same time capturing the attention of the average working stiff (either gender) you need something that will sell.  Angry, grey, humorless, inflexible ain't going to do it. Is there anyone left in charge that gets this reality, or has the party been taken over by troglodytes?

This problem was created by the Legislative Branch, with both democrats and republicans to blame for creating the laws that have criminalized pot. It started with the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act which was later found unconstitutional and then again made illegal with the Controlled Substances Act in the 70s.  I believe that it is an abuse of power when/if the Executive Branch can pick-and-chose which laws to enforce.  I also believe that the Legislative Branch should repeal the Controlled Substances Act.  If people are foolish enough to want to be a pot head and provided they are not on any form of public assistance, I believe that the government has no business being involved in that decision.

It’s not much better for the GOP. The real legislative problem here is on the Republican side. This triggers as significant intra-party fight under duress.

He is a serial adulterer, alleged sexual abuser and thrice married former casino operator, yet to conservative evangelical voters he is a hero and a rightous man of god. His election proves once and for all that American conservative Christianity is a hypocritical farce and a sham.

Donald Trump has shown himself to be a lying sleazebag that is unfit to be in office. He doesn't read books or his reports. He demands that his intelligence briefings be reduced to nine bullet points per page. Anymore and he will refuse to read the briefing.

Reality is the standard of living in Fbks was better with gold dollars than either petro dollars or Govt dollars floating around .  These huge mines are held under such tight scrutiny that they can properly develope the mine . I get a real laugh out of the people out a Kotzebue complaining about the pollution from the red dog mine . Are you kidding , the zinc has been blowing around out there for millions of years .

0,"Reflecting on Presidents you have never met and saying they are better than Trump? How do you even know this?  Lincoln, Roosevelt and Kennedy were all massively hated by many at the times of their election and after.  Nearly half the USA was against Lincoln.  Kennedy was possibly hated by many more than Trump is (he was shot).  It is pretty easy to say someone is great after over time their actions seem better and more noble than when it actually happened.  You have no idea what will happen in Trumps 4 years and what kind of legacy he will have.  Just because most people have no answer to him other than to hate him and protest anything he does, won't mean he won't be considered a great president some day.  In what way do you have any clue what these old presidents were really like?

There are MANY things that both that song and the flag represent, and a person taking issue with one of those things isn't necessarily taking issue with all.  If you want to see true disrespect of the country, just look to the White House.  Trump aggressively avoided military service.  Simply put, he's a draft dodger.  He also spoke out against our Constitutional rights, which is subversion.  If you are willing to support someone who wants to condemn and punish those exercising their Constitutional rights, then you might as well throw the American flag in with all of the Broncos stuff you're disposing of, because the Constitution IS our country.

On November 8th, election day,  the Dow was at 18,332. 10% of that days DOW would be 1,832 points. 18,332 and 1,832 is 20,164.  The DOW was at 19,961 on December 23 which is not a 10% increase; it is an 8.8%. Perhaps to Trump 10% and 8.8% are nearly the same but to those who invest its is not. Now Donald can pick what ever day he wants to tweet the DOW increases as representing his success. So I ask Donald to make sure he tweets the world when the DOW declines and take credit for those results as well.  Bye he way Donald when Obama was elected the DOW was at 8,693. It was 18,332 on this past election day.  That is nearly a 10,000 point increase in the DOW during Obama's time in office; over 100% increase.

I look at the nominees under review for positions in the new administration and question why so many just can not put together the required financial disclosures before their hearing.  I wonder why so many positions in this administration have not had anyone appointed that requires no congressional approval.

Monsanto put a lot of money into their adds and as bad as this sounds the fate of everyone lied in the gullibility of the 2nd district to believe that everyone would lose their homes and businessnesses and go bankrupt if they didn't allow Monsanto and chemicals rule their land.

And if not assaulted, how is that evidence that others haven't been? Ms Nelson and all of us have a right to consider the serious evidence there is without being dismissed as politically motivated.  The argument that we have to forgive Trump as a fellow sinner is irrelevant to whether one deems him fit to be POTUS. The reasons for placing anyone in responsibility depend on a person's qualities and stances—not on Christian forgiveness.  By this reasoning, we'd have to put a child molester in charge of a daycare if he repented.  Despite your assumptions and objections that others are being political, you write as a partisan supporter of Trump. You're openly opposed to the Clintons despite their being """"imperfect sinners in need of God's grace like the rest of us.""""

He played to most base emotions in his audience and they responded in monstrous, uproarious fashion. Look at the people he has chosen for his cabinet and as his top advisors. He refuses to do the PDB's in favor of getting his info from a disgraced General who traffics in the most over the top conspiracy theories. Only thing I can credit trump with so far is that he seems to be open to getting some information from Elon Musk. Probably because Peter Thiel has long been a trump supporter and the two of them invented PayPal before going their separate ways. I will not forget what I saw and heard of trump and via vigilant effort now what he is doing to set himself up in DC. He is bad news for the nation without a doubt.

0,"The reason why Flynn had to go was because he lost the confidence of Donald Trump, not because of his communication with the Russians (as Obama did the same thing), but because he didn't tell the truth when asked about it. I agree with his removal. But the real damage of this incident is the fact that someone in the intelligence community is leaking classified top secret information to the media. This is unacceptable and Donald Trump needs to initiate an investigation as to who these people are and their motives for committing these treasonous actions.

I'm making no assertion here about who the bigger creepy slimeball actually was and I made no assertion that either was a creepy slimeball. That's why I capitalized PERCIEVED.

What Trump fails to give notice to is how repatriating all this to the US is going to affect production costs and thus consumer costs in the US. As for Canada, just stay quiet, throw up softwood lumber and mobility of services as the big complaints we have, and likely nothing major will happen to us and who knows, something may be improved.

How has the investor-state dispute settlement process served Canadian interests to date? Even with NAFTA in place, the U.S. has almost always acted to serve its own interests. Further, NAFTA hasn't curbed American state subsidies and I don't believe a Canadian firm has ever been able to successfully sue a U.S. government under the protections that supposedly exist under NAFTA. Reverting to the FTA might not be such a bad thing, although Mexico would get sideswiped. In order to allow Mexico into the arrangement, however, it would have to prove that it's willing to in good faith abide by common labour and environmental standards. Its behavior hasn't been entirely virtuous in these matters.

And to pour billions of more dollars into a military industrial complex that is not keeping us safe, and a border wall that will be a mockery of our values and a symbol of hate.

Iraq citizens could be better vetted as well as the USA had been there for 10 plus years and could query the validity of citizens to a database that had been established. There is no database yet established in the countries he banned making a proper vetting unattainable at this time. All of this has been backed up by several leaders of departments in the USA including FBI. This cannot be done in trumps banned states. The vetting process in those states would be a farce and should make us in canada think twice. The only history we can look up of citizens of Syria is what little to no info the Syrian government has records of.

The yahoos at his rallies wearing those disgusting shirts were certainly the minority, and their vitriol wasn't solely aimed at her -- the noose, journalist, some assembly required shirt was the most offensive one I saw.

The interesting thing is that Scalia was dead, so Simmons was literally beating a dead horse and could not excuse it by claiming there was a need to influence public opinion.  Simmons' screed against Scalia was pure hate with no redeeming social value.  And with Trump, everyone knows that there is absolutely no possibility that Trump could get Hawaii's four votes in the electoral college.  So what's the point of Simmons repeatedly trashing Trump?  Very few people outside Hawaii read Honolulu Civil Beat, and people inside Hawaii will be voting overwhelmingly for Clinton.  Maybe Simmons simply feels a need to scream, to vent, to preach to the choir -- and most of all a need to justify the megabucks Omidyar is paying him.

0,"The Ninth Circuit decision will be overturned by the SC. Eighty percent of their cases are.  From the Washington Post: By accepting the use of preelection statements to impeach and limit executive policy, the 9th Circuit is taking a dangerous step. The states’ argument is in essence that Trump is a bigot, and thus his winning presidential campaign in fact impeaches him from exercising key constitutional and statutory powers, such as administering the immigration laws.  The opinions clause in the Constitution is a protection for free speech. Candidates Left, Right and Center will chill their campaigns if this is allowed to stand.

He has set a time bomb since the mandates are essential to the funding of the ACA. Trump. Ryan and the rest of the Republican crowd lied every time they repeated the mantra """"Repeal and Replace.""""  They are determined to harm poor, sick, and elderly people -- and there is no doubt that they will do it. Even as I type this post, Trump is on TV lying through his teeth.

0,"Some of the Trump's hopes for an updated NAFTA should be non-starters:  1) Elimination of the dispute resolution mechanism. Rather than elimination, this needs to be strengthened and the timeline to decisions shortened because US corporations can use duties and tariffs as an economic weapon to weaken their rivals, even when facing fair and open competition. The softwood dispute is a perfect example. 2) Currency manipulation. If it becomes part of a new NAFTA, US corporations could use this, in combination with the loss of a dispute resolution mechanism, as another weapon to defeat rivals rather than a means to seek a level playing field. 3) 'Buy American', but American firms get access to municipal, provincial and federal procurements. Possibly something to be bartered away during negotiations. But Trump might actually think this is a realistic and 'fair' demand in exchange for access to the US market.  I'd like to see a fulsome discussion of US agricultural subsidies in our media.

This is clearly absurd, since nobody is stopping Trump's critics from making their often unfair and over-the-top criticisms. Obviously, these critics, many of whom sound spoiled and sheltered from reality, have no real understanding of what living under true dictatorships is like. At the same time, some anti-Trump critics are extremely intolerant of anyone who does not share their political views, or even those who don't object to Trump vigorously enough for their liking.

Choosing to talk about the Party that will remain when Trump's influence is (hopefully) gone.  I know you recognize Trump is merely a Pres. candidate and a political Party is bigger than that single job, and encompasses a multitude of opinions and positions (you do, right?), and thus that there are a multitude of reasons to speak to Party members about the issues and positions, local, state, and Federal, which exist whomever the nominee may be.

Why wouldn't he want to get the full story out in the open where the possibility of a hostile foreign regime may have interfered with the most elemental basis of the US nation, its democratic process?  What is he afraid of?  What is he hiding?  Trump attacking the CIA for bringing forth strategically critical information?  Methinks Trump dost protest too much.

If Trump manages to negotiate real improvements to the ACA that will be a very good thing he will have done.

The democrats have used this logic in the past, and it just goes to their extreme hypocrisy to continue to snivel about it now.  It's been going on for a long time.  To keep drudging it up to somehow denigrate the current president's choice is disingenuous at best.  Trump isn't responsible for the actions of the Senate under obama anymore than you or I.  The only individual who would be acceptable to the democrats would be a left winger, wanting to violate his oath TO the Constitution, by legislating from the bench.  That's not going to happen.

0,"You are partly right. Our objectives have been and are being laid out clearly and candidly by Trump's advisers without sweetening up. The generals who have served in Afghanistan-- and just a day ago by Secretary State Tillerson. We are not going to win this on the battlefield or by building a government and nation. We want to keep the government from being overrun tomorrow and the Taliban from taking more territory and get the parties to a negotiated settlement that Trump's people have coneeded will probably include the Taliban. Even with 50,000 or even 100,000 troops a battlefield or military victory is not possible. Like Tillerson says-- our objective is to keep the Taliban from winning on the battlefield.

As Canadians, who are we to judge whats in the best interests of another nation.  Lets remember, Chretien signed a symbolic accord and did nothing about it as well.  Lets remember, Justin set the exact same targets Harper did.

There is a split in Republicans  over key provisions-- especially the 20% tax on imported goods which is expected to be passed on to consumers.

0,"A powerful article I will have to agree with. If Trump will persist on getting  his way in the world there will be serious consequences. Not only on trade - but also on defense co -operations.  Countries will not play along anymore. if there is nothing in there for them.  Why should NATO countries have to spend 2% of their GDP on defense. More weapons do not necessarily make the world a safe place. Why not talk about nuclear disarmament instead of non nuclear proliferation. You see already the discomfort of the South Korean government forced o play along with Trumps harsh rhetoric. The leader of the German opposition speaks of making his country a nuclear weapon free zone aso. All of these things might no be happen of course but you can see the resistance building.

0,"If you raise enough tax money, the implication is that the bonds will be paid and that makes them more attractive.  What is better for your children, taking the money once or taking it and giving it back with interest?  Recent experience has shown that taxing bondholders more as an economic class has decreased the debt while keeping bond prices low and growing the economy.  It is working very well, much better than the Bush economy. Blocking any Trump tax bill will oddly enough give him the credit for a strong economy while he lives off of the Obama policies.

Trump also doesn't expect the avalanche of lawsuits that are heading his way from almost every single private landowner from whom Trump will need to seize property to build his ridiculous wall.  That property is all privately owned, and volunteer lawyers are stepping up to help every land owner fight Trump tooth and nail over the seizure of their land.  The appeals will never end.  Did any of you wonder why none of the border state congressional delegations support Trump's plan?  Because Trump will need to seize their constituents' land to do it.  Good luck with that.  Trump is a psychotic.  The sooner he is impeached or resigns the better.  Pence is no bargain, but at least he isn't insane.  The first 100 days days have been a complete failure.

It really doesn't seem to make any difference how nasty and mean-spirited he shows himself to be.

It's no different than some of the things Obama claimed he would do that he didn't actually do because he didn't have the power to do them. Presidents have been doing that sort of wink-wink-bully pulpit policy for as long as I've been paying attention ... Carter was president. Sometimes, just by saying it, presidents put pressure on companies to do certain things that they would not otherwise have done.  And, I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover that US steel isn't that much more expensive in the Dakotas than Chinese steel, given shipping costs.

I think not, yet it was an event that shaped at least 16 years of our foreign policy.  We can't change the past or forecast the future perfectly.    This is an opinion site and not a crystal ball.  There's plenty of room for interesting speculation.  I don't know where the  Republican party is headed, but like you, I think the Trump influence will end when he loses the election.    What survives from that  party is beyond me.  Legal abortion is at it's highest level of support ever.   Women's power in our culture has been on an upward trajectory for at least 4-5 decades.

0,"Actually, in general, leaks ARE a major security risk. It bothers me that leaks are being used on this. The good news is that the intelligence world is releasing information SLOWLY after each time that trump's ppl lie. But each of these other leaks, and some of the intel world's leaks, actually are concerning. With enough of them, Russia, CHina, AQ, Talibahn, ISIS, NK, etc are able to connect dots and figure out how and where we are listening. In addition, they will learn which of their commlinks are open to us and then close them up.  Keep in mind that post cold war, we actually cut not just the DOD, but also our intel world a great deal. Sadly, many run around screaming about NSA, NRO, NBA, and CIA and do not understand that these make it so that we do NOT need to go to war unless needed. Their jobs are to locate spies in our ranks, and to figure out what is true out there. CIA/NSA told us that IRAQ did not have WMD,but W lied. Trump is the same way.

0,"Michael Doucet is also being disingenuous. Should Mr. Trump authorize torture, it will change almost nothing about information sharing with the USA.  First, in quantity I estimate that 99.999% (adjust the decimal place as you like) of intelligence information is electronic information. Governments hoover international and domestic communications systems for intelligence, and then share it with their allies. There's no torture involved, obviously. So nothing will change about the vast majority of Canada's secret sharing, should Trump decide to use torture.  Second, unless the USA reveals that a specific piece of information was gleaned through torture, how would a Canadian spy agency know? If fact, Canadian spies DON'T want to know. That way they can receive the information without concern for violating Canadian rules.  Remember, it's not law that Canadian spies can't use information obtained under torture. It's just a technical rule that the government can change at will.

It has agricultural subsidies that distort trade and lead to gluts. Again, Trump proposed changes to subsidies but has met resistance from Democrats and backroom Republicans.

The treaty has given us insights into Iran's program and the location of its facilities and how the program was to work. If Iran violates the treaty and military action is required, we can effectively attack key targets. However, after Bush tore up our treaty with North Korea 15 years ago, North Korea has stepped up its program in deep secrecy and we cannot effectively target key facilities, particularly since North Korea has been mobilizing and hardening its facilities and weapons. US military strategists supported both treaties because of the inside view it gives us of their programs. In hindsight would have been good to keep the treaty and work to keep tightening it.

When did any president of the United State previously summon the peasants to the White House to hold a rally for legislation that at best is half way through the process of Congressional approval. Never according to all the reports on this Trump victory rally. Will Donald be as eager to rally when the Senate does not pass this legislation as written or we he resort to tweeting how any changes are by his design.  No, more likely Trump will blame the media, Obama and the Democrats for what ever does not go his way.

It is exactly what he is doing with NAFTA and exactly what he is doing with North Korea. And it is always better to negotiate from a position of strength.

As you say, wealth and growth in wealth in the past decades has gone primarily to the very rich. Trump's tax plan gives tax cuts to everyone, but to the richest most of all, so I don't see that helping either.  His desire to bring back manufacturing would help wages, perhaps, but I don't see that as realistic, unfortunately.

The only thing concrete is that the email accounts of the DNC and John Podesta were hacked. No evidence that the Russian government is directly involved in any way and no agency makes that claim. The issue has nothing to do with hacking Hillary's email. There is also no evidence that any election system was interfered with in any way. No voting machines or any other voting system was interfered with in any way. There are at least two groups that admitted hacking the DNC and released some of that information.

First of all, last year when Kaepernick said """"he could not respect a flag or a country that oppressed people of color"""" and sat during the anthem (IMO probable not the right way to go about treating social injustices).  Second, Most peoples feelings toward the anthem and the flag during sporting events and what that symbolizes to each individual person.  Third, President Trumps speech about athletes and them kneeling and disrespecting the flag (IMO probable not the best way to discuss the topic with pro athletes/owners).  All of these topics could be debated for the next 6 months, but that is not going to solve the problem.  I for one would like to return to football being played like God intended to be played and move forward from these polarizing topics.  Not that they are not important issues, but I feel that the NFL is a business and respect the customer.

1,"I'll start near the beginning of Ibbitson’s rant and maybe someone else can carry on from me. Former Kenyan citizen Barack Obama arrogantly refused to produce his long-form birth certificate, which he should have done when he was running for president in 2008. Trump should be commended for publicizing the issue; he was the one who shamed Obama into finally producing it in April 2011, about three years after Obama should have done so. It is a fair criticism that Trump kept at this issue even after the release of the long form birth certificate when he should have dropped it. However, if Obama hadn’t joked in a banquet speech, in Trump’s presence, about how now that he had produced the long form certificate Trump could get on with questioning the moon landing, Trump probably never would have run for office. Why does Ibbitson fail to see that Obama behaved like an insufferable twit? We hit peak Ibbitson long ago, and the descent has been steep.

Bill denied any knowledge to Congress but the CIA rewarded him with a trip to the White House. (they don't forget their friends).  Clintons brother served federal time for coke running and many people with intimate knowledge of the Clintons drug use and coke selling ended up dead over the years, including Vince Foster who threatened to blow the lid off this and other stories and paid the price.

0,"On the one hand, one has to give Pavone credit for standing up for his convictions, despite criticism and controversy and consequences.   He does want to bring an awareness of the physical reality of what abortion really is into the public eye.   And even though some NCR readers and others might not want to face or view that reality, it still is the reality.  On the other hand, placing a dead fetus on an altar seems to me to be very inappropriate, to say the least.   Also, I personally can't see how any Catholic could in good conscience truly support Trump (or Clinton).   I would also add:  Neither Pavone nor hardly anyone else talk about the *True* and primary tragedy of abortion:   that is, that when these infants are killed, they are deprived of the Beatific Vision because they die in Original Sin.  Unlike Benedict XVI and pretty much everyone else, I assent to the dogma of the Limbo of the Infants.

Which, in turn , will set precedence so no other president  will try to undo monuments again in the future. As for the reservation by Obama, they cannot be undone either, the 1953 law does not allow revocation of permanent reservations.

In 1971 President Nixon wanted to leave his mark on history so badly, he complied with every demand China asked so he instructed his Secretary of State to make the """"Shanghai Gesture"""" which had the United States state public that Taiwan  was not a sovereign nation but belonged solely to the The Peoples Republic of China. A treaty violation.  Less than a month later in 1971 President Nixon also instructed the United States Ambassador to the UN not exercise a US Security Council veto for the expulsion of the then sovereign nation of Taiwan.
"
0,"Exactly.  Trump declared on 30 August that: """"It is a waste of time to try to talk with NK.  They only understand one thing.""""  A few weeks later, Tillerson said that the US was doing its best to try to talk with NK and achieve  a diplomatic solution, albeit the NKs had shown no interest whatsoever in negotiation based upon their complete de-nuclearization -- which is Trump's bottom line.  It may be altruistic to attempt to negotiate with a regime like NK which does not want diplomacy, but submitting a letter of resignation is the honorable thing to do if you disagree fundamentally with your boss.

0,"Someone is here illegal. The illegal person kills someone and he post bond shortly after he beats someone to death. So a 19 yo killer who is here illegally kills an old guy in jail. I thought murder in itself was  un-bond-able offense. Than ICE cops let the illegal bad hombre free in to the USA. So our local cops allow a murder in jail, The cops let out of jail an illegal person even after he kills someone while ICE cops are out eating donuts. Trump is trying to fix this.

0,"This kind of one sided reporting is what got me on Breitbart,Infowars and the Corbett Report when Trump started making more sense than Clinton.  How come is it Ok for Mexico to have a wall on its southern border with Central America and aggressively remove illegal aliens from Mexico aggressively but the USA is racist if it wants to enforce its immigration laws?  Does this logic apply to Canada as well?  Is that why we cannot enforce our immigration laws in our sanctuary cities like Toronto with an estimated 250,000 illegal aliens getting full government services.  I guess us taxpayers should just foot the bill and shut up for  fear of being perceived as racist

I think everything he does -- including opposing Trump when he thought Trump couldn't win and supporting Trump when he realized that Trump had won -- everything he does is to advance the regressive social and economic ideas of Rand. And so Ryan easily transitions from one of Trump's chief critics to one of his most energetic boot lickers, simply because he believes that Trump will sign whatever Ryan puts in front of him.  And he probably will, too, if Bannon says it's ok.

0,"It is disturbing to think that a journalist was motivated to even ask whether the press aides had the intention of telling the truth. As to statistics, Mark Twain was right when he said figures don't l1e but l1ars can figure, but all the same, they are usually a good part of the basis upon which policy decisions are made.  The 1984 comparisons here and in other articles are apt in a way, since it is evident that Trump and his cabal have no compunctions about stretching the truth. The big difference, though, is that Oceania used privation as a tool to control its citizens.....artificial shortages of decent food, tobacco, liquor, clothing and accommodations.  I think the Donald is more likely to use bread and circuses to distract the populace from his less savoury deeds and uneasy relationship with facts. The promised tax cuts, bluster over international trade, and funding cuts for NGOs who support abortion will all play very well with the nationalists who voted for him.

There was a small breakaway group that left the officially sanctioned march route and took off east on 11th avenue. Probably there would have been no """"riot"""" (and it wasn't much of a riot) if a driver who admitted he could have driven around the marchers as other cars in front of him did, chose instead (in his own words) to confront the marchers head-on, even, as he said, surging his vehicle directly into the group. What followed was deplorable, but the driver certainly did his best to intentionally provoke the marchers. There was ample blame on both sides. I don't consider Mr. Sparhawk to be in any way an innocent victim.

The memo from the FBI does not cut it because it says that Comey violated FBI rules and policies in the release of derogatory information on Hillary after the FBI investigation concluded that there was no evidence to submit the case to the DOJ for prosecution. Comey was also wrong to send a letter to Congress just before the election on additional documents in the case because it violated FBI rules and policies. Trump would never agree with a memo like this. Trump fired Comey because he was aggressively pursuing the investigation against Trump and his advisors when Trump wanted the investigation stopped. This means Trump was interfering with or impeding a federal investigation, a violation of law.

The US economy has done extremely well over the last eight years, let's not forget how bad 2008 was and how far they have come.  On the flip side, certainly there is a lot of pageantry on the part of the Democrats in skipping the inauguration, and that is divisive nonsense.  The issue is this.  As much as I disagreed with the politics of George W. Bush, I never questioned his morals, his ethics, or his professionalism.  I would not say that of Donald Trump.

0,"It's ludicrous to analyze Trump's vague policy pronouncements. Instead, we must consider his character first. He is ONLY interested in himself. I'll bet he cannot name the cabinets he is to fill, much less who heads them now. There is nothing there. How about this: if there is no God, then proclamations in the Bible become moot. Trump is that no god. He is zero. His proclamations are as ephemeral as dandelion seeds in a breeze.  Pundits err mightily in giving weight to his words.

0,"Trump's threat was less of a bargaining chip than a sop to his base in America's rust belt. Forcing Canada and Mexico to fast track negotiations is another thing he will claim to have achieved in his first 100 days. Never mind that Canada had already signalled its willingness to negotiate.  Dealing with this unpredictable, unreliable, untruthful prima donna to the south will be the major test of Trudeau's leadership. If Trump is targeting Canada, it's because - having been blocked everywhere else he turns - he sees us as a pushover. Softwood lumber was meant to soften us up.  So far, Trudeau has chosen to hold fire - no doubt on the advice of his senior advisers. And while that makes sense until we know the full extent ofTrump's demands, there will soon come a point when Canada will need to call his bluff. That will mean putting everything on the line and forcing congress to choose sides. It's the only way to deal with a bully.

Nazi fascism never disappeared despite the conquest of Hitler's Germany.  The same mentality continued in both Republican and Democratic parties immediately after the war with the Republicans carrying on the torch under the guise of anti-communism.  All working to reestablish the ideology in this nation to fulfill the same Hitlerian dreams. Now completed with the Republican ruling of all government branches of government, especially the Supreme Court and Presidency.  Succeeded with the Scalia Court traitorous actions identical to the segregationist decisions of the 19th Century to fix in law legal rule by Corporate elite.  Succeeded with the rigging of state election systems to allow the new Hitler, Trump, to hijack the Executive.  N.S.W.P.P is just the former name of the Republican party.  Time for a Revolution.

People do not generally know that Harris County is already Blue! Texas is going Purple fast - Democrats will likely pick up seats here. Republican's in Congress are behaving like zombies. Pelosi's tamping-down of impeachment talk is smart. There's a reasonable chance she could be Speaker again. The upside for Trump is it will make his infrastructure programs a reality - unlike today. The fact is, the Republicans in Congress are Trump's real obstacle. I can't imagine he will not soon realize that and throw them under the bus.

Here's what I get from Brooks' column, and it's precious little: """"Her campaign proposals sidestep the cutting issues that have driven Trump, Sanders, Brexit and the other key movements of modern politics. Her ideas for reducing poverty are fine, but they are circa Ed Muskie: more public works jobs, housing tax credits, more money for Head Start.""""  OK, but Brexit was a tragedy born of nationalism and xenophobia; the same with Trump's nationalism and xenophobia.  Jobs, housing support, and Head Start were good ideas in the past, and they are still good ideas, and let's remember, the Republican Party is opposed to all those ideas.  Forget Trump; Clinton is as good as it gets.

0,"You are right. Once upon a time we did have moderates and extremists on both sides. That began to change in the late 60's, early 70's. The left drifted further and further to the left while the right also drifted to the left. That is the politicians that did. Most of the rank and file republicans/conservatives have not moved at all and for many years, most of the rank and file democrats/liberals did not move either. As the democratic party have removed almost all of the moderate liberals, otherwise known as Blue Dog democrats, the left has become more and more extreme. Politicians on the right have also moved more and more to the left until now they are from center right to center left. The Tea Party was a reaction to out of control government spending by both parties, mainly republicans. Those we like to call RINO. Both sides gerrymander everywhere they can.

0,"“We” may have to destroy North Korea? Does this mean Trump will lead the fight up front with his bone spur? ============ No. Trump will fight the same way Obama fought the war in Afghan......or did you forget that Obama never served in the military either. - But let us be clear: Trump is talking about a response to an actual attack or a 100% credible threat in which NK has or plans to use nukes to attack the USA of an ally of the USA. At this point, no such attack or threat is imminent. - But NK is working on that even as we speak. NK is not launching missile tests and conducting nuke tests because it is developing a """"medical research program."""" They are making nukes to use nukes......either against the USA/ally or to keep the USA out of their plan to re-unite the Korean Peninsula by military force.....which is still their dream 60 years after the Korean War ended.

0,"My read of Trump is that he doesn't form views based on conviction but on expediency. Every politician does that to some extent, but with Trump it seems to be pathological. He really is a political anomaly. He's not a conservative or a liberal or a moderate. Nor, to be fair, is he a liar in the sense that he says things he doesn't believe. I think that when Trump is """"in the moment,"""" he can convince himself of anything.  He changed his view on abortion when he decided to run for president as a Republican. He changed his view on waterboarding because he no longer needs it as a campaign issue. The same is proving to be true of prosecuting Hillary Clinton, financing the border wall, etc.  Some might call that flexible pragmatism. I call it opportunism.
"
0,"I have to say, last night probably put it away. Trump needed desperately to have a great night, stop the bleeding, and fix some of his broader appeal issues. He failed to pull it off. Instead he launched more than a couple attacks that became much derided sound bites this morning.  He played to his base, but he hasn't stopped the GOP bleeding, including the full loss of Paul Ryan's assistance this morning. With a month left until the election and voting already occurring, Trump missed his one chance to fix the spin on this issue. Barring a devastating October surprise for Clinton, it's looking strongly like her election to lose.

0,"A need for a pathway to citizenship is clear to a slim majority of Americans.  It is opposed by a minority of Americans. But a key to creating a political majority is what many demand as a precursor.  The precursor is enhanced border security.  Call it what you want. Then we need a clear, but difficult, pathway to citizenship for those here illegally that is more onerous than it would have been if their entry had come legally - else we inspire more of the same. And then we need what Trump has called """"a great big beautiful gate"""" allowing Mexicans to come here legally in greater numbers.  It truth, Trump's approach will win out....and he is the only one who will be able to bring about steps two and three.

1,"Trump's own party is trying to get rid of him already.  If he completes his first term even Hillary could win (assuming the Dems are foolish and corrupt enough to run her again in 2020) but he'll either be impeached or be primaried off the ballot. The P***y-Grabber-in-Chief is causing young people to desert the GOP in swarms. He will destroy the brand for generations, and both Ryan & McConnell know it. McCain hates him more than he did Obama. A house divided cannot stand. My bet is he'll resign rather than face impeachment, and go back to firing people on TV and cheating employees out of their wages, two jobs he knows much better. He just cut a deal with the Saudis (the ones he blamed for 9/11) to sell them $100 billion in advanced arms for their attack on Iran in exchange for $200 billion in investments in the rust-belt. Jobs make people forget ethics and morality. Who cares that the Saudis are a genocidal dictatorship slaughtering beautiful babies in Yemen? Not you, I'm sure.

These are he decisions that will define America's commitment to democracy and equality and I have faith that Congress, even this Republican one, will do the right thing.

Trump has lazily delegated legislating to movement conservative legislators, and administrative tasks to movement conservative cabinet members, and the results have been disastrous. Lacking consensus, the party has descended into infighting and will emerge with nothing to show for it. Trump is becoming a victim of his own ignorance. He has no idea what’s in the American Health Care Act or what's in the budget. The agenda is being driven by the Ryan bloc of the Republicans and it's not what Trump campaigned on. All he cares about is who is flattering him and what networks are praising him. The whole thing will end up being exposed as the gigantic con that it is.

If foreigners don't like it, don't go to the U.S. 4. If foreigners who already have legal status in the U.S. don't like it, get out. 5. Keep in mind the underlying aims - the ban claimed to protect America but the real aim is to get ready for Trump's invasion of Iran. Trump is copying what Israel have done. Connect the two dots.

He'll create millions of jobs by reducing regulations , cutting taxes , and fixing our roads and bridges. He'll cut funding to Planned Parenthood and make abortions illegal again , along with pot. Burning our flag will become a crime . He'll help our vets and rebuild our military . He'll team up with our new friends Russia to wipe out ISIS and terrorism world wide.

Heck, Harry Reid was once proposing to get rid of birthright citizenship.  """"But those who enter our country illegally, and those who employ them, disrespect the rule of law. And because we live in an age where terrorists are challenging our borders, we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, and unchecked.

No Trump is not responsible for this behaviour. No country has abused the UNSC council veto more than the US (mostly to protect Israel from international condemnation).

Diplomacy usually involves lies, half-truths, and hypocrisy.  The Paris Accord is a feel-good measure which exemplifies all of those non-virtues, but for the sake of our putative allies who believe that appearance is more important than reality, Trump should not have stated that the U.S. will withdraw from the Accord.  Trump needs Twitter to get around the virulent anti-Trump MSM, but some clear-headed person like Kimberley Strassel needs to review and censor (if necessary) his tweets before they are sent.  With the DPRK, PRC, Russia, and Iran acting collectively to threaten the U.S., the U.S. needs all the allies it can find and it cannot afford to alienate, if possible, any potential ally.  Renouncing the Paris Accord has needlessly alienated key allies such as Germany and France.  That's a very bad thing.

The idiot dictator in North Korea who keeps threatening to send missles our way doesn't help and Trump is antagonizing him. Alcoholism is a disease. People shouldn't be bullied about it.

Sure, Hillary Clinton is far from perfect, but Trump is seen in France (and not only by politicians) as a real danger for the whole planet.

So, is Trump: 1)	a liar, knowingly saying something that is not true in a conscious attempt to delude his low-conformation supporters, 2)	a compulsive liar who has no idea whether or not there is a tax bill or what is happening in Congress, or 3)	a sufferer from dementia, who says and believes things that have no connection to reality?

0,"At its core, Trump's win was about low income Americans feeling ignored and disrespected. They grew up in American schools hoping for dignity and jobs, instead they found that their country seemed to prefer importing millions of people into the American family rather than take care of those already at the dinner table. What kind of family simply adopts more and more kids, cherishing them and bragging about them all the time to the grandparents, but ignores the kids they already have, giving them substandard medical care and housing and tells everyone that the imports are just smarter and better? That is the America that many poor kids live in, that is the reason for the votes for Trump. Me, I voted for Bernie, but even I, a progressive who probably would vote socialist, recognize  the disrespect shown to poorly educated kids of the rust belt, not to mention the logging belt. Cutthroat capitalism  abandoned the poor in the American family. Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon

Trump increased voter registration and got a grass roots effort of independents to join in.  The GOP DID come up with someone better.  Nearly 2/3rds of voters preferred someone other than trump.  But because candidates didn't drop out early enough, like Kasich and Rubio, come Trump beat them out with a plurality rather than a majority.   Trump's popularity is not due to how wonderful Trump is, he isn't. He's a buffoon.  But it is because how the GOP establishment has acted that has given rise to his popularity.  The establishment needed a good kick in the Johnson.  Even Paul Ryans' numbers are dropping.  The voters are tired of the GOPs failures to stick to their platform.  So while I can't stand trump, I am excited to see the GOP establishment get rattled.

0,"From the tone of the above opinion, it is clear that the civility and such proposed is of the liberal kind.  Teaching civility, tolerance, and respect is fine if it is universal, but the one-sided examples given demonstrate that true civility, tolerance, and respect is not what they have in mind.  Instead of citing anecdotal incidents from the SPLC, the speakers could have used the example of how a UO law professor was crucified for wearing black make up in her own home with no intention of hurting anyone.  But no, the UO-related authors cite Trump and Trump things.  They are hypocrites in my view.  Anyone serious about tolerance, civility, and respect looks to their own failures before focusing on those of others.  Tolerance is not a one-way street.  Tolerance does not only apply to things one agrees with.  When pleas for civility call for universal tolerance, they will have meaning.  Until then, fake news.

In this case, he probably saw a B-movie on cable TV, then imagined the Muslim ex-POTUS from Kenya was out to get him.  Imagine if Donald watches a movie about cigarettes being smuggled into the US from a foreign country.

There needs to be a way for residents that are not here legally to register and take steps toward legal status. Currently, even those that came here legally can wait as long as 10 years to become citizens. This is how many on legal visas become illegals when their visas run out.

0,"There's a reason that Donald Trump may win the Presidency. It is because traditional Democratic loyalists treated the """"poorly educated"""" and very poor for granted. Sure, now the Party seems to be coming out against TPP, but for decades, yes decades, the party that worked to get Social Security and other social programs out worked really hard for the graduates of Harvard, but pretty much just shrugged and said ...""""those jobs aren't coming back so deal with it"""", and  """"by the way, those social programs that you rely on to survive, we need to sacrifice them so the Republicans know we are willing to work with them"""".  I will most likely vote for Hillary, but Lynn is right about her record, voting for Middle East wars, she showed she had absolutely no taste for challenging the military industrial complex. So maybe the Democrats need to get of their high horse and mend some fences and try to get some of those """"poorly educated"""" votes back, perhaps by stopping the war mongering. Hugh Massengill

The  Plan doesn't mention nuclear with HQ just shutting down its Gentilly nuke which could be refurbed at 25% the cost of proposed wind power and Romaine hydro. Gentilly produced far cleaner energy than the mercury polluted vast, methane spewed swamps that HQ uses to produce its clean energy - more GHG's than coal  Burning firewood (Biofuels) in the Quebec plan, also produces more GHG's than coal over the short 20 year period we have to stop the fast appoaching AGW precipice.  Currently HQ  has no power to export during the winter peak load season and no power to export at anywhere close to the 3 cents a kwh """"market"""" price in the US.

Much of the Canadian trade with the US deals with either 'natural resources/raw materials' or 'manufactured goods'.  I cant see Trump saying 'no' to or resources but it appears that he cold be focusing on manufacturing.  If Trump scraps the Auto Pact and NAFTA,  then we have a problem.  In Ontario we are one of, if not the, highest cost energy jurisdictions in North America (thanks to the McGuinty/Wynne Liberals), one of the most highly taxed jurisdictions in North America (again, thank-you McGuiny/Wynne)and much of our manufacturing is either 'branch plant' (see Auto Pact) or simply provides parts/inputs to US manufacturing companies.  If Trump 'repatriates' manufacturing jobs to the US, it will not be good for Canada - especially for Ontario.  In retaliation I suppose the rest of the country stop selling resources to the US but where does that get us?

0,"oldgit,  You are correct. Trump badly needed a distraction from the growing scandals in the White House. However, there are going to be many more scandals than useful distractions! The other issue is that Trump is bound and determined to overturn, expunge and trash any and all progress made by America's first black (half-black really) president, Barack Obama. Trump's obsession with all things Obama doubtless stem from his inner insecurity and the reality that Americans are looking back at Obama with great and increasing fondness. Trashing Obama's legacy means that 26 million Americans will lose their health care, coal ash and other pollutants will be dumped with impunity in America's waterways, the quality of education in American schools will be reduced, Michelle Obama's healthy school lunch plan will be dumped and on and on. Trump's popularity continues to drop. More US voters want Trump impeached every week. US voters are intelligent after all!

In tearing up all the trade deals the world realizes that American goods can be bought elsewhere and US GDP begins to shrink.

0,"Dear Margaret,  As long as Justin wins elections, he doesn't need advice from you. Just like Trump didn't. You made wrong electoral predictions about both of them.  How about advising Trump not to act like a 5 year old with a Twitter account?  Who knows, he might actually grow up?

0,"I was just thinking that during Stalin's rule Russia had 100% employment.   If you didn't work they found work for you or you left home in the a.m. and never made it back.   Now the left is touting that 20 to 30 million people now have health care when they did not before.  Huh?  How many are forced to buy the non health care health care?   That is the vast majority of the 23 million number in today's news of projected uninsured.   OK so under Trump they will not be forced to pay $15 to $20 K per family for nothing (subsidized by the taxpayer and his or her progeny and grand children and even more distant generations)   But shouldn't you have a choice?  Stalin didn't think so.   I do.   Garbage numbers totally off the point.  This is america not 20th century USSR.

0,"Alceste, you brought up Trump - and his odious comment. Why?Not me. Trump lives in the USA - what does he have to do with CANADIAN culture? Work through it. Who, other than you, said anything about sexual harassment? The column is about 'rape culture'. Are you intentionally being disingenuous? As for Arguing, that's down the hall. This is Debating. With youit's akin to shooting a big fat fish in a barrel. Insults? You insult others almost every time you post a comment. But you do it in a weasel fashion just as you weasel word  'harassment' when the topic is 'rape', and  say 'tolerated' when the issue is 'occur'. As in, if a tree falls in the forest it occurs. But if no one was there to witness or stop the fall, can we reasonably speak of tolerance? Lastly, as one of my other posts notes, I have personally stood up against harassment of females. In fact, I taught Women's Self Defence courses 30 years ago before it was PC. Now let me ask you..what have you ever done for the cause?

Saddam's reign of Iraq was in VIOLATION of multiple UN resolutions (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1441 ) & many human rights - and the late Saddam would make Donald J.

A backwardness, a cynical pandering to the worst in voters, a hopeless prospect for younger generations especially. I keep waiting for more modern and moderate conservatives to speak up and contribute to the national debate, but maybe their voices are lost to the ranting of the rubes.

Now some of those people have either retracted their support or have merely gone silent. Their association with Trump will hurt them when they come up for reelection. Their behavior during this healthcare battle can hurt them even worse. If nothing else, they are galvanizing the Democrats (and plenty of unaffiliated) to fight even harder when Trump's term ends, and in the process the Republican party might shrink to its smallest size in recorded history. Of course, I'd like the same thing to happen to the Democratic leadership. Perhaps a backlash from their treatment of Sanders will help make it happen.

0,"The thing is, as much as Trump will spin it, this is not really a noticeable change in policy from the Obama administration.  Obama had reduced troop levels from 17,000 in 2014 to 8,400 by December 2016, those remaining troops were tasked with training and advising Afghan troops, and to continue counter terrorism missions.  The extra 3,900 troops now proposed by Trump represent a less than 50% increase, and will not even reach the 17,000 troop level Obama drew down from.  Compared to the peak troop levels in 2010 and 2011 of 100,000 U.S. troops, Trumps 12,000 troop level is much more similar to Obama's 8,400 """"garrison"""" level than it is to the 100,000 when we were actually fighting a war there.  There isn't any noticeable change in the mission, either.  Obama had long ago abandoned """"nation building"""" in Afghanistan, and the troops he had there at the end of his administration were focused on pretty much the same mission Trump just articulated.

But what mystifies me is when someone says they are pro-life (I have many doubts about that with Mr. Trump) that somehow that means they can do something about it in the white house. No Republican since Roe v. Wade was successful in this regard. Also, I wonder why we think that reducing the number of abortion clinics equals reducing abortion. That was not true before Roe v. Wade, as it is today. In my view the bottom line is not merely to make abortion less available, but to find ways to help pull woman out of poverty who tend more to higher incidences of abortion. Mitigating unwanted pregnancies should be the main focus. What candidate has the best chances of helping to do that? It would seem to me that this is a common ground that pro-life and pro-choice supporters could gather around.

But he has limited his promises to deporting criminal aliens - for over a year now.  Those who say otherwise simply have not been listening to him.  How about our educators telling these kids the truth:  Unless they become criminals, they are in no more danger than they were a year ago.

Security checked the bag and a trained police dog alerted them that the bag contained a bomb. It was a homemade bomb with an alarm clock attached.  The materials used to make the bomb were traced back to Estes, who confessed to “preparing to fight a war on U.S. soil.”  Since this was a white man, no non-stop viral news coverage, no Trump tweets.

Trump's plan is only to right a wrong long practiced by the so-called """"public good"""" - forcing people to pay for an education system that they believe either is not up to par does not match their own family values.

It is said we are to never disbelieve a woman raped until we have evidence otherwise, and this story seems to have been around for awhile. I could not see any reason to disbelieve this woman. Your judgement of Trump seems harsh since you don't know him. He raised a phenomenal family. Since I am not a party follower, I find his flexibility a plus.

Along with that, a significant number of Governorships and a fair number of Congressional seats also went R. This election the pendulum swung right, as it did during the """"shellacking"""" mid terms a few years back. Will it swing left again? Of course. The only question is when. But my original post, that you took exception to, is correct-the map is largely red, indicating that the country, as a whole with the exception of a handful high population centers, saw a need for change. And the EC did what is was designed to do.  Since you brought up imagined scenario's, it seems the biggest one was that Trump would never be elected, and Hillary essentially was a shoe in. Pesky facts.
"
0,"Trump's behavior is indeed often cringe worthy.  You know what else is also cringe worthy?  Destabilizing the Middle East at the behest of the neocon Dr. Strangeloves (at a cost of trillions of dollars, no less), demonizing Russian and doing one's best to instigate World War III for no good reason, and FURTHER opening our borders to millions of illegal aliens in the attempt to destabilize our OWN nation and society, all to further centralized control by the power-mad corporate & financial elite.

Funny, never once heard any of these geniuses discuss Obama's having banned certain Muslim groups at various times, the treatment of Cuban refugees at one point nor the fact something like 98% of the 'refugees' are Muslim while he actually turned back christian refugees.  Where is the 'honest' reporting on that? Does the left and their atheist cohorts despise christians to the point they are prepared to be subservient to Muslims?  Amazing.

0,"It was noticeable standing in the crowd at the inauguration that the Trump supporters, the people standing outside on the lawns, are not the rich people we saw in previous Republican administrations. They were lower-middle-class, humble people who were thrilled to be in the nation's capital for the first time. Their clothes were not fancy and a lot of them don't seem to be able to afford good dental care. They are hoping for good-paying jobs with more security. Trump was speaking to them directly when he said Buy American, Hire American. No one knows if these are empty promises from Trump, but his supporters see what he is saying as a hopeful message for them.

0,"Bubbles, Just so you know, while you weren't looking, the Syrian war has ended.  600,000 displaced Syrians are peacefully returning to Aleppo. And you thought Trump wasn't a successful President. . Obama drew lines and sputtered but did nothing, well actually he did worse than nothing. He prolonged the misery of   the war  by dithering, promising, breaking promises, drawing red lines and then moving them which led to an empowerment of Isis and a handful of gullible rebels thinking  they had America's support. . Nafta?  That was Bill Clinton's gift.  Another mess. Why put that on Trump?  Iraq is pretty well done with the retaking of Mosul that Obama lost. We are building bases there to stay indefinitely like we did in Germany and Japan after the war.

Now the people of Germany are protesting afterall theres not enough jobs for the people that are already unemployed little lone 800,000 more. The people of Germany did not ask to take on such a burden but the burden has been placed on them. The biggest concern is don't open the gates unless you have enough employment for everyone including those you invite in and to also be thinking about everyone who has children about there future for employment as well, meaning don't bring in a flood of people if it's going to hurt our children's future such as a lack of employment. http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/trumps-latest-foe-on-the-campaign-trail-german-chancellor-angela-merkel

A small group of failed voices, who think they know everything, and understand everyone, want to tell everybody else how to live and what to do and how to think. But you aren’t going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you are right.”

Then you set it up an argument (if you can call it that) with a false premise/allegation attributed to an amorphous stereotyped entity at best (left changing narrative). Then you buttress your positions with falsehoods (lies). I would categorize your comments as “Trumpian”, in that you make things as you go along to validate your own false narrative of reality de jour. What universally accepted scientific sources do you rely upon for such drivel? Are you simply content to remain in a stupor by drinking the Kool-Aid? Absurd!

Everything else is fascist business as usual.

0,"Here's a strategy. Concerned people should register as Republican, Nonpartisan or Undeclared and vote in the republican primary.  Select republican primary candidates who reflect your values...or if you can't find one that does, select one that is unlikely to beat the other general election candidates.  Not many voters turn out for the primaries so it doesn't take too many voters to make a big difference.  Do this at every level - Senate, House, Governor, and Legislature.  In local assembly elections, take note of the signs.  If  a local candidate's sign is posted in the same location that a Sullivan sign is, or a Trump sign was last year...that's a strong indicator that their values align with Trump and Sullivan's.

These are war crimes of the greatest magnitude. al Assad and his henchmen will be held accountable.  After the fall of Raqqa, it will become a clean up op which includes the Syrian government.

These commitments are fluid in practice, as no  one (Obama) has done much about the Russian annexation of Crimea, nor the military coup in Egypt replacing the democratically elected government.

0,"Obama has a history of association with anti Semites such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright for over twenty years, members of the Nation of Islam, Al Sharpton, and Reverend Jesse Jackson who calls New York """"Hymie Town"""". Israel knew where they stood with President Obama when he bowed to the waist before the Muslim King of Saudi Arabia like some dhimmi apostate. Also Obama's interference in the Israeli elections (with taxpayer money no less) and his snubbing the Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and collaborating with the figurehead Palestinian leader (Hamas really runs the Palestinians and Iran controls Hamas) adds insult to serious injury. This unprecedented UN snub and backstab from the US by not vetoing the UN condemnation of Israel shows President Obama really is an anti Semite himself.  On January 20th, 2017 Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States and Israel will know they can again trust the United States.

From 2011, Sunny Wang and his 1200 clients(likely many more), over a 5 year period, knowingly, willfully and deliberately obtained Canadian citizenship and PR status through massive orchestrated fraud, lying, creating false official documents and perjury? They deliberately lied under oath, with a straight face, to dozens of Canadian Citizenship judges, Canadian Government Officers and other Federal Officers over thousands of incidences during this period . They then all went on to commit tax evasion, health benefits fraud, welfare fraud and obtained immigration benefits for their relatives through fraud. They ALL had Canadian passports.

Some models of vehicles trade about within the auto industry but that wouldn't count.  I can't see what Canadians are concerned about at this stage.  If Donald Trump concentrates on his Mexican wall and border fee, (is this a tariff or a cost of crossing through a wall at the border) initially, why can't we wait until something else happens, if anything?  The media are trying to make this a major issue, when for us it may not be.  Mexico is not Canada.

Obama wrote, hand-wrote, personal letters to EVERY family of a fallen service member during his term in office. He had his staff research the details so he could personalize the letters. He called dozens fo those families. he honored their sacrifices in his speeches and in his actions. Even Bush, inarticulate and bumbling as he was, managed to send out letters to all of the families of the 4000 plus who died for his misbegotten wars during his term.

That worked much better than any formal trade relationship with the USA and was hard for us to give up in favour of free trade.  As the new generation of American trader-politicians re-invent these wheels, Canada must grin passively while aggressively getting out of the relationship with the USA.

For example, what can reasonably be expected in a one-time business transaction is different from what can reasonably be expected in a long-term business alliance.  In the Comey hearing, it was suggested that it was unethical for Trump to have met individually with the FBI leader.  Why?  Because """"that's not how we do things.""""  Trump's perspective?  """"That's a stupid way to do things; and by the way, you're fired.""""   Comey was no rookie;  Trump dealt with him accordingly.

The theory is that Russia hacked thousands of the DNC and Podesta's e-mails and provided them to WikiLeaks for publication, in order to embarrass Hillary's campaign and influence the outcome of the election. That theory just doesn't hold water... there is no truth to it. Julian Assange (WikiLeaks) has stated that the e-mails did not come from the Russians... there's no incentive whatsoever for him to lie about that. Interestingly...  WikiLeaks has offered a $130,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the killers of Seth Rich, a DNC staffer that was murdered on the street outside his residence on July 10, 2016. It's a possibility that Rich was the DNC insider who leaked the e-mails to WikiLeaks... likely we'll never know.

And the other candidates often had a """"dear in the headlights"""" look as Trump further insulted them and essentially refused honest debate...preferring insults. The media didn't call Trump accountable and his bullying improved their ratings....  Which worked.  The general was more of the same to the tune of """"lock her up""""....  FINALLY, and I do mean finally the media started fact checking Trump....whose Politifact lies level was/is around 80%. He had a lousy convention sans major reps, lost all three debates and has degenerated into such a sorry state his staff removed access to his Twitter account.  The man is not mentally well.

Making themselves hated and ridiculed across the world by electing Trump and supporting him is where this is going.

0,"Pretty spot on commentary. Clinton lost because of her baggage not her abilities. It didn't help that her husband soiled her reputation. It didn't help that Bernie Sanders diluted her base. And it didn't help that Trump had a better message than Clinton. Neither candidate was appealing to myself because each had qualities that frankly concerned me. The lesser of two evils was clearly Clinton because my personal values don't align with Trump. Ironically as Trump was campaigning to put Clinton in jail I was thinking that Trump was a better prisoner given his outstanding and pending lawsuits. I still think he's a serial sexual predator. 11 women is pretty convincing to most decent people. I'm concerned, but not shocked, that reading many comments on the Globe's boards before and since the election that there is this rising group who agree with Trump's values. I'm assuming most men who comment pro Trump aren't married or have daughters.

That fundamental shift in how the Israelis perceive Trump will be the proverbial """"elephant in the room""""; everyone will try to play nice, and if Trump manages to stick to the script his advisers write for him, they might even pull it off. But the lack of trust will affect every aspect of the relationship not only between Netanyahu and Trump, but more radically between Israel and the United States. The worst effect of Trump's recklessness with the Russians is that he didn't simply squander the trust and respect that the Israelis had for him personally; he's damaged the relationship between the two countries for a very long time, even after he leaves office.

1,"Yes, but even on a less traumatic level than Stockholm Syndrome, women typically do not identify with gender as a class, they identify or assimilate with the immediate men in their life.  Behind every angry white man who voted for Trump  there was an angry white woman who also voted for him. They found it easy to dismiss his bragging about sexual predatory behavior as mere """"locker room banter"""" - just like Trump's own wife stated on TV, because it's important for their psychological survival to keep their solidarity with  these key partners in their life. It's interesting to note that when women have lived among other groups of women, and shared their common experiences, and identity (such as our LCWR nuns) they began to identify by gender as women, and this led them to see the root of their oppression more clearly and to question the truth and their loyalties.

There are many contributing factors to her lost, but one thing quite significant is how many Obama voters (Democrats and Independent) couldn't bring themselves (or hold their nose) to vote for her while some Republicans hold their nose for their candidate. This almost visceral feeling continues to puzzle me as I for one, voted for her, despite many of her shortcomings but her positive attributes outweigh the negatives.

Flake just thinks Trump's unpresidential outbursts hurt the consevative cause and redefine the Republican Party in ways that don't have a winning future.  Flake is 100% right on this point.  Why other Republican leaders, who by the way think the same thing as Flake, don't speak up is a shame.
