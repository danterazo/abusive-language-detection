0,"The research is undeniable.  Teenagers can't go to bed because of the biological clock in their brains, and their metabolism.  Additionally , they need more sleep.  Unfortunately, people who don't understand science (people who still believe that Fetal Alcohol Syndrome isn't true and Global Climate Change is a hoax) , can't comprehend the implications, probably because they are victims of the sleep issue, and possibly FAS. Additionally, research has proven that the brain doesn't develop completely until 26 to 28 years old, so much of the AP, and STEM classes being taught are poor investments. Imagine special classes for most 26 year olds in AP/STEM class environments. Have you met AP kids as adults and they can't abstract?  We are waking to a new world where our beliefs about education and raising children are mostly injurious and false. Fighting it does damage to our people, our race, and our communities. Fighting the truth to save your ego or wallet is just disgusting.
"
0,"I agree with your sentiment, but not with the blanket characterisations. Saying: """"those who are less fortunate than they are"""" makes it sound like none of these people in the street had a hand in how they ended up there. It also makes it sound like those who are better off are only where they are because they were """"more fortunate"""". Perhaps replace it with: """"those who are in bad circumstances"""" might avoid the implicit politics.

"
0,"I think Richard is missing a key point: we don't have a coordinated planning process that spans regions. That means that there isn't a mechanism to encourage some business (and corresponding employment) to shift to places that both need the economic development and boast affordable housing. Without that, businesses tend to gravitate towards clusters and the issue of getting their workers to work (at least the majority who can't afford to live close to work) gets socialized to all of us in the form of funding for transit, roadbuilding, gridlock, etc.  Create some incentives to turn former bedroom communities (e.g. Oakville, Burlington) and surrounding cities (Hamilton) into employment hubs, and everyone won't have to either pay $1 million+ for a home OR contemplate spending several hours a day to get to work.

0,"People concerned about the future of their children and of other species on this planet will have to hope, then, that the trend towards rapid expansion of renewable energy and EV technology continues, so that the demand for the product meant for these pipelines dries up asap.  We can't count on informed and conscientious government action, clearly.  Even Trudeau is busy chanting the fossil fuel company catchphrases on their behalf.  Trump's approach is to silence anyone who knows about the escalating climate crisis, so he and his cronies can max their profits at speed.  Too bad for their kids and grandkids though.  Money won't buy back extinct species, intact coastlines, glaciers, clean water, and freedom from new disease vectors, as the planet heats, but I'm sure Donald Trump can find something terribly important to do with a few more billion dollars.  Maybe finance his sons to go and extirpate more endangered species in foreign lands, brave and manly men that they are.

0,"The devil is always in the details.  The survey just establishes that two-thirds of Canadians support going in the general direction that the government has been discussing publicly.  There will more surveys when the details become known.  I hardly think Canada or most of the world agreed to do something difficult just to look good in Paris.  They agreed because the science on this matter is settled now and the near future consequences are not deniable by reasonable people.  Governments also had personal motivations to agree.  If they didn’t do something, they would be hung as criminals back home eventually.  They can see what is ahead even if most of their own people can’t see it yet.

"
1,"You're right that Trump's supporters are sticking with him so far. That's because they aren't concerned with outcomes that don't impact them personally.  Trump tapped into an angry element that thinks they're being perpetually victimized. They'll stay with him either until they no longer feel that way (which will never happen) or until they realize he's just a gasbag. But considering that he gave ample evidence of being a gasbag before the election and it didn't matter, I'm not optimistic.

The Democratic Party lost the labor base in the Midwest because the labor base was too busy buying into Fox News talking points which led the base to believe that unions were somehow a bad thing for labor. The labor base, like the Republican base in general, got hooked into watching Fox because of their various prejudices and they just keep watching. Don't blame Democrats - Democrats are the ones championing the needs of the labor base. The labor base is just too busy being hoodwinked by Fox who then persuade them vote against their own interests.  As for Democrats pandering to wealthy donors, that's been an unfortunate necessity ever since """"Citizens United"""" in 2010 and it's sadly been """"pay to play"""" ever since.

Very simple Canada has always been desperate for people. It's cold, isolated and some what desperate place. Up until resent times nobody wanted to come to Canada so the promise of free stuff if it doesn't work out was a catch all. - It is feel good system but the hard fact is that it is a bad system. We reward people with low skills and merit, they continue to make babies and you end up with generation after generation of failures, low producers, drunks, welfare bums. - We need a sink or swim system. If you can't make money in Orillia you must move to Toronto. We aren't support your 'culture.'

While I think she's a little optimistic about semi-retirement at 60, that is still 12 years--and a whole lot of earnings/savings--in the future.  And remember, NO DEPENDENTS!  So, let's say she goes semi-retired at age 63 (fifteen years from now), and fully retired at 66.  What will she need to """"retire on""""? If she lives appropriately, then she can do quite well at even 65% of her $110,000 salary (that would be $71,500; her rent's less than 35% of her income--better than some mortgage ratios!) If her present business status (work flow, contacts) is accurate she should earn more than that almost immediately, and even better in the future.

I've been an admirer of +Diarmuid Martin for several years.

There are working poor, working homeless, the mentally challenged and folk who have just had really hard times with no idea how to recover.  They cannot be all just swept away; they are our brothers & sisters- we all are brothers & sisters. How about providing training and infrastructure to help them be on the road to self-sustaining? Help provide tools to grow food and form a 'community'.  Basic training & resources (clothing, health checks etc) to become employed.  With unemployment at record lows, employers should be open to helping and searching outside their normal recruiting pools. On Hawai'i, the big concern & spend was security.  CB covered this well- $900/person/month with security, ~$300/person (excluded).  Longer term safety solution should reduce the spend.

Its a wonderful thing. I remember when McDonalds were about to open their first restaurant and the local news front page  BUT WILL THEY  EAT IT. Now there are hundreds throughout the country. This is the same as our rail project. In the beginning it will start slowly. People will ride the train and eventually will tell all their friends what a great trip it was AND it will grow and grow and grow. The only thing we need to do is to remove those in Hart who know nothing about rail and fill the vacancies with those who have rail experience. Its a very easy solution.

A good priest I know said: """"chatter with God, don't over intellectualize your dealing with your Father God, speak to Him as a child would his loving father, naturally"""".

0,"cont'd  . . . . only from a certain, finite perspective. So we recognize God as love, as omnipotent, as omniscient, as merciful, and so forth, without being able adequately to imagine that all these attributions form an inseparable unity, because they are identical with each according to their being. That means we have a knowledge of God that overstrains our imagination. However, it does not follow from the unity of God’s justice and mercy that God's justice is completely dissolved in his mercy. Therefore the restitution that is required by justice does not become superfluous as a result of mercy. That is to say that sin is at the same time an insult to God and a violation of the divine order of things.  Justice requires the restoration of the violated order in the sinner himself as well outside of himself. This restoration is carried out by means of a penalty that does not contradict charity, but springs from charity. http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/4304/

So why bother with the catholic church? If you want people to just love each other, why not join a new age religious group?

It is always hard to pick a bottom (virtually impossible) and most times bottom fishing means the stock we buy will go somewhat lower before the actual bottom occurs. In bull markets, more often tha not these kinds of stocks do rebound at some future point in time (days, weeks, months) allowing a trader to take profits. That's been the situation for he past sevn to eight years, a bull market that has given long-only traders a wind at their back. This same strategy, buying low looking for a bounce, is likely to result in large losses in a bear market when these bargain-looking stocks are nowhere near their ultimate bottom.

Merkel is regarded with respect by western leaders and the leaders of China and Russia. On the international stage Trump is almost universally regarded as a buffoon. He so far has managed only to isolate and humiliate the US on the international stage. Hopefully, he will do better at the G20 meeting but very few leaders of other countries expect Trump to make a positive contribution. Like these other leaders I hope to be pleasantly surprised by the US president's performance at the G20 meetings.

I became involved when I heard a guy on the TV make the case that the second amendment was to protect slavery. He made a pretty convincing case.  Calling the truth nonsensical does not help your cause.  I suggest you read the following:  http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/13890-the-second-amendment-was-ratified-to-preserve-slavery  You might learn something.

Their dance is egoless, while at the same time every one of them is distinctly him or herself, giving worship as themselves. It is so beautiful, so joyful and true.  We hosted another Church, who shared their dance with us. It was lovely, but seemed a little more performative. I  can easily imagine dance ministries that might not be so gifted, but I won't hear anything said against dance ministries as such.

If a person is going to protect his/herself and/or his/her children, then they have to protect from ALL people. Once they've done that, they have no need at all for a very, very incomplete list from Nanny Big Government (NBG) of people who did something bad long ago, often decades ago. If they don't do that, they can read their SORs all day and night and they will not have added any protection for anyone.  But for the NBG lovers who support the SORs - how is it even conceivable that you have so massively failed to get the rest of your NBG Registries created? No Gun Offender Registry? Wow.

The Koch brothers have leases for a large portion of the oil sands, that's it. Suncor and CNRL each hold leases that are slightly larger than the ones held by the Koch brothers.  Especially since the consolidation that has occurred in the past 3 years since the article you got your info from was written. Even these are dwarfed by several agricultural landowners.

The truth is Francis isn't going to preserve the Church in the West with confusion about doctrine the majority of laity have already settled for themselves.  He needs to decide if the Church's mission is better served by his version of sowing ambiguity for the sake of the Burke's of the Catholic world, or biting the bullet and moving beyond the authoritarianism and black and white dogma the Burke's of the Church need for their own security.  If Jesus is the example we should follow, the decision is pretty clear.  We move beyond authoritarianism and black and white dogma.

If you subtract these real costs from the (highly suspect) figure of $14 trillion I think you will find it to be far less profitable than suspected.  In fact, studies have suggested slavery was likely more costly than many alternate systems (i.e. serfdom) where people were ostensibly 'free' but in such a state of indentured bondage that they were ultimately slaves (in that they could not choose to leave).  This type of servitude is sadly still abundant in parts of the world today. #Sad.

The """"county concern"""" metric, as you say, is subjective....I would suggest intentionally so.  It gives the Board of Commissioners carte blanche authority to veto any initiative they choose.  It's a egregious constitutional violation which, essentially, deprives citizens of the initiative right.  The initiative process was designed and placed in the US and Oregon Constitutions specifically to provide citizens a direct """"recourse for grievances"""" vis a vis an over-reaching and controlling legislative body.  The Board's assumption of a preemptive veto power to keep initiatives off the ballot negates that constitutionally protected citizens' power.  IMO, a Board truly dedicated to democracy would not even want such power, let alone try to grant it to themselves.  regards, Gary

0,"In general, if something doesn't need to be done, then it shouldn't be done.  There was no prudent reason for Wendy Lavarnia to have her 2-year-old son dry fire her handgun; for a kid that age, it simply encourages its perception as a toy that can't harm anyone.  That she failed to have full control of the gun in the presence of active children is another lapse of judgment.  That her spouse, due to felony convictions, was barred from possession of (or access to)  firearms should prompt all legal gun owners to take note who their household members are.  Depending on local law, failure to do so can put one in legal jeopardy.  FWIW:  I was safely taught to fire repeating .22 rifles at age 6, high-powered centerfire (.270 Winchester & 30/06 Springfield) rifles as age 10, and learned to be proficient with an M1911A1 Colt .45 Automatic at age 12 (using military """"hardball"""" ammo).  In my circles, this experience is not at all unusual or rare.

0,"I've lived next to a non-stop barker. Of course the owner never understood what was wrong because she was never there to hear the barking. When she came home, the dog stopped barking. And when it wasn't barking it was whining because she left a great dane locked in a small apartment for 16 hours at a time, alone. I love animals, but I'm allergic to them. I hate many of these self-centered 'animal lovers' who think just because they have a pet, they are 'entitled' to let dogs bark all day long or let them poop everywhere without picking it up or run off lease. No, I don't want your animal jumping on me. I don't care if you think he's 'gentle and wouldn't hurt a flea'. And your dog does bark all day long! So was wrong to shoot the animal, but I sympathize with him. It's overwhelming to hear an animal bark constantly, even if it's not all day long. Both should have been given a fine, and made to stop shooting dogs, and stop letting their dog bark. Sometimes the noise can drive u nuts!

Trump thanked Lebanese prime minister Hariri for Lebanon’s efforts in fighting extremist groups, including the political party Hezbollah.  “Hezbollah is a menace to the Lebanese state, the Lebanese people and the entire region,” Trump said.  There’s only one problem: Hezbollah is in the Lebanese government.    Hariri only became prime minister following a 29-month political stalemate in Lebanon that only ended after Michel Aoun, an ally of Hezbollah, became president.  Aoun named Hariri prime minister as part of a compromise deal of sorts, and while Hariri has an adversarial relationship with the organization, its members nonetheless have significant power within the government.  Trump.  Not one day without Trump being a national disgrace.  And in a really deranged moment, Trump wanted to take credit for 'providing healthcare' to Syrian refugees in Lebanon.  Say what?

Raising the issue of """"right to work"""" legislation is trade related within the NAFTA framework (state laws artificially lowering labour costs), and is not ceding the agenda.

The US, of course, will not concede on that issue, but's one way that the Canadian negotiating team can say, """"You wanted this dog and pony show. How's this?""""

First, self examination of your conduct relative to DIL's stated wishes/desires, how you can appease DIL to overcome your prior failings, and actions you would like that meet DIL's wishes/desires.

Electrification would be huge.  CN and CP would benefit from facilitation of main line electrification Quebec/Chicago, Montreal/NYC, Toronto/Buffalo, Calgary/Vancouver, and Edmonton/Vancouver. . Passenger trains are not incompatible with double stack intermodal freight - the express trains of our times. . The old CP line may be problematic, but passenger trains are very light, and the ability to re-align rail lines incrementally is far beyond what it was a century ago. . Access to Toronto? Yet another reason to re-build the Don Branch, and the CP commuter stations at Agincourt, Leaside Stn, Don Stn, and Summerhill.   The Don Branch is an invaluable jewel.  It presents so many wonderful possibilities.  Yet it sits, wasted. . The best thing VIA could do is agree with Quebec and Ontario to make their systems mesh.

Anyone with a single drop of Hawaiian native blood is counted as 100% “Native Hawaiian” and is not counted as any of the other ethnicities in his heritage. So isn’t it obvious that counting that way badly skews the data to make it look like “Native Hawaiians” are the worst victims?  If somebody gets cancer and has ancestry 1/8 Hawaiian, 3/8 Chinese, and 1/2 Caucasian, then anyone in his right mind who does data analysis should chalk up 1/8 of a tally mark for Hawaiian cancer, 3/8 of a tally mark for Chinese cancer, and 1/2 tally mark for Caucasian cancer. The people compiling victimhood data don’t do it that way. Tycoons of the Hawaiian grievance industry profit by having it look like Native Hawaiians are the worst victims, because all the grant money goes to studying Native Hawaiian victimhood and not for studying victimhood of other ethnicities.

Trump was ahead by at least 100 electoral votes and they had him trailing behind Killary. It was not until they saw that Killary clearly wouldn't make a come back that they posted the actual correct count of votes. I watched about five channels and CNN was the only channel that had the greatest discrepancy in numbers. CNN is the last source to be trusted for accurate news.

Then there is the Democrats who want to socialize everything , all these programs cost massive amounts of money from American citizens pockets, in other words they keep the poor poorer and are bringing down the middle class to match them. The Democratic Party knows very well what they are doing by bringing in massive amounts of immigrants into our nation and although they scream about the Republicans being for the rich they are the ones responsible for the great income divide, it's their policies that fuel it, they want us to be  poor, but Socialism doesn't work, never has and never will.

Our federal and state tax money dumped into schools, in particular to help ESL and ELL students (A segregated special group, not for the  """"whole)  money dumped into affordable housing to aid the immigrants working (Read Aspen, read Glenwood, Read Vail to see that) and so on.

It is the strongest economy in the G20. . If it goes into the tank now, Trump and the Republicans will have nobody to blame but themselves. .

When someone makes a statement, I instinctively ask what their evidence is and whether it supports their hypothesis. I think when we were using DISQUS, most of us tried to explain our statements at some length, and it was fairly clear whether we had enough evidence to convince others. The limitations of Civil Comments constrain us to state opinions in few words, but don't allow for us to support them with evidence, especially if the opinions are complicated. The result is a disturbingly simplistic exchange of barbs that solves little, if anything.  I think this is an incredibly dangerous time in our church and our world, and one that requires more than is being provided by NCR's essays or, increasingly, by our responses.

When sunspot activity slows, it gets cooler, and when it increases, it gets warmer ... totally independent of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Hence the cooling period from the late 1930's into the 1960's when sunspot activity slowed while the uptrend in CO2 concentration continued on a consistent upward path.  That's the period that NOAA kept adjusting its data on to try to make it disappear, because it contradicts their theory.

0,"The problem with long finance terms is not the term itself but how many people buy cars.  If you plan on owning one car for 10 years you should choose the term with the best interest rate and purchase price discount. This may lower your monthly payments if you go with a 7 year term @ 0% over a 4 year term @ 0% in addition to matching the cost of ownership on a monthly basis. If you want to be responsible you can simply divert the difference between the 7 and 4 year term payment to your mortgage/TFSA/RSP.  The big issue and the real story is that people use longer terms to buy a car that they may otherwise not be able to afford and then trade it in prior to the end of the term for a new car (which they probably can't afford), a process which creates negative equity. But people don't want to hear that.  Your term should not be longer than the length of time you are likely to own the car as you are not actually matching the payments to the true cost of ownership.

0,"Thanks for your post. My high school civics class was a long time ago. So it's nice to have that bit of information. Too bad the writer didn't think to include it.  In the past, if I remember correctly, usually when the Senate sticks some amendments onto a bill (budgetary or not) and the HOC strips the amendments off and sends it back, the Senate takes the hint and passes it. So I wouldn't be a bit surprised if this delay until Thursday is the Senate's way of stamping its feet to show its displeasure without actually provoking a constitutional crisis.  The Senate periodically stands up to the HOC, but usually only on major issues and when an opposition party controls the Senate. Beer and liquor taxes hardly rise to that level. So I'd be surprised if the Senate refuses to pass the budget.  In other words, there might be a story on Thursday.

0,"I am pleased to see that you now agree that Charmasa was fired for coming out. As Betty Clermont said. And that, despite your earlier comments, there was no 'resignation letter'. There has been no 'self-aggrandizement' by Charamsa. Quite the contrary. He has given up everything associated with being a Monsignor; with being a university professor; with being a senior official in the CDF. He has sacrificed the means to live, all the security which would have continued had he 'kept quiet' and lived a life of hypocrisy. His coming out was an act of  total honesty. All these things must be obvious to anyone with eyes to see, a heart to understand. It is a mistake to leap always to conclusions that may seem obvious. Reading is important. Read his own explanation ('La Prima Pietra', 2016). Read, for another example, his beautiful book about Our Lady:- 'Virtù e vocazione. Un cammino mariano' (2014).

Part of the higher cost is attributable to our small towns spread across vast distances, quashing hope of economies of scale.  Thus, no HMOs in AK.  But another part of the higher cost is that doctors, clinics and hospitals charge much more in Alaska than they could for the same procedure in the Lower 49.  Read T. R. Reed's The Healing of America, in which he describes other countries' systems where doctors cannot legally charge more than a set fee for a procedure.  Medicare comes close to that, but, until we have a single payer U.S. system, not everyone is on Medicare, so those who must buy insurance policies get shafted by the insurance companies, which make bank off of Alaskans.

0,"A primary explanation would be that they voted out of anger--less for Trump than against what had happened to them and against the people who had let it happen and essentially didn't care. They were angry because they felt diminished, reduced, disrespected, ignored. Trump was the anger vote. Without this anger a lot of the energy around Trump would never have gathered.  It is impossible to forecast exactly what the outcome of Trump's victory will be.  In my own view, the biggest threat is to democracy itself. Trump is nothing if not authoritarian. And a polarized population is not in a democratic mood. Not many people have taken democracy seriously lately. It's not at the top of the list of most social activists who already have the answers and don't need democratic processes. And the study of democracy is not exactly required in college.

One must not forget that massive borrowing and spending by the Liberals has indentured future generations for decades to come.  And real experts have already forecast a future in which technology and globalization will make even the least vulnerable jobs subject to being eliminated.  Claiming that alternate ventures will make up the difference is totally without foundation.  The increase in jobs needs to be seen from the prospective of just who is getting the jobs as more and more jobs are steered to temporary foreign workers and foreign nationals under Trudeau-esk trade agreements.

Because the Constitution vested the Legislative Branch with plenary power over Indian Affairs, states have no authority over tribal governments unless expressly authorized by Congress. While federally recognized tribes generally are not subordinate to states, they can have a government-to-government relationship with these other sovereigns, as well.  Furthermore, federally recognized tribes possess both the right and the authority to regulate activities on their lands independently from state government control.  They can enact and enforce stricter or more lenient laws and regulations than those of the surrounding or neighboring state(s) wherein they are located. Yet, tribes frequently collaborate and cooperate with states through compacts or other agreements on matters of mutual concern such as environmental protection and law enforcement.

0,"President Trump needs to talk to experts instead of Boeing alone.  The F-35 just won a competition — and it wasn’t even close. In every category, from combat performance to cost, the Danish government rated Lockheed’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighter as superior to Airbus’s Eurofighter Typhoon and Boeing’s F/A-18F Super Hornet in every category.  What’s striking here is not that the F-35 won: Denmark was already one of the nine Joint Strike Fighter partner nations and will build part of the plane. Nor is the size of the buy remarkable: Denmark’s a small country and it’s buying just 28 planes (less than the 48 it had initially considered to replace its aging F-16s). The big deal is how confident Denmark seemed in the F-35, resoundingly rejecting widespread criticism of the airplane’s performance and price

The two main are to have run a major competitive company through its ups and downs for something like 40 - 50 years. The second is to have mounted a campaign for the Republican nomination and then for the presidency. Both require considerable organizational and interpersonal skills.  In contrast, what has O'Leary accomplished? He had ownership a long time ago for a short time of a toy company that disintegrated shortly after he was lucky enough to unload it on a major. Since then he has done little other than use his very big mouth to promote himself.  Both he and Trump lack a grounding in their countries' public affairs and in global affairs.

However, there is a reference to the idea that some have claimed Peter Waldo, a young black man who lived with him on his ranch was a slave.  This linked to a fantastic source, truwe/tina, on Southern Oregon History.

One of them is law, in this case canon law. Cardinal Francis George wrote an article in 2003 Ave Maria Law Review stating, correctly, that law contributes massively to the formation of culture. Culture influences and shapes law. They standing in a mutually, informing, formative and reinforcing relationship. While canon law imposes the pontifical secret over child sexual abuse by clergy with the only exception being where there are applicable civil reporting laws, and where there is no mandatory reporting under canon law, the clerical culture of cover up will never change. Nor will it change while canon law prevents women from being vicars general, episcopal and judicial vicars without special permission from the men in the Vatican. The buck for canon law stops at the popes.

The collective outrage and denial of her views, and all the gloating references to unfulfilled predictions about the outcome of the election, bring to my mind the notion of the boiled frog.

If on the other hand you put it in pond water and start to heat is slowly, the cold-blooded creature becomes acclimatized to the gradual heat.  So too, I believe that freedom loving Americans can gradually lose the freedom they swear they can't live without, if it is withdrawn from them incrementally in such small but gradual amounts that they don't notice or care to notice.  Change is afoot, and it is not for the better. It comes at the price of freedom. But like the boiled frog, many Americans still insist that everything is just fine.

To the best of my knowledge, the needed assessment regarding the cuts' Title IX potential or real impacts has not been done. 4. Has Spilde signed the nationwide letter circulating among college presidents which reaffirms these institutions' commitment to care for all of their students?, 5. As a federal contractor, LCC is out of AA compliance etc.

0,"The roadways are public property, they are not free for anyone's use without proving they are competent drivers who also have agreed to be held subject to the laws that govern their navigation.  I never indicated that while being held at gun point you were imprison or detained, just potentially placed in fear of your life, mind you, it was not taken.  When someone drives impaired they are doing the exact same thing. It is a demonstrable fact that an individual operating any vehicle under the influence of any amount of alcohol is subjecting those around them to additional risk of harm from the impaired driver's actions.  So operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or other impairing substances is a crime for the same reasons pointing a gun at someone is a crime. Even if you do not cause an accident your actions justifiably cause reason for alarm, concern and show a disregard for public safety.

0,"Ms Wente's claim that """"According to classic Marxist ideology, people’s degree of oppression is determined by their ancestry and class"""" would earn a failing grade in any course on Marxist theory.  If she were a student she would be instructed to  read the original texts of Marx and Engels.  So called classic Marxist theory presents an analysis of  the historic development of capitalist relations of production, with a focus on exploitation of a working class by the owners of the means of production.  It focuses on the ways that human life, expressed as labour power becomes a commodity.  Marxism has little to do with the post-modernist liberal and bourgeois esseentialism of identity politics.  Do Ms Wente's own political views prevent her from engaging honestly and intelligently with Marxist theory?  Is her goal simply to invoke McCarthyism name calling to dismiss so called leftists?  Sadly her writing relies on base rhetoric without genuine intellectual understanding or engagement?.

European businesses are forming coalitions to oppose the USA sanctions, and Europe in general has said that any unilateral sanctions against Russia, and which further harm European business with Russia are not acceptable. So, not only does the USA not have the ability on its own to make its sanctions be effective in the manner it wants them to be, but there is also a possibility that Europe will become closer in their relations with Russia because of them, while the EU - USA relationship will decrease in strength, as was already occurring following Trump's election.

They had been nomadic; coastal sites were merely seasonal (as many subsistence camps outside the villages still are). Cultural change has been very complex; however, a settled life was required by churches, schools-- and trading, which replaced game populations that firearms had decimated.

0,"What's really lost is how the early Church regarded divorce. I have read that the early Church fathers never rebuked Constantine's divorce laws, which were pretty liberal. Some have spoken about marriage breakdown as sinful but not a barrier to finding happiness through remarriage. For example, Epiphanius of Salamis (later, St. Epiphanius) in his most well-known work, Against Heresies, stated that there were valid reasons for divorce for both husbands and wives. Also, since this breakdown was considered a sin, it was subject to penance, but once this was fulfilled, the couple regained their life with the community.  I read Jesus's words as pertaining in particular to men who had the freedom to throw away their wives. For women, this had extreme consequences. I'm not sure it meant """"you will stay married no matter what."""" As you know, in my Church (Eastern Orthodoxy), we follow the model above. There is nothing Christ-like in the exclusion of people from the community or the Eucharist.

0,"Keep in mind that only 60% of the PERS costs represent a benefit to current UO employees. If not for UO's obligation to pay for the state's past mistakes, UO pension costs would be modest.  The PERS cost increases are in large part due to the fact that the state made very generous promises to past retirees (yes, including many UO faculty, and Mike Bellotti), but didn't collect enough money from state agencies to fund those promises. In 2000 the average worker with 30 years was retiring at 100% of pay.  The state then made major reforms and the average payout for Tier 1/2 is now a more reasonable 66% - but it was too late.  Currently a full 40% of the payments to PERS go to fix the funding gap for past retirees - not provide for current workers as they retire. This ratio will increase as PERS attempts to get back to a fully-funded system. (Far better than most states).  For more see http://uomatters.com/2016/08/uo-no-longer-run-rate-even.html and the PERS report, which I link to there.

There's no mandate to require higher deductibles in the ACA, your boss just took a free market decision and bought a cheaper plan for the sake of his/her bottom line.  It also isn't to say that things would get better under the Trumpcare plans proposed recently. In fact, if deductibles are really your concern then you should be livid with your party, rather than carrying water for them: it's been widely reported that the AHCA was expected to increase deductibles by as much as 61%.  http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/22/news/economy/deductibles-obamacare-gop-health-care-bill/index.html

The other issue is that back when the idea was put out to vote, it was with the idea that it was going to cost 3.2 billion.  Those who voted YES all believed that.  How would it have turned out if it was stated that the cost would be over 10 billion?  Would we still have voted YES?

0,"Your claim of needing """"a couple of hundred more nukes"""" is pure baloney.  An EV draws the same amount of power as a 9,000 BTU air conditioner or a portable heater. ACs didn't collapse the grid when they were introduced and EVs won't either. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn) told the Senate Energy and National Resources Committee,  ”A conservative estimate is that we have an amount of electricity unused at night that’s equal to the output of 65 to 70 nuclear power plants between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.,” “I suspect that’s probably our greatest unused resource in the United States. If we were to use that to plug in cars and trucks at night, we could electrify 43 percent of our cars and trucks without building one new power plant.”

0,"First, I don't have much sympathy for the opponents to Assad. They were the ones who rose up in rebellion. They had the object example of what had happened to those in Hama who rebelled in 1982. Rebellion meant the country is now destroyed, millions displaced and hundreds of thousands dead.  Second, why is there no talk of going after those who helped to incite and support the rebellion? Should the Western powers be taken to task? What about those Saudis and Gulf Arabs?  I am so angry at what has happened to Syria because of outside meddling. Assad was educated in the West and is seemingly a nice guy but don't push him. A couple of decades and the situation may have improved for most if not all. Now, the country is in shambles with a massive diaspora in the West.

0,"YMMV; I never was willing to trust my teenaged boys and, especially, their friends.   I left my black powder out in the garage, then I got the call from the neighbor about the mushroom cloud behind my house as one of the boys and a couple of his friends filled a Pepsi can with black powder and set it off with a firecracker, destroying the dog house and wounding two boys with shrapnel.   The closest I've ever come to dying from gunfire was when one of my friends, we were maybe 15, was showing me his brand new Remington Nylon 66; he pointed that thing at me and pulled the trigger two or three times, it was empty of course, and then he held it vertically, pulled the trigger again, and the round that had been stuck in the tube fed and he shot a hole in the ceiling of his bedroom.   Sorry, even smart teenaged boys are stupid if there is more than one of them.   I stand by it; the IQ of a group of boys is the IQ of the stupidest one divided by the number in the group.
"
0,"It’s true that the Chretien administration  funded debt reduction through decreased provincial transfers.  But I’m wondering where the indignation stems from.  You can’t lower expenditures without making cuts somewhere; in Chretien’s case, the federal government elected to pay less for things that they aren't responsible for.  (Health is a provincial responsibility).  While I can’t say I am delighted with the prospect of decades more of deficit spending, I think it is to the Liberals’ credit that they are being truthful about it.  Little Stephen Harper revelled in financial sleight-of-hand and his unshakeable (yet stupid) faith in the resource economy yielded the 170B in additional debt that Trudeau inherited.  That same dependence on high oil prices meant an economy that had no chance of withstanding the shock of crashing prices.  Blame Trudeau for all of it if that solves your problems for you, but deficit spending on infrastructure and the poor  is good for a sluggish economy.

0,"The Green Energy Act was a business plan, that didn't work out so well.

Our multiple approval systems, public hearings and highly politicalized systems are driving businesses out of Canada.

0,"Because the one property has no access off Willamette St,. 4-J offered the owner some Civic Stadium property to build a driveway off Willamette St. However, Willamette St is at its narrowest in front of these properties and just off of 20th. The traffic is heavy, the bicycle paths are very narrow and there is a bus stop. A 20’ – 24’ two way driveway at this location not only ties up even more traffic but would also greatly increase the danger to motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists and especially children.  At that time, all proposals that came into 4-J for the sale of the stadium provided the same existing accesses to both these properties. With these proposals the property owner and 4-J figured it was best to not cut the driveway from part of the Civic Stadium property onto Willamette.  Instead, it was best to wait until the stadium was sold. It was expected that the buyer would continue with these accesses that have been there since 1946 and 1961.

0,"As the forest fires in BC show, Nature does not reveal a preference for any particular group, based upon their particular beliefs and group-defined differences.  Everyone flees together, and they stay together at rescue centres.  Similarly, I think cemeteries that accommodate people of all denominations, and those of no particular religion, would allow for the best use of forested lands, which must be bull-dozed and irrevocably altered to set aside even MORE space for funeral requirements for a growing population. There is NO need to discriminate on the basis of religion. Setting aside precious lands for each specific religion, or for those with different non-religious beliefs,  would be discriminatory ... and wasteful of finite land resources. Nature will deal with all human remains in the same way in the final ultimate 'inclusive' act, while human religions are preoccupied with different 'hereafters', which are not earth-based.

0,"Neither Harper nor Scheer """"pander"""" to social conservatives.  The fact is that there are a certain number of social conservatives in Canada and they deserve to express their views as much as anyone, and, of course, seek to have their views impact the political agenda.  This is not a problem.   While no one wants to see them actually dictating policy (similarly, no one want to see radical leftism dictating a political agenda) social conservatives deserve to have a voice.  Too many people just think social conservatives should be shut up and not be welcome in any party.  That's fascism as far as I am concerned.  There are solid arguments both for and against social conservative positions.  You cannot make an informed judgement about the issues without being aware of those arguments.  At this point, anti-Christian views and extreme personal libertarianism is favoured in the social arena, but that does not negate the legitimacy of other views.

0,"Private ownership of firearms in Switzerland has fallen by half in the last decade or so, though not as radically as it has in Australia.  From your many responses, here and elsewhere, I'm guessing you don't find actual facts particularly useful. It makes me wonder how you manage with doing police investigations and trial testimony.  Swiss military forces have been dramatically reduced in recent years. In addition, the gun suicide rate was recognised as such a problem that military personnel are now discouraged from keeping guns at home, and prohibited from storing ammunition. In case of governmental need, ammo will be issued only from secure magazines.  One result is that gun suicide rates in that country have fallen significantly, likely to be followed  by gun homicide rates, a high proportion of which occurs in domestic violence.  Of course, in the U.S. the NRA has used tools like yourself to generate an """"arms race,"""" which is the lesser version of """"mutually assured destruction.""""

They claimed that the columns and guideway are completed past the stadium but what about the cost to resurface the roads and medial strips along the completed structure?  They'll have to go back and disrupt traffic all over again to complete the resurfacing and medial strip.  I would think (common sense) that during the completion of the columns/guideway, resurfacing of roads and medial strips should have been completed while the traffic was already disrupted. That would have been the most logical thing to do...not having to go back and disrupt traffic again.

There are good reasons for both choices but what I am sure of is that I would never be as forthright or honest if my real name was forever associated online with my comments.  You may understand how that might forever unfairly prejudice or otherwise negatively affect anyone's professional and personal life. In my case the very nature of my profession restricts me from speaking candidly here using my real name.  If commenters were forced to use their real names then I am sure this forum would become quite restrictively bland and participation and readers would drop off precipitously.

In recognizing this darkness, the Church will humbly need to renew herself, and so continue to grow in holiness.""""

Why do mentally-unbalanced and psychotic cat-advocates always presume that if someone is removing a highly destructive, deadly disease spreading, human-engineered invasive-species from the native habitat to restore it back into natural balance that they must hate that organism? Does someone who destroys Zebra Mussels, Kudzu, African Cichlids, Burmese Pythons, or any of the other myriad destructive invasive-species in the USA or elsewhere have some personal problem with that species?  It is people who let a destructive invasive-species roam free that tortures-to-death all the native wildlife, wasted for their cats' play-toys, that have zero respect for ALL life.

0,"For a baseball keener you cannot make the games long enough. People are also caught up in tradition. This change would speed the game up!  What would slow it down and is even more important is to have a way of taking the umpire out of calling balls and strikes by a pitcher.  A scientific means of calling them as in tennis or a replay as in hockey shows what really happened instead of an official giving his best guess. These umpire calls can change a game completely instead of having a game played  fairly.

They see our sovreignity being given away to globalist concerns, they see an unchecked invasion of low skilled unvetted foreign migrants. They see every institution that this bunch touches politicized and corrupted. The Romneys, McCains and the republican party have allowed the dems to attack every tradition and institution that made this country what it is with no real push- back. By seeking to compromise with people that have no interest in compromise, they have sold out their supporters.

0,"... after the Oscars made overdue history by awarding best actor to Denzel Washington and best actress to Halle Berry, the first time black actors won both top performing honours in the same year. It’s a feat that hasn’t been repeated since.  ========================  Blacks make up 13% of the population of the U.S. When you consider that a good proportion of the actors nominated come from the UK, France, Canada, and other countries with a smaller black population than the U.S., a 1 in 10 ratio is probably closer to representative of the overall actor pool. That means in any given year, if blacks were represented in leading screen roles proportional to their share of the overall population nominations are drawn from, we should expect 1. of the 10 best actor nominations  to go to a black actor - or one every two years for each of the lead acting categories. So statistically, both a black actor and actress winning the Oscar  in the same year should be extraordinarily rare.

Toronto is an extremely popular city: clean, safe, job opportunities, accepting to all cultures/ppl. That means many people want to live here (demand is high). The supply of desirable living options can not possibly keep pace. Ergo, demand is far higher than supply. As a result, prices are driven up.

The Teranet National Bank HPI does include condo prices but its data isn't used at all in the CPI, even for the real estate commissions series that relates almost exclusively to resale housing prices.

Higher carbon taxes are simply necessary to drive consumption of fossil fuels down; they may or may not reduce revenue from other sources of taxation. There is no other way: it seems impossible to limit supply, and consumption seems to be affected only by price, not concern for climate change.

My own opinion is they use the term """"opioids"""" purposely to obscure the fact it's heroin...the term opioid is more of a catch all word that keeps the reader from making a firm determination as to what's causing the overdoses.  It's that type of vague, gray terminology that addict apologists use to muddy the waters and keep folks off balance.

However, in large enough groups, I've seen very successful results which truly do help to weed out the negative contributors.  I helped evaluate the Civil Comments tool for use here on AToday and have advised several of the technical folks through the implementation.  I will say one of the things that impressed me about it is that Civil Comments relies on hard data to develop their functionality.  If a feature doesn't improve civility, they remove it and find a feature that does.  The other important point is that the new software is called """"Civil"""" comments . . . not """"Good"""" comments.

In fact, regarding architecture, my daughter's school was constructing two new buildings while we were there, and they purposely built them using similar architectural designs so that they would not stand out.  Some might call it boring or too uniform and maybe so, but it certainly beats the crazy collection of buildings at Manoa.  It almost looks like there was an building design contest to see who could create the most unique design and when the contest was over, officials just decided to call it UH-Manoa.

Legislators started using the maximum federal per diem rate (instead of the stae system they used to share with all state employees and officials) when their effort to increase salary was rebuffed by a public outcry.  Then, the salary commission came along and raised their salary from ~$20,000 to $50,400, one of the highest legislative salaries in the country. And the commission's recommendations go into effect unless rejected by the legislature.  So after their salaries increased by about 150%, they continued to loot the state treasury by claiming the maximum federal per diem rate (which federal employees can't do unless their lodging and meal costs are actually that much).

So casual with the mixing of philosophy and hard science. You simply want it both ways. But it cannot be except for the simple minded. Bouancy, Gravity, speed of light. Speed of sound, photosynthesis, possibly the simple equation of collision between two bodies of  different mass.  Carbon dating. Etc. it goes on and on. Their is no God, except for the sun. Sorry to break it to ya. People who believe in some outside diety need to look only within shelves of science and medical books to find something pertinent to hang their hat on. Philosophy is fun. Religion is the oldest occupation next to prostitution. At least with the latter you get ur monies worth. And when did we fall? Do you have a time and date the world fell? It didn't make the papers. It's only falling because of religious zealots in my eyes. Oh your a lawyer.....ha!

0,"2016 Annual Lane County Homeless Point in Time Count http://bit.ly/2lR74mc  Of the 1,451 people counted: 434 people have a mental illness = 30 % 232 people have chronic alcohol/substance abuse issues = 16 % Total = 666 = 46 %  The total is somewhat misleading because there is probably a lot of overlap between the two categories. Mentally ill people often self-medicate with alcohol or other drugs to feel better. Homelessness is very stressful, making mental illness and drug use worse. Secure shelter helps both.  Nationally it is recognized that a “shelter first” policy is the best way of helping the chronically homeless – putting them in apartments and paying their rent. Once they’re safely sheltered other help can be offered. It actually saves money that is currently being spent on jails, ER visits, etc.

0,"Science studies natural phenomena and observable consequences that can be tested. Philosophy uses speculation, abstract reasoning about humankind, with a dose of personal biases.  Science uses empirical data, observations and tests. It explains the physical world based on the results of experiments, material evidence, and observable facts with help from mathematics. Science transformed our lives. People live longer and lead better lives thanks to material progress derived from science.  In philosophy, theories cannot be tested in a controlled lab-like situation. Marx’s political theories were based on ‘scientific’ precepts. Was communism tested before it ruined the lives of tens of millions?  The closest parallel between science and the numerous philosophical theories is comparable, with some exaggeration, I admit, to the difference between astronomy and astrology.  Kingwell presents his personal political leanings under the cloak of philosophy and science.

The RCMP are arresting and detaining them under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and turning them over to Canada Immigration for processing.  There is a very good legal reason why refugee claimants (not asylum seekers which are a completely different class of persons) are not being charged in respect of their entry to Canada.  Under Article 31 of the 1951 Convention on Refugees Canada has undertaken to not prosecute refugee claimants for illegal entry into Canada including any issues of false documents or fraud relating to that entry.  Canada has enacted that exemption into our domestic law as required by the Convention in various iterations of our immigration legislation over the years. Currently that exemption is contained at s. 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.  So no charges because the law exempts refugees recognizing that refugees who are fleeing persecution are different from other migrants.

Too many of our well educated entrepreneur taxpayers are leaving South Africa for greener pastures, especially Australia. I fear we have already tipped over the tipping point. The State capture issue and firing of our internationally respected finance minister means that investment funding from the international community does not come here. And unlike the Asian countries, we do not have what it takes to pull ourselves up by our own boot-straps.

If West Ukraine wasn't unilaterally attacking East Ukraine, there'd be no conflict. West Ukraine is an example of fascism, being the neo-nazi centre of the planet, having banned Russian-language books, having a government which was not elected democratically, and invading other regions in an effort to subdue them through violence.

I have been fortunate to have know a few. However, too many competitive and recreational mushers view these pets as objects to fulfill short term dreams and  goals without taking on the life expectancy of the dogs into account. While some of these dogs find great homes,  too many end up in unwanted ones and are abused because they were not raised as pets/indoor dogs or end up shelters where they are euthanized.

However, the game already was scuttled in 1844 when the main Player never showed. So the clear vision, plan A. had no plan B. in reserve other than admission of defeat headlined as, Soon.  So the failed mission and its  floppy accouterments of silly theology is the reason for its marshmallow character today.  Had it, Adventism, been an accurate event predictor of the end game, you would be sitting under the tree of life eating its fruit, sipping decaf right now. But, no, for 150 years the church has wallowed in uncertainty as to what it is because it can't be what was intended.  So, the new norm is old (confusion), the church was stillborn, and the multitude of re-creationists, visible on this forum, you included, are without portfolio, still searching for a good reason to keep the institution going.

0,"These are dogma and articles of faith, not history.  The historical Jesus is obscured behind the gospels. The gospel writers were heavily dependent on the Septuagint to structure their literary, theological narratives. The Church takes the gospels somewhat at face value, which requires quite a bit of cognitive dissonance. The furtive, apocalyptic exorcist of Mark is not the voluble, divine emissary of John. As Schweitzer famously remarked, when we go looking for the historical Jesus, we find only ourselves reflected in the quest.  <<Thus each successive epoch of theology found its own thoughts in Jesus; that was, indeed, the only way in which it could make Him live. But it was not only each epoch that found its reflection in Jesus; each individual created Him in accordance with his own character. There is no historical task which so reveals a man's true self as the writing of a Life of Jesus.>>  I await when all your pious prayer reaps the least little berry.

There is testimony for the Resurrection and tradition for the Assumption going back to the Twelve.  There are historical markers in the theory of original sin and even evidence for Iraqi patriarchs named Adam and Eve, but they are not our first parents and our first parents probably had no concept of sin and certainly performed no act of original disobedience.  Indeed, our first parents were likely Bushmen in the Kalahari Dessert.  The movie The Gods Must Be Crazy showed that at that time, they did not seem to have bought into the culture of original sin.

Increases in hot, low humidity days affects forest fuels and tree crowns as much or more than wildfire directly. Before prescribed burning in Eastern Oregon, pine needles on the ground are often bent to see if they can touch their ends without breaking. They broke earlier than normal this year due to the unusually hot and dry early summer days. These and other little indicators give on the-ground-foresters and fire managers a handle on how dry the fine fuels are in the forest and how easily they will ignite.  For example, the alleged fireworks that were tossed into a canyon by kids and credited with starting the Columbia Gorge fire might not have ignited a larger blaze had the fine fuels not been so dried-up, the day been cooler, and the forest floor moister.

This is further complicated by the fact that the tankers are up to 60 meters wide.  So these tankers will have 45 meters of clearance on either side at the narrowest point.  If the tankers manage to not take out a bridge they then get to pass right through a city of a few million people which is home to Canada's busiest port and its massive marine traffic. What could possibly go wrong?  Extend the pipeline to Delta Port and you dramatically reduce the potential harm.

Trump has never said he disrespects women, but many assert his comment prove he does.  Unfortunately, assertions based on projections of one's own worldview are without merit in objective reality.  Rationally, you know that Trump knows that about 70 percent of Japanese cars sold in the US are made in the US.  Of course, he knows this.

Moreover the Court acknowledged Khadr's detention was under US control. 	Legal doctrine states that a plaintiff will be unable to pursue remedy if it arises in connection with his own illegal act. It's not unreasonable to contend that while Khadr's interrogations by CSIS may have violated the Charter these interrogations weren't unreasonable in the context in which they occured.

The defendants in the above article have been fighting for Charlene's rights by writing letters and filing motions-the exact process a legal situation requires.

You know everyone will be given Pionts Smoints so any road you have not driven regularly will no longer be available to you or your kids or grandkids. Anybody ever after can buy the right to drive our public roads from someone who owns road rights.

It is revealing that this, and a bunch of wholly innocent emails which Hillary might have read but didn't write, are all the RNC spin-machine had against her, but that was enough for Motley and millions like him to condemn Hillary Clinton, then and apparently until Hell freezes over. In the meantime, the RNC was spending a billion dollars on hate ads. half-truths and out-right lies, while Trump was getting a tailwind from Russian hackers.

0,"Thank you, Foster McTeague.  So.  As applying our own Constitution of THIS Nation, and its legal citizens, you hold unto the position, that one cannot imply an amorphous potential of threat, even, at the same time, many individuals residing within said Nations, present a concrete, overt threat, unto our Nation as an individual, or group?  How does a sovereign Nation, such as ours, determine which individual is simply an amorphous threat, and which individual is an overt threat?  We cannot, because as you state, we are not the 'thought' police, and thusly, should err upon the side of caution within regard unto these Nations that the Obama administration deemed the most dangerous unto our own Nation.  You would not allow a potential dangerous character into your own residence, say a possible gang member, without finding out more about them, would you, Foster McTeague?  Well, nor should this Nation allow such entrance, until said individual has been deemed safe, and worthy to do so.

I generally find the ones who use it in the negative sense do so as a way to both express their deep disapproval of a person, action etc. with which they strongly disagree and a back-handed attempt to assign responsibility for it to someone else.  Let's see, Harriet Tubman enabled slaves to get free of their owners. In her view, she followed a clear moral and ethical imperative.  However, in doing so, the slave owners from whose she liberated slaves would say she enabled the slaves to break the law and cheat the owners of their property.  Like that.

Why assume that our own national leaders are inherently inferior (and also our grasp of the key issues) to those of our leading Great Power ally?  Canada has its own interests and we and our leaders are well able to advance them maturely and not be overawed by the current US President and his interest groups. Canadians should debate together the details regarding those interests but a neurotic assumption that we’re not up to the task (or, conversely, that we need to stridently assert our independence) is simply immature.  Hopefully, once the “shock & awe” opening that mark any Trump initiative and US quasi-Mercantilist assumptions abandoned, Canadians (having remained firm, reasonable and focused) may well find that the renewal of NAFTA on a reasonably equitable basis is possible.

0,"Here in Alaska it is not mandatory that sales be reported.  The assessor sends out a request to a buyer but I would guess most end up in the trash ... none of their damn business.  I, too, can be one of those none of their damn business types; however, it can work against an owner when an assessor bases values on a model or a best guesstimate of what the value might be.  If they had access to those appraisals, it would seem the assessments would be much more in value with fair market value (FMV).  The definition of FMV is the probable price at which a willing buyer will buy from a willing seller when (1) both are unrelated, (2) know the relevant facts, (3) neither is under any compulsion to buy or sell, and (4) all rights and benefit inherent in (or attributable to) the item must have been included in the transfer. FMV is generally the basis for tax assessment and court awards.  I think the state likely obtained FMV and local food production will be on the rise.

There will be no cold left.

0,"Yep, I agree that there is a huge problem with big government and its associated subsidies.  For comparison, the Port of Anchorage tank farms did not get ADEC, EPA, CG, BIA, funding to build the infrastructure.  Nor do the owners of our port facilities get government funding for spills that result from the mismanagement of their facilities. The degree of disregard for the environment that I have witnessed in the bush is disappointing. I have authored spill plans for many bush communities; so yes, I do know a bit about many rural bush communities and their lack of respect for the environment.  When it comes to subsidies for energy, nothing comes close to the government subsidies for solar power.  Subsidies for natural gas and petroleum liquids come in at $0.0006 per kWh.  Solar gets subsidies of $0.9680 per kWh.  That means, according to the U.S. Department of Energy,  that solar power gets 1,600 times more subsidies than natural gas and petroleum liquids per kWh.

0,"Dear Doug:  There are other ways to look at this.  The uprising in Syria was originally about a suppressed people seeking democracy, as in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.  Several parts of that went unimaginably wrong.  First, the Arab spring failed in Egypt. Nobody with power in the region wanted democracy in Egypt.  Not the Saudis. Not the oil companies.  Not the Egyptian Army.  Not Likud.  They didn't want the Arab Spring in the first place.  The Muslim brotherhood won the elections. But democracy was never their agenda.  So, instead of carefully building up democracy, and the economy, inch-by-inch, they impatiently set their priority on forcing through an Islamic Constitution.  It was incredibly stupid.  It unleashed the Saudi-funded, Likud-complicit, oil-company-desired counter-revolution.  It ended the possibility of western arms, support and funding - not only for democracy in Egypt, but everywhere else the Arab Spring might have taken root - especially Syria.

You have to realize that Cunningham was the hatchet man for the Buffalo Diocese victims of abuse. Naming him a bishop was his reward for his treatment of abuse victims in Buffalo.Thus the Buffalo Diocese brags that it only had 17 pervert priests, what a joke! Buffalo was one of the largest diocese in the country, the number 17 came from the professional liars that have worked for that diocese for decades. Cunningham was one of those liars for Henry Mansell (who later rewarded Cunningham by seeing he was made a bishop). As far as leadership qualities Cunningham has none except that he is an expert liar. I am sure that Cunningham should be more concerned about his own retirement and exit from this Earth. I am sure Satan has reserved a special place for this so called bishop just for his activities in Buffalo.

0,"At times, a location of an accident within a few miles of road construction, traffic bottleneck, or other distraction, can relate to being contributory to the cause. In this instance, the 'mile 99-to-100 construction zone' may have been a factor, which is supposed to help with passing lanes, shoulders, & etc.  http://alaskanavigator.org/projects/seward-highway-mp-99-to-100-improvements  Sometimes people wait until they think they need to pass, instead of finding a safer distraction; one that does not invoke rash destructive results of road warrior gods: mashed guardrail, fenders, rollovers, & mangled lives of occupants.  Later model vehicles with additional safety factors, side air bags help. So do slower travel speeds. Safe a life, a gallon of fuel, & learn to swerve. Take to the bank, not the center channel...  Driving fast only brings more federal highway funds; or 'over-reach' for some drivers. And no photo radar on the hills to reward your best survival skills: with a citation.

Note that when the Second Amendment was written, every weapon was a weapon of war, there were no restrictions on the private ownership of weapons and the militia was equally matched with the regulars. For instance, I’ve never seen it said that the regulars could carry 30 lead balls but the militia could only carry 15. After all, if they weren’t equally matched, it would be pretty hard to deter or prevent a “misconstruction or abuse, of the government’s powers” - so in reality, the citizen militia of today should have the same firearms as the current US military.

If people do not like a particular grocer or retailer, they can simply shop at another store.  Competition between grocers or retailers keep prices low.  That is not the case when it comes to an asset like an airport.  People can't simply switch to use another airport if they do not like a particular one.  That is the distinction between assets which provide essential services where the public would not be well served when it belongs in privatized hands.

Hopefully, the goal is to eliminate the obvious suppression tactics and to get more eligible people to cast votes and participate in the process. Now, that would be fair.

Women need to be encouraged (in any number of ways) by others to enter these areas.  The first two are entirely false.  The third is party true, but I'd quickly add, maybe--just maybe--women don't WANT to be scientists (or engineers, or lawyers.)  Just as some men don't want to be.  So...we have to MAKE them want it?

The merger wasn't a big deal for the member churches, apart from the fact nobody likes change.  If we have a recession and giving drops off, change will be implemented to reduce costs.

0,"In answer to your second question, it represents, sadly, the legacy of a suspicious, paranoid and combative ecclesial mindset which, traditionally, had seen the world more as innately hostile territory than sacred ground for dialogue and for mutual learning,  The high watermark of this reactionary mindset was the publication, in 1864, of the Syllabus of Errors, Pope Pius 1X's rearguard action against the encroachments of modernism. That tide began to ebb really with the Second Vatican Council.  Yves Congar was fortunate (or unfortunate...depending on your point of view) to have been born  between these events. Fortunate to have been able to express and teach a progressive theology against a backdrop of arch-theological conservatism; unfortunate in that the personal cost of this was the misunderstanding and defaming of a brilliant and prophetic mind.

Flynn could be innocent of anything illegal, sure. Maybe he's not. Depending on the outcome and the additional information found out it could potentially indict president Trump if he knew of anything illegal Flynn had done and then actively tried to block the investigation because of it. At the very least for a sitting president to take the actions he did shows hypocrisy, dishonesty, and poor judgement. It's indefensible on principle. 3. In one breath you say the constitution is important to uphold, and then in the next breath you decide to turn a blind eye to a foreign government actively trying to sway our democracy (collusion or not).

Add in that he has been elected specifically to dismantle or at least geld the vast administrative state and you should be able to understand the Deep State will be his opposition rather than a state apparatus at his disposal. Even without specific """"examples"""", it is enough to know that for every Yates and Comey there are hundreds of Obama (and even Bush43) appointees still about who will use every measure available to resist Trump's policies. The US administrative state has been politicized and thinks it has a veto over the democratic choice of the voters. Dangerous.

0,"I _would_ submit that the disparity about the _type_ of force is indicative of a racial bias, though. It's not proof, but once force is used it's usually non-whites getting tasered. To me that does suggest a bias worth more investigation.  To your point, something I'd like to see is the offence that the inmates are in for and see how that breaks down along racial lines. In other words, are non-white folks in jail for violent crimes more often than white folks? If so that would suggest a correlation between violent crimes and use of force -- people who commit violence are more likely to be targets of force in jail. Then it becomes a question of """"why are non-whites getting convicted for violent crimes disproportionately?"""" which then may lead to other questions: arrest rates, propensity to commit types of crimes, etc.  So, yes: definitely clouds of smoke, but we haven't pinpointed the fire quite yet.

0,"Health care providers are able to hide prices and quality of outcomes, making it difficult or impossible to price shop for care, which is already difficult when you are ill and needing care now, not later. Thus, free market pricing is not able to work and prices are set higher than they would be otherwise.  The AMA and universities control the number of doctors which can be trained and licensed in the U.S., so demand is outstripping supply. We are importing doctors and shifting duties from doctors to less skilled personnel, but it is not enough to cover the demand from baby boomers needing more high quality care. As demand outstrips supply, prices go up.  Finally, Americans love our habits. Drinking, smoking, drugs, overeating, lack of exercise, and extramarital sex contribute greatly to 9 of the 10 most costly areas of medical expense, over $1 Trillion, and we want others to pay for it. Until we have to pay for our own choices, we’ll continue our habits.  We need to fix all three.

Both QC and NFLD passed constitutional amendments to remove the requirement from their provincial documents, and then argued provincial jurisdiction to avoid the federal requirements under s 93.  It wasn't that they didn't have them at all, but that they removed them themselves.  So, AB, SK and ON could do the same if they had enough support in the province to do so.  AB's got the second highest rate for non-believers in the country behind BC, so it's hard to believe they couldn't pass an amendment, but SK and ON are a lot more religious, as a whole.

0,"So your solution is that insurance companies, who provide nothing in the way of good, efficient healthcare, get to keep profiting off of our healthcare needs. But the people that actually deliver healthcare, the doctors, nurses, specialists and everyone else that spent 6 to 8 years being educated and trained on how to deliver good sound healthcare, they're the ones that need to take the big cut to make it work?  Good grief...I have no problem with doctors, PAs, Nurse Practitioners and other healthcare professionals making a profit off my healthcare needs. But I do have a problem with the insurance company CEO and all the people underneath him or her, people who contribute nothing to my healthcare needs, skimming so much of every healthcare dollar.  Jeez dude, private insurance industry profits are the primary reason we have the most inefficient healthcare system in the world. That you don't see that...well its just stunning.

0,"The only possible way that I can say the cardinals questions are not a matter of faith is give up belief that Jesus is God.  Why?  Because Jesus himself  discussed this subject and gave certain answers. If it was not a matter of faith why did he address it.   Was he merely confused as to the importance of the subject.  Basically, I would be required to confess that Jesus was merely a man who was confused as God's agenda, not God himself revealing his will.  So you see this silence of the Pope's strikes at the very heart of faith, the most important teaching of Christianity in fact:  The Blessed Trinity.

What is novel now is that those opinions are no longer being dismissed. He was not a widely respected man in his own time, but his image was brushed up by the Orange Lodge, his allies, and Tories who had few successes, and later by a need to emulate the worship of founders in other countries.  He was an embarrassment to the country, then as now, and it is claiming otherwise that is revisionism.

In a very short time we are approaching 250K....The worrysome part is a runaway population that is encroaching upon a ever shrinking landbase.  Exponential poulation growth on a shrinking landbase equates to madness in my books.  A short term fix is to allow the complete redevelopment of the 60.s development that went unfetter for decades.  That is the redevelopment of the single family homes into multi famiy units.  By doing so we give ourselves a few more decades to sort the mess out of us pushing forever out into the greenspace.   I believe this is the only true fix.. the density issue now confronting us in the established area must change.  This is momumental, but must be done.  If the politicians can actually make this work it will be magic.  I am writing this as I drive past two 5000 sq ft homes daily down my street that house a total of 3 people.

The courts in this case said nothing about those laws being unconstitutional per Marbury.  Regarding Korematsu, that executive order (by a liberal Democrat) applied to U.S. citizens and was clearly abridging their rights. Mr. Trump's order applies to non-citizens. Those already in the U.S. certainly have some grounds for redress, but not based on Korematsu, as no one has been interred. Those who are not in the country have no rights under our constitution, yet the courts ruled as if they do. That amounts to making law, not upholding existing law as the judiciary is charged to do.

Today liberals whine pointlessly about white supremacy  despite the fact that very very few Americans are negatively impacted by it compared for example to the barbaric criminal justice system which allows no redemption and locks humans in cages and labels them for life for pretty trivial things.

I see people texting (the rapid switch of focus from the crotch to what's going on in front of them and back again), people making other than hands-free calls on their cell phones, people busting through intersections on lights already turned red, and all manner of other dangerous infractions.

While it is easy, and correct, to designate Trump as the Liar-in-Chief, I think he is better understood as the Bullsh*****-in-Chief."""" Several years ago, Harry G. Frankfurt published a book-length essay, """"On Bullsh*t"""", in which he distinguishes between a liar and a bullsh*****, A liar knows the truth and is deliberately trying to communicate a falsehood. A bullsh***** neither knows nor cares what the truth is; he says only what he thinks serves his purpose in the moment. Trump knows, believes and cares about very little, other than about Donald J. Trump; he just conjures up bull in the moment. Consider the nonsense he is sending his team of liars out to try to diffuse the despicable lie about Obama wiretapping him. Imagine: Trump called Obama a """"bad (or sick) guy""""! Trump is a filthy, reckless, dangerous man. Not normal!

It is a well established fact that men and women's brains are wired differently. I suspect the much higher rate of autism in men versus women (5 to 1) is a result of the same type of brain wiring that gives men an advantage in math. That doesn't mean women cannot be good mathematicians, but the odds are better a man will be than a woman. Instead of trying to pound square pegs into round holes lets just accept that men and women can and do have different areas of excellence. And there are exceptions to all rules.  As for women in tech companies - the track record for women as CEOs in tech is abysmal. Is that because they are not suited for the job or because the male culture sabotages them?

He promised that nothing would stop him from providing healing resolution and fair compensation to those who have been hurt so deeply. Nothing stopped him alright! Listecki immediately spent millions to have every victims claim thrown out. Listecki stated that not even one claim had merit. He put us through 5 years of hell. Turns out his promises for healing and fairness were a pre-planned bait and switch with his goal to wipe out as many victims as possible at once.

On the other hand - adding a rainwater harvesting system to my home is something I can do, it's a practical step I can take to help make things better - for everybody because by using more rainwater myself it means less damwater used - which means more for other people.

0,"The City probably figures that underestimating rail costs and overestimating ridership balances out in the end.  Ridership on the San Juan rail was so low that fares were reduced to ZERO in order to get ridership up, yet the ridership continued to remain way below what had been estimated.  Since fares cover only part of rail's operating costs, underestimating ridership for Honolulu's rail means that the already large subsidy that will be required to operate it will have to be increased even more.  The City's only source of this kind of big money is the property tax, but Caldwell has said that he doesn't want to use it for rail.  The GET surcharge is the only realistic alternative, so Oahu residents should be prepared to pay it forever.  Of course, that obviates any increase in the GET for improving the quality of education, protecting the environment, or anything else that is important to people.

This is a far cry from what Simon Reismon lead negotiatot or Alan Gotlieb, Canadian Ambassador to the US wanted.

It is majority owned by Dan Sullivan's family, and they make the stuff from dirty oil, and that is why they want the Keystone XL pipeline so bad, so they can make big profits off cheap dirty oil, and the burning of fuels so they can get more cheap by products.  That's how Dan Sullivan is in bed with Koch Industries.  All this Religious pandering stuff is just lip service to get what they want, which Is POWER !!!!!  De-friend conservatives on social media!

0,"I take no exception to Ms Aziz's contention that western foreign policy regarding the middle east is an underlying cause of, or is at the root of,  much of what we call terrorism against the west.  Brutal and self-interested foreign policy tends to result in blow-back over time. The West's biggest effort should be focused on extricating itself from entanglements in the vicious affairs of the middle east  However, I do take exception to her contention that  """"Nobody in this country tolerates extremists, other than extremists.""""...it is obvious from the large number of individuals who have been targeted for monitoring due to evidence of sympathy to extremist causes and then subsequently removed from monitoring due to lack of evidence of direct involvement in planning any action, that extremism has a sizable and largely tolerant sympathetic following....if she demands honesty from her government and the West regarding the roots of terrorism, she should also demand it from herself

0,"Some use the 5th commandment as a rationale for abolishing the death penalty, and there can be reasonable consent that society should be guided by this admonition, except that in just war and self defense, it isn't.  Blanket capital punishment is clearly unwarranted in most cases, and there is much to argue against in executing someone who has languished in jail for a protracted number of years.  And so, there are many openings for assent and dissent.  But a society must recognize the hierarchical distinctions in both evil and good, and agree to lawful regulation flowing from these discrepancies.  Exceptions must be made in punishing offenders.  In fact, there has always been a universal response to certain forms of human behavior.  In another world, we called it natural law.  The State has the right and duty to punish by execution crimes that are beyond the pale.  A Charles Mansen should never have been allowed to live.  He and others like him remain the exceptions.

0,"I should also add on a personal note that fasting truly is a humbling tool to highlight my own inequity. Especially for people like me that live in an affluent western country. Fasting enforces the empathy for those that are forced to fast out of impoverished circumstances by feeling true hunger and denial of wants, at least when following the preconcilar fast.  It makes almsgiving  and charity that much more personal when I realise how much I have been given, from others and God, and how much I squander, during fasting St Basil the Great's homily against the rich and selfish rings true in my own life, as my affluency when not shared with others, is theft against the poor. It also magnifies St John the Baptist's words of how we must decrease in order to bring greater glory to Christ our Lord.  I wish the great spiritual gift of ascetic praxis was not hidden away in the corners of the Latin Church, for me it is a gift that begets many gifts.

There will be solid clique with a strangle hold on innovation of progress and new fresh people will be shunted tone side and used if valuable or ignored and rejected. The entire structure will collapse on to itself amidst great recriminations and drama.  Would this happen with a men's group? Of course it could and has over the years, but with less regularity. Why less often? Because many successful men are dorks and social misfits and other men are used it and expect it and plan accordingly. There is none of this """"magic"""" or """"bonding"""" that is supposed to happen in women's groups. Men fully expect to be screwed over and behave accordingly.  The major problem is goals.

Perhaps Flemming saw a Zoo plan used as a doorstop and actually picked it up to look at it.

For example, if you read columnists and news reports regarding Charlottesville, you will see stories suggesting that Trump supported """"white supremacists.""""

The Great Hall project will actually move the area on the 5th level of the main terminal behind security, and turn it into a shopping and dining hall.

With all of that space that's currently used for the overcrowded security checkpoints and the overcrowded ticket counters the idea of compressing those two things into a smaller space on the 6th floor is ridiculous.  Plus, one of the nice things about DIA vs. other airports I have used is that there are some decent choices for restaurants outside of security in the Great Hall.  This allows friends and family members to spend some time with their loved ones before they leave on flights.

Subsequently it will not publish a National Statistic that is a consumer price series with an accounting approach to measuring owner-occupied housing (OOH) costs. The UK was the only other country that ever took this approach to measuring OOH besides Canada. Regardless, the Bank of Canada has shown a dog-like loyalty to the approach. A 2009 study by Richard Dion and Patrick Sabourin, showed that the much superior net acquisitions approach generated an index that was also easier to forecast, just the sort of result one would think would impress Poloz.

It goes against the Catholicity of the Church, a core characteristic of Catholicism. If you don’t care what God is doing in the world, you don’t care much about God. If you see God in action, you should be thrilled. Indifference only means you are closed off. Faith appears very small in the way you present it.

There was no mention of the ORIGINAL FULL amount of OUR PFD's before Bill Walker stole it and slashed OUR PFD's.

Why was the full original amount concealed and unaccounted for by the Permanent Fund Dividend Division?

They drafted M97 intentionally to be obscure and difficult to understand. And they did it for very cynical reasons: a regular sales tax would never pass, and an increase in the corporate income tax would have to be so large it would immediately expose the gigantic size of the tax increase. I will keep reminding people that M97 is a trojan horse.  And one more point: why did the authors have to try to solve decades of school underfunding in one extreme tax increase? Why couldn't they propose something more moderate, more fair?  Now, the sponsors' credibility is on the line. If it  fails, they will have great difficulty coming back and trying again.

With the (unfortunately) likely loss by Bernie Sanders in the still-to-be-decided Democratic primary, Donald Trump is the only outsider candidate. I think it's quite clear that Americans want change, we want an outsider, we want someone who will challenge the status quo.

The remaining funds could have build tens of thousands of housing units, fixed our highways (anyone driven on the Pali recently?), and fixed our sewers and public schools.  Instead our inept lawmakers channeled more billions of dollars without requiring a forensic audit before the funding was approved.

They should, technically, love her and the party knows it.  After Trump has gone fully overboard before the elections and then appeals only to wild-eyed radicals, you're going to see a considerable number of votes cross over to ol' Republican Lite Hillary over Crazy Trump.

0,">> “If one presumes that the voter is duty bound [sic] to the public, and >> not beholden to his own personal beliefs and interests, there should >> be no problem in this vote being conducted in public.”    The above quote sums up the average ANC cadre’s schizophrenic relationship with reality and truth.  On the one hand, Molewa wants its MPs to toe the party line (in order to protect both a faux image of unity and a sorely corrupt leadership), while on the other hand pretending that it’s the voter’s duty to be altruistic in defending the public interest.  The fly in the ointment, dear minister, is that your organisation has consistently failed the public interest and you have done nothing concrete to address this failure.

This process is not a reenactment thing. It uses REM sleep eye movements, or left right stimuli, like vibrating paddles, to work on the emotional disruption that trauma brings to our life. To let you know how well it works, go out and take a 20 minute walk in the fresh air, or at least imagine/visualize it. How does that feel, eh? You just used left right stimuli (walking) to help relieve your stress. This process works, and you don't need to take pills.

0,"This CO2 heat pump system, which I designed, is performing with a total system COP of 2.2 to 3.0... this means that for every unit of electrical energy into pumps & compressors, 2.2 to 3.0 units of heat energy are produced.  One half to two thirds of the heat energy produced is simply being moved from the ocean, which receives heat from the sun.  About one third of the energy of the total produced is grid electricity consumed to run the loop pumps,  compressors and controls.  Grid electricity in Seward is purchased from Chugach Electric Association and it is about 15% renewable hydro and 85% natural gas.  Of the total heat produced from the CO2 system, about 70% is coming from renewable sources (ocean heat + hydro power) and about 30% from natural gas generated electricity.  All of the heat at the Center used was previously produced by oil boilers =100% fossil fuel.  The reduction in total carbon emissions due to the heat pump systems vs. old oil boilers is about 80% = significant.

As long as we have one homeless child on the streets of this country, going to bed hungry or simply in fear of where their next meal, or a roof over their head is going to come from, then I would wish that the funds that might be spent on helping those from other nations, be focused on our already struggling, marginalized, poor.

0,"My reference to Bill Clinton wasn't in the context of the election. It was in the context of discussing an article about 'rape culture.' In a separate message, I stated my belief that his past affairs should have no bearing on considering Hillary for the presidency.  But I must offer one correction to your message. Bill's history with philandering had already come out before he was elected president and was, in fact, a major issue in the 1992 campaign. It was the Gennifer Flowers allegations that prompted Bill and Hillary's appearance on 60 Minutes to do damage control.

The main topic of debate, until modern science, was when ensoulment occured.  But that's a theological debate, not based on science.  Having no knowledge of DNA, or embryology, people have always debated abortion.  Gastrulation is a phase early in the embryonic development of most animals during which the single-layered blastula is reorganized into a trilaminar (three-layered) structure known as the gastrula. The term was invented in 1872.  Gastrulation occurs around day 15 following conception, well before a woman will know she's pregnant.  So you don't believe in abortion then? There is no scientific basis for the notion that the """"mother's DNA guides development until gastrulation.""""  It doesn't occur in an ovum for example.  The DNA from both parents is utilized at all stages of existence.  Science says human life begins at conception.

I'm a strong transit advocate but I agree that the FHWA's unwillingness to allow """"pass-through"""" of the westbound HOV for SOV's from Island Crest Way is a big problem that probably doesn't need to exist.  Those cars merge safely into the existing lanes from the left and can probably be accommodated in volume by the R8A lane.  So, here's hoping that a waiver is granted, but if it is not Metro needs to step up and offer frequent rush hour service on a resuscitated 202 and even a few runs on the old 201 route.  Depending on the loop the loop using North Mercer Way and the 76th SE on-ramp will cause significant delays; there's no way that won't happen.  I expect that most drivers heading west from Mercer Island during the morning peak are headed for somewhere in downtown Seattle or SLU, so extending the 202 at least to SLU would also be a good idea.

What qualifies as “behaving strangely” to equate to “possible criminal activity” Why a high speed chase at night in an area where there is “lots of pedestrian traffic”?

0,"Yes, the problem with your analogy is that it is not the one used by Christ for the Eucharist.  In the gospels, Christ refers to the Eucharist as body, bread, flesh, blood.  I cannot find any reference to fruits, and I cannot find him saying that his own sexuality is essential for the Eucharist.  I cannot find any such teaching in the Trent definition, or in the CCC, or in the TOB.  In the TOB, Part I is a general theological anthropology that applies to humanity in general, and therefore to all the sacraments.  Part II is the application to the sacrament of marriage, but this does not mean that Part I is not applicable to the other sacraments.  If you really believe, with certainty of faith, that maleness is intrinsic to priesthood, you may be a victim of the vexing conflation of patriarchal sex/gender theory with our current sacramental theology.  Sorry, but I DO NOT believe, with certainty of faith, that Jesus' maleness is essential for the redemption, let alone the priesthood.

Don't ask me, I don't give a damn, next stop is Iran and Rocket Man And it's five, six, seven, open up the pearly gates Well there ain't no time to wonder why Whoopee! we're all gonna die. .

0,"The history of war mongering rhetoric from all countries involved has lead me to adopt a stance that even I find repugnant. This requires a policy of no aid in any way shape or form to the country of North Korea, as well as strong discouragement of any country that attempts such aid. Every outreach of food, medical, and/or financial aid towards North Korea has brought us to where we are today. It would be difficult to watch a starving man die, but it becomes a touch easier when every time you help that man, he gets healthy, blames you for all of his problems, and threatens to blow up your house again. If you look at every cent put towards maintaining health of the North Korean population resulting in the reward of the North Korea regime being able to allocate more resources towards a nuclear weapons program, the idea of letting a person sleep in the bed they have made for themselves should become easier.

0,"Certain leftwing groups want to obliterate our past cultures that founded and built North American/European society. What are the most favourable societies to live in on this globe? North American and European. What describes the values, mores, inventive thought, philosophical thought, visions that built our wonderful societies? Literature from our past. No society should forget its roots and erase its history, but that is what is being demanded of our British/European roots. Literature allows students to examine our evolution of thought and values, discuss human nature and time periods. It is scandalous that our leftwing governments, and educational institutions are at the forefront of dismantling our past because they have some moronic need to appease some minority groups who seek these capitulations, not for the benefit of our societies, but for the goal of destruction and therefore the achievement of a sense of power. They simply want to exercise power over the majority.

Of course open honest communication and maybe some counseling can be very helpful. His girlfriend has an opportunity to clear the air here and I hope she takes it. But I have  two minor insights: one, I know at least two men, exes, who stayed friends with their exes for years hoping it would turn back into love. Two: maturity. Do these people know themselves? Have they been around a time or two and know what makes life worthwhile? Or are they still forming who they are through their friendships and experiences? If so- maybe she doesn't know what she wants and the LR has every right to question this situation.

Or, with Hillary and the female legislator, is their behavior more of frustration, then being unstable. If so, then why isn't Trump granted the same leeway. A President can't be frustration, especially when he does what the media ask, and got zip, zero, credit for it.  The media what him to single out, and Trump did, and the media ignore it.

Married men who get divorced, on the other hand, are among the most miserable, and the most likely to commit suicide.  As men, we see what happens when a man gets divorced.  Better to be stable and single than divorced, economically devastated and suicidal.  Considering the stats on the chances of divorce, there's a reason that there's a growing movement for men to abandon marriage in all but extraordinary circumstances because of this risk.
