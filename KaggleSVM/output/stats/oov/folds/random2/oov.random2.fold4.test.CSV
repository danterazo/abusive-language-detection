0,"If you have kids you probably knew that child benefits just barely cover all previously cancelled benefits and kids related tax benefits, it could be a  difference of a couple hundreds no more. I may explain you why families with kids should have privileges, because when you and me retire, someone needs to pay taxes to cover all federal services. An alternative to growing own kids is to bring more immigrants to replace aging population, which has its own cost. Regarding a single parent family, I wouldn't mind to introduce some kind of  an income split as well, that would be fair to me.

0,"This is a repeat historically of how anti-semitism develops.  Other oppressed people (think Russian and Polish peasants) earlier in history participated in pogroms against Jews in order to vent about and """"remedy"""" (as if) their own history of oppression and oppressed state.  But this was convenient for the ruling powers and classes to escape responsibbility and blame  It was easier to blame the Jews.  Same with racial oppression and lynchings of blacks by poor whites (see Bob Dylan's """"Only a pawn in their game"""")  All the participants in this game of needless, wasteful, immoral hatred of anti-semitism (and anti-Arsian sentiment) are being manipulated by the powers that be.  We all of us --African Asian, Jew CHristian Muslim -- are being split apart when we should be united, together.  Alas human nature -- such a shame

0,"Certainly some of the things the Koch brothers have done and donated to are worthy of admiration...and after the Citizen's United decision by the Supremes, both parties are in the pockets of big money. But most of what the Koch's have done with their right wing libertarian agenda is not good, and not admirable... read """"Dark Money"""" by Mayer, for a good summary. In particular, their efforts to perpetuate our fossil fuel based economy, from which most of their great wealth is based, in the face of overwhelming evidence of what emissions are doing to our environment is despicable.

It is harder to overlook someone saying the would bang their own daughter, and really hard to explain how you would vote for someone that would """"grab them by the p***y"""".

"
0,"Good for you (seriously). However, we have a fundamental difference of opinion. An essential problem for C corporations right now is that these corporations have a fiduciary duty to increase value for shareholders. This has largely been interpreted as a reason to prioritize short term profit taking, even at the expense of long-term goals. Which means that C corps will push to decrease taxes, even if it robs them of their ability to compete internationally with companies that have access to better infrastructure and training of employees. So, yes, profit is good is capital can be used in all sorts of beneficial ways. But, like all things, there is a balance point where the marginal utility of new profit is less valuable than government investments. We apparently disagree on that balance point, which is fine.  I am happy to pay my taxes. But of course I want a general agreement and participation by all. I wouldn't ask you to forgo all government services if you want a smaller government.

"
0,"Hitler's speeches have been posted all across the Internet for years now, and reading them  reveals to the casual observer that he was really a socialist. His rhetoric is fully recognizable. It reminds us that Marx included national socialism (seen in German Nazism) as one of seven forms of socialism.  Nazism's association with the right  is the result of post-war efforts by communist parties around the globe to sever any connection between communism and Nazism, lest all forms of socialism are associated with Hitler's atrocities. This campaign was initiated on orders from Josef Stalin, who worried incessantly that his efforts to advance international communism would be scuttled by accusations with Nazism.  Hitler's long-term alliance with fascist Mussolini made that campaign all the more successful, and enabled the rise of the term """"fascist"""" as applied to the right. But the dirty truth is that Nazism is the unwanted step-child to socialism and belongs to the left and not to the right.

"
0,"Sorry, but those ideas are only for those who really don't know Church history.  First of all Vatican II is a real bona-fide ecumenical council.  It has more authority than any pope alone.  This is because the bishops of the world---who are the successors to the apostles VOTE on documents proposed there.  NO pope has a right to repudiate any ecumenical council.  But JP II and Benedict XVI did their best to circumnavigate the V II.  That's not fake-history.  Pope Francis is bringing back many of the Constitutions and Decrees of Vatican II which were 'side-stepped'.  It's a good thing that there is a written history of not only the documents passed at Vatican II but also copies of all the debate and discussion on the floor of the council---that gives 'flesh' to what was passed.

There's history going clear back to the 40s regarding erosion control in that river.When my husband was working in Seward and we considered homes, as buyers we were provided with all the information regarding a property including flood plain information. We had to weigh the possible repercussions and ended up turning down the house. Six months later the entire neighborhood was predictably under water according to the flood plain info we were given.  It may be another 50 years before it floods again, but I still wouldn't buy it and hope that's true. I can only imagine that considering the area, any homeowner purchasing along the river was given similar info regarding the river and its erosion issues. Yet they chose to build or purchase. It's not a freak accident. It's a natural function of the river going back decades. Why should anyone else have to pony up to pay the bill now as they fall into the river

There are numerous intrusions of marine sediments found inland, in areas like Lagoon Creek (10 miles S of Crescent Bay), by geologists.  Between liquefaction of the near shore areas and possible damage from a wave or surge, PA will probably sustain major damage . Layers of marine sediments, indicating tsunamis have been found in the many areas along the Strait.  The tribal village of  Tse-whit-zen, in what is now PA, may provide evidence of  past tsunamis. Archaeological evidence shows the village site being abandoned every few hundred years. Interesting information with possible relevance for our future.

Over time, with the US supported Taiwan has solidified into a artificial separate sovereignty, though not recognized by the international community. For good or bad, the trend is that the dynamic authoritarian Chinese regime will completely reabsorb their lost Hong Kong and Taiwan. Does US intervention in this Chinese process serve any benefit to international relations and conflict resolution? That's the important question.

Too often, the burden (and joy) of caregiving for a sick family member falls to the woman, who these days more often than not, is also working.  Whereas those with the financial means can afford to engage third party caregivers to assist in the home, those who cannot have to leave their jobs and more often than not find that when the family member dies that the door to re- employment has closed for a middle aged women. The woman is left without the family member, without a job and often struggles financially. With a spouse with Alzheimer's, she could be caregiving for an average of ten years.  If Ms Raitt is able to arrange for her husband's care, I see no reason for her to give up her own life.

All based on taxpayer money and corporate demands.  Not considered because most politicians are more concerned with their next fundraising event,  is that the labour oversupply is killing off the economy in the long term and impoverishing the next generation, the  profits are privately held at the top and not recirculated in the economy so there is no trickle down, it has created low wage service sector jobs that do not create taxes, and the higher populations get a social benefit system that creates an ever larger drain on the taxpayers which will never end (deficits forever).  The only answer is to adjust immigration so there is maximum benefit to the taxpayer, not maximum cost which is where we are headed.

There are exceptions, especially in 3-4 teams, but the majority of ELITE edge rushers are 245-275 pounds, and virtually ALWAYS beat the tackle w/speed moves, using technique over weight and brawn. I just wonder if any team is going to adjust to their giants consistently getting out-quicked.

0,"Perhaps Alaska should consider a ban on people who oppose responsible development?  OK - OK - people have a right to express their opinion - even if they are misguided.  Yes, yes, we (writ large) need to come to terms with climate change.  But doing so in an economically irresponsible way will actually make the problem worse, not better.  The market is the best mechanism to decide if development is warranted?  IF we shift how we get energy, demand for oil will (or at least could) decline.  Development in Alaska is not cheap, nor is moving product from Alaska.  The market will stop development first - witness BP's decisions - if and when that is actually appropriate.  Imposing a ban by fiat is lousy policy.

Draw a horizontal line 400 miles north of Canada's border with the USA. That horizontal strip of land, coast to coast, is where about 90 percent of Canadians live and includes most of our cities.  And in that strip of land where most of us live, in terms of geography and population density, we are very comparable to the USA.  And so your argument is not compelling.  The USA has lots of big northern cities (Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Boston) and, for each of those cities, a blue collar worker in town can drive to a neighbourhood half an hour away and find dozens of houses for sale for less than 400k. Even a half hour drive from Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan.  Good luck finding such houses a half hour drive from Vancouver General Hospital. They do not exist.

While construction was stopped and until it was completed, taxpayers were paying interest on the substantial sums already invested - interest payments which were entirely unnecessary except for political diddling.  As well, Hydro was directed to speed up construction to minimize the time to in-service.

0,"Keith Muschinske, whether we should or shouldn't have used atomic weapons on two Japanese cities takes a distant second place to the fact that it happened, and the fact that it happened has largely shaped our concept of deterrence, and many of the dynamics of the Cold War.  The real question, at least to me, is the concept of attacking civilian populations along with military installations, with the flimsy justification that """"they did it too.""""  Or with the dubious conclusion of weakening their """"will to war.""""  It's said that all war is war on women and children.  We'd already decided to fire-bomb German and Japanese cities as a means to weaken civilian support for the war effort; even though by this time that population was subject to the military, not the other way around.  The real validity of Hiroshima is that there are still people willing to use nuclear weapons on civilians to achieve military goals---Do we want to be among them?

0,"If the city of Eugene really wants to put a big dent in crime and improve the lives of its citizens, it is much wiser to spend this money to house homeless people and the poor as many housing first programs around the country have had great success. If this money was spent to help the homeless and poor people, there would be no need for this police station.  Clearly the Eugene city council has no comprehension of the misery that its many poor and homeless people endure.  One thing that this money could be spent on is building little houses.  This would benefit the city in many ways:  it would put many to work, it would improve the public/police relations and trust, it would allow these poor and homeless people to improve their lives tremendously, it would instantly lower the city's crime rate....  If this police station is built, it will only make the problems worse for the city of Eugene, and make its people distrust its governors and police even more.

0,"A moonshiner will sometimes add some methanol to the product to increase the kick.  This is much cheaper than increasing the percentage of ethanol.  Even a slight miscalculation can cause the users to go blind or die.  If  this happens the moonshiner will be charged with some pretty serious crimes including murder and manslaughter so most moonshiners do not adulterate their product.  For some reason, when an illegal drug supplier adds fentanyl to their product and people die, they are not held to the same standard.  Low level street dealers are typically not even charged with an offence, and simply have their wares seized and destroyed.  If someone dies or overdoses from fentanyl contaminated drugs, the dealers should be immediately arrested and charged with manslaughter or murder.  They will immediately roll over and rat out their suppliers and so on.  If the police and justice system were serious about stopping the overdose crisis, they would start rounding up the low level dealers.

0,"The good news - this is effectively a two year deal. The bad news - it is essentially swapping a 32 year old Millsap for 28 year old Gallinari. Those two players had nearly identical stats last season. The Nuggets remain a team that will be chasing the 8th seed and with it a mid first round draft pick. Not that it really matters, since the Nuggets have to spend the money anyway, but I suspect they overpaid. I don't think there were any other serious bidders for Millsap.

Without addressing the source little to no progress will be made.  Read the Bible and the Koran and you will find that they are filled with hate speech. This is the well spring from which the far right derives its justification for heinous acts of violence.  Unfortunately in west religion is protected and untouchable.

Yes, more fatally injured drivers are testing positive, but testing has gone up and the studies reporting these positives are quick to point out that cannabis is detectable for days or weeks following ingestion and that the positives do not indicate that the motorists were impaired or even blameworthy for the accidents that killed them. Nor is there any evidence that usage rates have gone up where cannabis has been legalized.  Cannabis is an economic substitute for alcohol, so when cannabis use goes up, drinking and DUI accidents go down.  ER """"mentions"""" and poison control calls have gone up, in whole or in part where cannabis has been legalized because people in those jurisdictions are not as afraid to mention cannabis. Dutch consumers, for example, are more candid than Filipino consumers about cannabis, because Filipino consumers face extrajudicial death squads.

0,"Donald Trump’s speech in Poland may have attempted to camouflage its Fascist undertones with some Nazi-bashing, but no one will be fooled. The speech was probably shaped by alt-Neo-Nazi Steve Bannon, White House strategist and enabler of the white supremacist roll of toilet paper known as Breitbart. Like all Fascist speeches, it configured the Fatherland as weak and a laughingstock, threatened imminently with being wiped out. It is this paranoia and poor self-image that drives Fascist aggression. Above all, Trump upholds the values of fear, timidity and paranoia. A small radical fringe in the Muslim world cannot menace America’s civilization. But a far right white nationalist president with serious mental issues can.

This is not meant to favor abortion, but, in some cases, and depending upon very-individual circumstances, it may be the best option.  Back in the pre-Roe days, unwanted children were sent to homes, where they were mistreated, and sometimes sent to foster homes, where they were equally mistreated.  If a baby wasn't perfect in every way, it generally went unadopted.  I remember when pregnant girls used to be sent to Excelsior Home for Wayward Girls.  (It's called a """"youth center"""" today.  Boys tried to break in.)  Many wayward girls were sent to convents to have their babies among the nuns.

Why should an $80K car not cost 4 times as much to insure as a $20K car? Cars that are more likely to be stolen should also cost more to insure in proportion to their likelihood of being stolen. Cars that are heavier should cost more to insure because they will do more damage if they hit something else.  And start pulling more licenses for dangerous driving, distracted driving, speeding, unsafe lane changes etc. - increase the fines, especially for second offences and use the $ to hire more traffic cops.

So while it obviously might look like a President is trying to obstruct justice by firing the FBI Director who is investigating the President's associates , and he very likely was, it might be difficult to prove obstruction of justice from a legal standpoint for firing someone that you can legally fire for any reason someone made up these rules..I'm assuming it was Congress...maybe Congress needs to rein in the President's power... because if the rules are not changed, then what this comes down to is attempting to determine the intention of a President, rather than the specific actions of a President....and it seems to me that any President, not just the ones everyone hates, should only be held legally accountable for what they illegally do, not for what they legally do with likely self serving intent

Will the future lies be enough to send American kids off to die in foreign lands while acting as security guards for Trumps billionaire cabinet's terrorist creating foreign investments that we invade and occupy for?

What I find interesting is that in the descriptions of Wynne's new plan, there's no mention of whether these people get to keep their basic personal exemption, since it exists for the same purpose, to acknowledge that people at the bottom need a starting point before their income is taxed. If they're receiving a guaranteed income, they're already got that starting point and a basic personal exemption is redundant.  It's also interesting to note another article in the last couple days that points out that the basic personal exemption in 1917 when income tax was first introduced is about 25,000 for a single in today's dollars, and almost 50,000 for a family.  So here's a plan with real numbers to integrate guaranteed income with income tax (often referred to as negative tax).

0,"Okay, wait a minute. with the average wage and employee count listed, Broadcom will generate a payroll of about $13.5 million dollars per year.  All of that money will flow directly into our local economy from Broadcom's worldwide sales.  In addition to the payroll, Broadcom will suck down EWEB's power, of which EWEB apparently has too much, and help subsidize the utility for the entire Eugene population.  Also, a plant of Broadcom's size will do substantial local purchasing again pouring cash into the local economy.  If Broadcom is successful and profitable, they will likely double or triple their work force (the plant is big enough).  The bigger the workforce the more money their payroll will dump into the local economy.  In a case like this, in comparison to apartment buildings, real estate tax abatement makes sense and comprises the community's investment in a lucrative potentially long term resource.  Plant's like Broadcom provide a pillar of strength if properly nurtured.

When those who, like Pope Francis or Fr.

The Kyoto Protocol was a mirage because some leaders (including the US) made commitments they knew would never be approved/implemented back home.   Even Hillary as President would not have ensured adoption of the Paris Accord in the US....not with the Republicans in power in Congress.  Canada isn't much better... barely spending half of what we committed to supporting NATO.   Why get exercised over who is talking the talk when it's optional (and unlikely) that they'll ever walk the walk?

We've known at least 10 years now, about since the arms deal.  If so many members find the situation untenable and dire, which it is, and cannot change the majority view that's reached moral nadir, they ought to resign from the party and suffer the consequences as the country is doing. That will split the ANC, which already is dead on its feet, and change everything. But, no, they won't and will continue to express loyalty to their dying days. (After 2019 when voters abandon it their loyalty will be moot.) Instead, expect more moralising in DM and elsewhere from members Trevor Manuel, Save SA worthies, et al about where the ANC is going wrong (yawn).

When's the last time Anderson contributed a 100-yard plus running game for Denver? Yeah, last year when he went down again, like the third time in two seasons. The only real contribution Anderson, el fat rato, makes is in pass blocking. He'll stick his nose in the face of an oncoming rusher the way a 12-year-old, freckle-faced bully will throw his weight around the playground. The House of the Horse, though, is no playground, it's a proving ground and when it comes to proving durability and performance, Anderson is a half loaf of day-old bread. We, Denver fans, are tired of the excuses and the missed games. If Anderson can't play, kick him out. We have more able/capable runners.

It could lead to a 3 pronged conflict between the government forces of Assad, the rebels who are fighting to oppose him, and the Kurds wishing to hold on to territories they have liberated from ISIS. Add Turkey in there who is escalating it's defenses against the PKK along it's border with Iraq and you have the makings of a whole new chapter in the regional conflict.

0,"As a farmer, livestock owner, and somewhat educated person... I can say there are many, many ways to improve the farm to table suffering of our animals. 1.  Relax many of the restrictions on abattoirs:  the excessive restrictions have led to the closure of many small butchers, therefore increasing the time animals are spent in transit. 2.  Set a minimum square footage for animals in feedlots.  They are crammed in with no room to move, play, or lay down. 3.  Bring back dairy cattle grazing.  Most dairy cattle never see grass again after their first calving.  They are tied to a metal pole and stand/ lay there for the rest of their milking life. 4. Force veal calve farmers to pen their calves in a paddock where they can at least interact with each other for their short lives. 5.  End caging of laying hens. Like, just end it already.

Or at least, this is what certain posters have maintained for the past few years, that batting order matters, load up the top of your order with your better hitters, like Bautista.

The country was designed by the former regime to serve maybe 6 million souls.

I disagree wholly about legalizing drugs.  We should be encouraging our young and old (and it is amazing the number of old people who think it is cool to get high) to figure out how to live a live without mind altering substances.  (Now, I would add alcohol to that list, but that ship has already sailed.)  Legalization of drugs is just one more thing that will wreck homes, finances, and lives.  There is so much more to life than putting in harmful substances to your body and quite frankly I find it quite sad that people have to live that way.  And unfortunately, for most people, moderation is not something that is in their vocabulary.

0,"I think the Mueller investigation may do exactly that. On the other hand, I think it is likely that Trump will fire Mueller at some point. Mueller seems to be anticipating that and, to the extent that he can, providing for it. I think it is critical to remember that the most important thing separating Trump from all of his predecessors, even the worst of them, is not his corruption, incompetence and instability, though these, too, exceed anything we have heretofore seen or experienced. What really distinguishes Trump from his predecessors is Trump's radical contempt for the United States of America, for its people, values, Constitution, government, institutions and values: none of these things mean anything to Trump, who values first, last and ultimately only Donald J. Trump. Trump must be removed by the process that best lays out the evidence against him, his co-conspirators and enablers. whether that is prosecution or impeachment, I don't know. They are not mutually exclusive.

But like Trudeau, I don't believe they can be bought for $1,500.  Nor do I accept the premise in this article that """"Trudeau’s ministers have been selling exclusive access to themselves at $1,500-a-head"""". Most readers would interpret 'exclusive' to mean one on one face time with the minister.  I fail to see the lure in paying $12 or $1200 for a reception in support of a politician when the presence of the guest of honour is prohibited. Will his chair now be filled with a cut-out of the minister or a stuffed tuxedo?  Clearly there is great naivety when it comes to the business of influence peddling. The process by which politicians are pocketed by big business and special interests is far less obvious but far more insidious.

If our government - Chretien, Martin, Harper - had negotiated compensation at the same time as his repatriation to Canada, there's little doubt the dollar amount would have been way less. His claim under the initial damages suit was for $100,000.  After the 2010 SCC decision confirming that our government had seriously violated his Charter rights, Khadr’s team amended the damage claim, way up – of course they did; they had more evidence, the biggest issue had just been proven, and he had just spent many more years improperly in jail.

Donor progams are simple results-based management things that do not account for the complexity of the political, social an field situations to achieve any economic or governance benefits. Very few aid orgnizations have competent and ethical staff in sufficient number to make serious dents in robust problems in target societies. Just ramping up the aid budget without a different policy reflection on wether it serves Canada and allies' interests is just corpoate welfare to NGOs, UN. What Canada's aid budget buys mostly government propaganda that perpetuates a myth of Canada's importance and good guy image for domestic consumption.

I fully admit that my position on PZA is hypocritical because one's personal opinion of a product really doesn't matter if the general population or a meaningful share of that population doesn't agree.  My rationale for not investing is that compared to others I think the PZA business has a higher risk of future under-performance because of the food.  I don't think it would be hard for a new budget pizza competitor to enter the market or for Dominoes to squeeze PZA's market share.  I own BPF.UN and AW.UN with similar investment structures.  It is about evaluating options and picking the one(s) you feel most comfortable with.  It doesn't mean PZA is a bad investment - just that it doesn't fit my objectives.

I worked out my own equations solving the problem---just a bit of high school algebra---and determined that for the time I was considering delaying  taking CPP----basically until I thought I would stop working ---I would have to live to be 78 for delay to pay off.  I didn't delay since I could use the money for travel at the end of my career and the early years of retirement before the inevitable mobility issues made travel more difficult and  there wouldn't be much point having more CPP per month.

His shot when he shoots is like a wet noodle swimming through milk. Marner's shooting, with his sharp hockey instincts puts him to shame with his half season of experience and Rielly is already playing over 25 minutes per game, which should be the other way around because Gardiner has more experience.

0,"Sociopaths have structural issues. I am not talking about going after-bipolar or schizoprenic patients. Just the sociopaths who have a pattern of violence and will predictably get worse. They need to be separated from society, including institutional society, without fanfare. I am all for taking the guns. The government should quietly buy all ammo and gun store stock and the stores themselves, as well as all gun show inventory. Doing so is no second amendment violation. Prohibit federal contractors from non-government sales and in violent areas, decree weapons as a public safety hazard and enter all homes and seize the weapons without charging the individuals (unless later forensics shows they used them in a crime, then do an MRI to see if they are sociopathic or just desperate. Also, end the drug war and raise the minimum wage to $15, with a $1000 per month per child refundable tax credit.

Let's cram in a bunch more so it becomes the opposite of what it is now."""" ?  As for it being not-in-my-back-yard, the commenter should understand that the Brightwater SEWAGE plant was built in this area and part of the deal for that happening was that a community park would be developed in the area to compensate for that.

1,"Hi, Mary - I had to re-read your comment to understand where you were coming from. If I understand you correctly, you're pointing out that the document to which Michael refers (Gaudium et Spes) suffers from the sexism of its time, and therefore requires correction if the Church is going to credibly proclaim the Gospel to the people of our day, and especially if the Church is going to mount real resistance to the Trump worldview. I agree, of course, although I don't think Michael was defending the patriarchal worldview of GS and may have actually been assuming that its contents would now be understood in non-patriarchal terms. I don't think that assumption is correct, based on our experience of the last few decades, but to be fair, that wasn't the substance of his essay, either. At the same time, I agree that the Church is even more responsible for sexism than Mr. Trump's inane comments are, and that we can't assume we have what it takes to correct others until we correct ourselves. -M

For we require a woman as deaconess for many needs.  First of all, in the baptism of women, the deacon shall anoint only their foreheads with holy oil and after him the deaconess shall anoint them, for there is no need for women to be observed by men."""" -------Apostolic Constitutions III.16; trans E.

""""Repeal and replace"""" has always meant simply and only """"repeal"""", as we are learning as we watch Trump flailing and floundering, attempting to save the parts of the ACA that people like and want, while having no coherent plan for doing that.  By all means, the ACA needs to be improved; but clearly Trump has no plan to do that.

One thing that irks me when immigration comes up is the suggestion mainly by left wingers that Conservatives are always opposed to large scale immigration.  In truth, Conservative PMs are much more responsible than Liberal PMs for a Canada open to immigration starting with MacDonald who, on a % of population basis, allowed more immigration than any PM.  Diefenbaker's bill of rights and even more his rewrite of the Immigration Act enabled those who were not white Europeans to immigrate here.  Mulroney's 250% increase in Trudeau's immigration quotas set the template for contemporary immigration policy.  Harper with a quota of 280,000 set the record for number of immigrants in one year.  Conservatives know high numbers of highly skilled immigrants is essential for Canada's prosperity.

In other words, you don't know what the bleep you're talking about.

I was basically told, """"Whatever."""" So, I carried through on my threat and have not purchased anything from Sears since then.

The cost of the natural gas to generate electricity is a low cost factor for the overall cost of electricity to your home. Property taxes in Anchorage are going up by 4.5% and the tax assessment of your home is also going up. So you will pay lots more in property taxes for the same services. Why? Look at the collective bargaining agreements. Also look at the payroll where you will see the median cost of an employee is more than $136,000: http://alaskapolicyforum.org/2016/03/anchorage-payroll-just-released-453-employees-cost-more-than-the-mayor/

Many Americans weren't prepared for Donald Trump, and now are in a state of shock and disbelief--not knowing how to confront this disaster. Our system of government was set up to promote debate and power sharing--that's why we have 3 branches of government and Congress has two chambers.  These were to provide checks and balances that would prevent any one person or group from dominating.  This system has never faced such a crisis--but it's been slowly developing for decades.  We had gone on automatic cruise control and suddenly our car has broken down.  Let me not analyze what happened and why right now--but let's remember that each one of us has a bit of power and together we can find the way, that God has solutions if we're willing to face this as a spiritual challenge and are willing to grow.

Illegal vacation rentals in residential zoning is not the only cause, but it has contributed to the problem. As you implied, most of the owners of illegal vacation rentals are 2nd-home investors. If these investors are prohibited from operating illegal hotel businesses in residential zoning, not all of them can afford to leave their properties empty for 50 weeks. Many experts have stated the majority of the illegal vacation rentals that are shut-down are either sold to permanent residents or rented long-term. Residential housing advocates such as the Institute of Human Services, the Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, Faith Action for Community Equity, Keep it Kailua and Save Oahu's Neighborhoods have all publicly stated illegal vacation rentals are negatively impacting Oahu's housing supply and the affordability of housing. For anyone to claim illegal rentals have NO impact is absurd.

So when protesters say that they are shell shocked, well of course they are!  They have simply never had a president who actually stood UP against global elitists, or who spoke of Freedom and Liberty, or sovereignty as though it had true meaning.  The  last President I can recall by memory who held very similar values to that of Mr. Trump  was Mr. Reagan,  who's presidential term ended probably right before most of our current protesters were even born.

Let's see, he lead his team in pts with 22, which put him 4th in the playoff scoring race, 10 goals, 12 assists.  His 10 goals was tied for 3rd-best.  Goals created, 3rd with 8.7, tied for the lead with 5 PP goals.  In the finals, Kessel was tied for 2nd on his team in scoring with 4 pts, 1 goal, 3 assists, +1, 2 PP assists, which tied for his team's lead.  Now, 2 PP assists, that's what Matthews got last night, which some otherwise biased observers raved over.  So, all of this, and 1 poster categorizes Kessel as a support player?  That's some support player!  And so, when this poster says Matthews is better than Laine, we can all safely infer that this poster doesn't know his you-know-what from that other thing, and would be well advised to stop talking out of his you-know-what.

This is not just a race issue although it's plain that racism from all sides is stiring a lot of emotions.   On this site, with very few black writers (do we have any regulars?), the mistrust of authority, or, the perceieved incompetance of authority, seems to justify picking up a weapon and killing without police or trial.  Americans need to address the age old questions of crime and punishment.   Race baiting is going to make that very difficult, from all skin colors, (this is not just the responsibility of one race.)  There is no excuse for the murder of the policemen in Dallas, none.    We can try to understand the crime, we can not allow ourselves to forgive it.

0,"The case is complex and complicated.  Unless you are a doctor who is an expert in these genetic diseases, I'm not sure how you can second-guess medical experts.  From what I have been reading, this therapy for children who have the type of disease that Charlie has has not even been tried out on mice.  As Colkoch says, there is such a thing as medical abuse.  I remember, many years ago, a dear family friend telling me how the doctors convinced her to agree to an operation on her husband's brain tumor.  She said that his life was prolonged for a very short time, and that his suffering was incredible.  She was always sorry that she had agreed to the operation.   I know that some people are sometimes cured, but often, many suffer needlessly from these glimmers of hope. I wish that this had not become an international cause.

0,"However, all we read and see on TV in RSA is Trump-Russia (no diversity - we need Fox alongside CNN - it will shock most people how good journalism at Fox actually is versus the caricatures fed to them by partisans that don't even watch Fox)  Yet, despite 9 months of investigations and 24h media reporting on Trump links; we have very little concrete evidence of collusion, a crime or something that would amount to treason.  Does all of this not warrant even a moment of reflection? I still think the Dilbert creator is spot on when he said if nobody else can see the pink elephant in the room (Hitler, dictator, massive failure) maybe you are the one that is hallucinating?  A large part of the Trump media coverage is just political projection BUT is is frustrating and sometimes unbelievable just how much the Trump team of political rookies / non-establishment operatives feeds the Washington machine.

0,"Your opinion is not supported by the facts. There was a standing army when the Constitution was adopted.  Small, perhaps, less than 1M in number, but it did exist and there was written into the Constitution the grant of power from the States to the general government for same. The Framers had every intention af allowing the people to own their own arms and keep them in their homes for they recognized that these were the last guardians of the liberty won in the Independence War. To pretend otherwise for political expediency is, to put it kindly, disingenuous. One has only to recall the military rule of Cornwalis that some were subjected to prior to the war to clearly see and understand this point. The militia is now and always has been comprised of all in the society capable of bearing arms. When we submit the required forms for Selective Service we are, in effect, joining the militia. You may never have thought of it in those terms, but that is what is done.

A new facility was completed in Salem last year, and a site in Junction City is expected to open in the next two years.  While any increase in public psychiatric bed populations makes it possible to meet the treatment needs of more individuals, a bump of nine beds is unlikely to change the fact that people with severe mental illness in Oregon are three times more likely to be behind bars than hospitalized. Fifty beds per 100,000 people are considered minimal.  With 18.3 beds per 100,000 residents, Oregon by 2010 was providing only 18% of that minimum (Treatment Advocacy Center)

Another senior judge was reported to have found this puzzling? At the time in Alberta some  had problems with justice in Alberta? A driver could hit  a pedestrian, make false statements for a year and not get charged in some cases? After a year of escaping, a year was up, the driver could acknowledge the accident and not get charged by the police? Of course from the  moment the accident happened the driver did not have any plate on the front of the car? Wow whnat a gift? Thereby making it harder to identify a car that was removed, left the scene? Now imagine owning some property,a criminal drives foreward into your yard,  no  licence plate? Then drives backwards, away after theft? Victims, Alberta, not  safe, secure place, for some! I wonder who benefits from Alberta justice like this? Money?

While the ball is on Trump's side fo the court so to speak, its the American's who need to decide how far they want to go.  If they really do want to go all the way and toss NAFTA and the FTA, there is still a simple fall back position that works for both parties.  Remember, that Canada and the USA had a long standing agreement to reduce tarrifs and duties to ZERO by 1995.  That would be 1 year after the FTA came into effect... ( LOL yes I know... the purpose of the FTA was pure optics, of the political variety ).  That original agreement might be a bit more realisitc for both parties as a fall back position.

Trump has never called these violent acts on American soil by white supremacists """"domestic"""" terrorism despite the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warnings and Trump continues to place the blame for """"violence"""" in America on those of other races.

In fact our total provincial + federal debt to GDP ratio now is not far off what it was in the 90s just now it is the provinces rather than feds who hold more of the debt.

0,"It is not necessary to even wait three days.  I'm not sure which three vaccines you mean; measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccines are all live virus vaccines.  Rotavirus vaccine is live as well, but not given to school children, just babies.  The live flu vaccine was not used last year; I don't know yet what the recommendation will be this year.  The viruses in all these vaccines is quite weakened. There has never been a documented case of a recently vaccinated individual transmitting measles, mumps or rubella.  Chickenpox can rarely be transmitted, about 1 time in every 11 million doses, which is more doses than are given in the US in a year.  However, the recipient has to develop a rash, and the rash has to turn pustular, and then the other person has to have contact with the pus.  Rotavirus vaccine is shed in the stool, and if you wash your hands after changing a recently vaccinated baby's diaper, you will be safe.

BO warned 45 about 'flying blind' without intelligence and that the presidency cannot be run by improvisation.  The mess that ensued with this Muslim ban (departments that should have been involved in the decision were not) clearly shows he's ignoring this advice.  His supporters keep asserting they hired him because he's a business man and they need a businessman to run the country.

In a corporation you give orders and your employees jump, that's what 45 is used to, that's what he's doing...good luck with that.

On the article: 1. The shooter in Las Vegas did not use an automatic rifle, stop repeating stuff that is false. 2. Comparing a gangster shooting vs a lone nut-case. They have nothing in common except that in both cases firearms were used. Prohibiting them does not in any way does solve the problem. The shooting in ZA is drug related with illegal guns being used, how would a strict gun law impact gangsters that use illegal weapons any way and frankly if they had no guns would use something else. 3. Claims that the FCA is not policed which is absolutely false. The FCA is viciously implemented and policed because it only affect the legal gun owners. Don't believe, apply for a firearm license and you will see. The lack of policing when combatting crime is not the same as the burocratic monster that is the FCA.

Fine words but the circumstances are far different from Mohamed's time.  Canadians in general are not rejecting Islam, although few will embrace the faith. Instead we give Muslims a safe haven, which the people of Taif did not give to Mohamed.  The reaction against Muslims is founded on acts of extremists within its own ranks. Every culture has a few nut bars who are looking for pretexts to act out their rage. Muslim extremists are providing this pretext to our nut bars regardless where they take place. Islamic extremists demonstrate an ugly aspect of Islam which does not respect other religions nor sects within their own.  Moderate Muslims are not speaking out enough against these people, not rejecting their message strongly enough. It is time they did. The author should lead on this front.

0,"Our objective (both as a national goal & in the global arena) should be to show that an advanced national economy can make a balanced (economically sustainable, greenhouse gas emission reducing) transition to a sustainable economy.  A revenue-neutral carbon tax with a legislated scheduled tax rate increases into the indefinite future is the way to proceed.  The regressive impact of the tax can be offset by progressive rebates targeting low & modest income earners.  The fact that tax rates will be high in the long term doesn't have to retard economic activity because it is a steady progression of modest increases that prompts consumers to change their purchase & consumption patterns & prompts manufacturers & retailers to develop & sell greener products.  We evolve to avoid higher rates and become leaders in efficient & effective emission neutral products in international markets.  It will not be easy, but we'll be ahead of the pack rather than dragged unprofitably from the rear.

Their whole """"punch a nazi"""" (aka. anyone right of the far left) movement, is disgusting, and it is coming here.

And, it gives China an opportunity to play 'nice cop' to Trump's 'crazy cop' -- and an opportunity to appear 'statesman-like' on the world stage, which might be attractive to China. The rhetoric might continue to heat up, but what will be telling is what NK actually does in terms of tests and missiles.  When it comes to NK, nothing else has worked so far and there are no good military or regime-change options. Trump seems to have a wonderful grasp of creating and sustaining drama -- maybe that's exactly what's needed here. He needs a win and this would be a big one -- keeping the lid on NK.

As the article suggests, we need a data driven system, but one that focuses on getting and keeping people healthy, not on maximizing medical billings. Putting every 40-yr-old in front of a naturopath to prevent crhonic illness and every one of the 27% of the population who will need a psychologist at some point, in front of a psychologist, not an alienated psychiatrist, has the potential to cut up to $200,000 for a person's lifetime medical billings and preserve about $100,000 in future income taxes they will  not pay should they get sucked into the medical profiteering void of chronic illness, endless tests and procedures and an early preventable death.

This massacre was, I feel, more from a mentally unstable, confused man who chose this ISIS cause as his reason when it's more likely he was at the end of his rope for other reasons (conflicted about his sexuality, failed marriages, powerless, had history of mental instability).

When 13% of the population of the US commit 30% of the crime, then blacks will be targeted disproportionately.  When black crime rate decreases to 13% nationally, then blacks will be targeted proportionately.  Because of their many days of training, when a police officer suspects a person, he or she has an obligation to investigate.  If the person cooperates and the officer shows no probable cause, then everything is cool and both parties leave.  If the person doesn't cooperate, then the officer has to put into place their training to subdue and arrest the individual.  99% of police officers in our country are faithful, honest people.  Sen. Tim Scott is referencing the 1% or less who feel that the black 13% of our population are to be considered suspicious 100% of the time.

0,"It is important to note that when judging the truth value of a particular viewpoint, the truth value does not depend upon whether or not that particular viewpoint is a minority or a majority viewpoint. What matters is whether or not the elements that exist within that particular viewpoint are grounded in truth or in error.  For example, Dred Scott v. Sanford, which denied the essence of personhood, clearly contained an error in both substantive and procedural due process law. Thus, in the light of the self-evident truth regarding personhood, and the legal precedent that was set, through the addition of The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, which serve to clarify The Fifth Amendment in the spirit of Truth, it is not unconstitutional to recognize that a Judge is still following precedent in cases where it can be demonstrated that there has been an error in substantive and/or procedural due process law.
"
0,"No, it's not a """"bald-faced lie.""""  Long term incarceration has been proven time and time again not to work.  It reforms no-one and makes none of us safer. Any incarceration almost immediately increases criminal thinking and works to undo rehabilitative efforts, such as they are in Alaska. You can guess the results. If crime rates have increased so little, how do you explain the need to build more prisons? Hire more Correctional staff? Why are people complaining about the uptick in crime. SB91 was just passed last July. Most provisions aren't even in effect yet.  Where are you getting your statistics, if any? Are you including reoffenders?  Unsentenced people? And finally, unless you lock everyone up for life, they are going to get out sometime. The USA  already has the largest prison population in the world, serving the longest sentences, locked up at the fastest rate. Please provide me with solid, verifiable evidence that this approach works to decrease crime & increase safety.

Democrats pander to those who believe they've been deprived of what they're entitled to, and Republicans pander to those who believe what is rightfully theirs has been taken from them. Nobody played the """"victim"""" card as relentlessly or to greater effect than did Donald Trump in the 2016 election.  Characterizing the mess that is the U.S. political culture as being the fault of one side only is absurd.

But (a) atmospheric CO2 is a significant indicator (forcing agent) of earth's temp (there's less than a one in a million chance this is NOT the case), and (b) the earth's CO2 levels have just spiked well beyond anything it has seen in the past 800,000 years, primarily due to human activities.  Now if these two facts don't have you concerned then I have a dune where you can go bury your head.  Fortunately these teens realize this and are doing their best to take action. Unfortunately people like you who refuse to recognize this problem (even when most people on this planet DO) are slowing progress toward doing something about it.

0,"Unless Trump or Putin are insane (hopefully that is not true), this conflict can be expected to escalate and US snf Russian military soldiers will possibly clash and die.  It might start with a few soldiers getting killed then the next targets are ships or planes on both sides with lives & hundreds millions in military hardware destroyed but the leap from killing hundreds of soldiers & military targets to targeting civilian populations with nuclear weapons is a far stretch and neither Russia or the US will neither win that battle.  However the calculations have been made and the sacrifice of military personnel and personnel on both the US and Russian sides are now at an acceptable outcome by Trump, Putin and those in charge of their military.   Definitely agree that Trump is unpredictable and an advantage to the US.  Hopefully with all of the wars, including the bogus wars in Iraq for a 2nd time US military technology is currently superior to Russia, cause that is what will win wars

And let's not forget the numerous Jewish people we did not accept in our """"diverse"""" and welcome nations before patting ourselves on the back for letting in the few we felt were useful.

Additionally, why would Kitz not be fired later for requesting her to do that? He was obstructing a federal investigation and attempting to destroy public records.  Also, Jaquiss's low point, in my opinion, was the way he treated Mark Callahan and JoAnne Perkins (not present in that interview session). It was immature and disrespectful of Jaquiss to write """"blah, blah, blah"""" down when JoAnne articulated a decent response. Callahan called him out on it as he should have. The 3 other candidates present should have shown solidarity and all left at that point  As far as outpacing the O on the Dunham-Goldschmidt story, well the O made the same mistake later on a scandal involving one of their editors.

In no way shape or form has it been proven that just because someone who has never been convicted of crime won't commit crime. You must wonder how crime began in the first place. And in no way does being convicted of crime fundamentally change anyone. What's criminal is political, which means it's subject to change, and change it does. Whether someone is inherently good or bad does not rest in the politics of a nation/state.  To answer your question, I do not want idiots to be allowed to make decisions based on whether someone else has been harassed by a corrupt government.

Quote Pope Francis, selectively, restructure the diocese under the guise of a collaborative missionary effort, circle the wagons of rich laity, suck them for lots of money to fix up the cathedral with public gardens (that runs sprinkles so the homeless won't sleep there), and micro-manage the diocese.  We have to understand something, in case we forgot: A bishop answers to NO ONE. That is a lot of power. Of course, we have to give them consent to have authority over us.....hmmm

0,"Hate is winning, and that's about as un-Christian as it gets.  What do these guys think happens to unloved unwanted children? It's being doomed to a life of suffering and high risk for physical and mental illness, addictions and crime. Availability of abortion lessens this risk.  Trump Pence and cronies should focus on the rights of children already in existence, and on stewardship of the world for their future. So far they’re failing on both counts and their ideology bodes ill for what’s next. Soon we’ll see proposals for bigger jail budget plus harsher punitive measures for young offenders. … Force them to be born into terrible circumstances, deprive them of support, then jail them.  Is this really how Americans think?

But the last decade clearly demonstrated that it is NOT a """"Liberal"""" phenomena, as your post tries to suggest.

These are stateless actors using propaganda on the digital front to spread their extremists dogma.  The best way to counter this is to be persistent and diligent in shutting them down on the digital front.  The second step is to monitor Imams in local mosques to ensure that they are not spreading extremists ideologies.  Even the middle east muslim countries monitor the messages spread by Imams in their country.  It is folly for the west to allow extremists ideologies to be spread under the guise of freedom of religion.  There are limits to freedom of religion under our Charter.

Just look at how well Canada's border controls work, people cross illegally and get free stuff, once people see how well it works illegally, they will try to enter legally, because it's 2017. Sunny ways and naive idealism is obviously more important than common sense. Canada's immigration system is a joke ripe for abuse and Trudeau aims to keep it that way, how do you think he makes so many magazine covers? Everyone knows maintaining a system that encourages migrants to break the law in an effort to jump the cue is better than the alternative, just look at Australia, illegal immigration has virtually stopped, which is why Canada does the opposite.

Often after a stock undergoes a long run higher, a stock split, particularly if it is 3:1, 4:1 or more, will occur very close to the ultimate end of the run for the stock (see tech stocks in late 1999 / 2000 as just one example.) The stock split is just one factor, and a relatively minor one at that, to consider when evaluating a stock.

0,"the Political Correct state school board placed a ban on all Indian mascots. This arrogance that knows no shame included banning the Indian mascots of sovereign Native American tribes. Every last justification given for this ban has been thoroughly debunked for the shameless pathological lies they are. This is teaching our children a racist stereotyping of our culture, forcing us Native Americans to fight for our culture, and why we overturned this ban, twice. As a recent Washington Post poll confirmed what every other legitimate poll taken has shown, 90% of us Red Skins overwhelmingly support Indian mascots. It's okay to say white conservatives are out of touch with the black and brown community, but if I say I am a red skin Chickasaw, they call me a racist, and therein another example of how liberals shamelessly stereotype Native Americans.

In an interview Marie acknowledged that in her three years on the commission, she had no conversation with Francis other than group social greetings, at the initial stage.

Marie dedicates so much of her time fighting up hill battles in order that children would not have to endure what she was subjected to as a child at the hands of a hospital chaplain in Dublin. Marie is a very reserved and private person, who hates being away from her family. It was a struggle for her to have to have to spend so much time at the Vatican because of her involvement with the commission and its related activities, but she gave willingly because of her overriding objective. I feel angered on her behalf.  It is all summed up in the pompous out-of-touch statement by Fr Hans Zolliner ..

If the parties were reversed I would say exactly the same thing.  Apparently the Republican senate has forgoten how to lead and functions only as a reaction to the President.

Roughly 1/3 of the voters would vote for Stalin if he had a D after his name, another 1/3 would vote Mussolini if he had an R after his name.

Once again, the Federal Gov't's responsibilities lie in providing for the general welfare AND the common defense.  The general welfare is based on all following the law, receive fair hearings (trials), unimpeded goods and services crossing state lines. It is not defined as a particular welfare or recipient of that. Also, securing our rights guaranteed in the Constitution, with most other responsibilities devolving to the States or the People.

Now, this is where the problems enter.  The original designer is no longer on board, and the State has no idea about the actual construction.  In the litigation, I believe the General Contractor will prevail.  They have the approved paper trail on all the construction challenges and change orders, in detail.  Now enter the user, HawaiianAir.  I am willing to wager that HawaiianAir has its fingers in the dispute between the General Contractor and the State.  If HawaiianAir begin to use the facility without final inspections and signed off, they and the State bought the project.

Higher values benefit the majority of society because 75% of the population own their primary residence.  Higher values lead to more local spending on local goods and services.  More consumption and home equity can be used for more domestic investment in local businesses.  Some foreign investors generate income tax on Canadian income as well.  And investment in the local property market fuels employment in construction, marketing and advertising, legal, engineering, finance, brokerage, furniture, insurance, etc.  And foreign investors send their children to local private schools that pay teachers salaries and of course other operating expenses.  Foreign investors fuel demand for hotel rooms, car rentals and purchases, etc.  Remove foreign investment from Vancouver and you'll probably find yourself out of a job.

If we were a genuine compassionate democracy this would be a no-brainer. The trend towards greedy maximization of profits these last 30 years is clearly the worst thing holding back progress, democracy, inclusiveness, and equality. It's why the middle class is disappearing and the huge gap between rich and the rest has become a chasm. Genuine social democracies like Norway, Sweden and Denmark are the role models for the world largely because they have minimized income disparities with mature compassionate economic policies emphasizing quality of life for all.

Are the corrupt unions or Dems responsible for corrupting that system too? On your list of hypothetical employees, yes, the descendants of a soldier or cop that is killed in the line of duty or a good samaritan deserves to be considered for  some kind of financial assistance from their parents employer after that parent dies. Given our current system of corporate greed, the union members descendants are the only ones with a snowballs chance in Hades of actually receiving any.

0,"I think one can favour less government without going to the extreme Bernier has.  Wanting to reduce it to its size it was in 2000 in real terms is quite reasonable as Canada was doing just fine then.  Fiscal policy is not just about cutting taxes, but I think modest tax cuts are fine.  The top marginal rate exceeds 50% in 7 of 10 provinces which is too high.  Asking the rich to pay tax rates of 45% combined provincial + federal is more than sufficient.  As for unions they have a purpose but unfortunately our unions unlike in say Germany or Nordic Countries tend to be adversarial and dogmatic rather than cooperative and reasonable thus the hostility.  Ours seem to be like the British unions which are the worse rather than the German ones which have worked reasonably well there.

But I wanted to make the point that it is not just children who don't get these services. It is an entire vulnerable population of seriously mentally ill (SMI) Canadians and Americans and most nations who don't receive appropriate, or any, care for their chronic brain diseases.    Of course this is my regular beef about Canada's sluggish response to any aspect of SMI, but especially the need for scientific brain research which is becoming better understood as the path to a waiting cure. I hope more people understand the need to advocate for scientific research to end these human brain diseases. Current governments are not capable enough to fix this system.

0,"I think that it is important to distinguish between benefits that allow you more income to utilize and those that don't.  The example here is the guy that gets a discounted meal versus the grocery clerk that gets free groceries.  In the case of the discounted meal, there is a benefit to me but it is likely less than the amount of my discount.  I could (and did when I worked in restaurants) forgo eating at the restaurant if I wanted to eat at home and not have to pay anything.  The discount doesn't add to my bottom line.  But the free groceries do add to my bottom line.  I get for free something which I need and already pay for.  That frees up cash that I can do something else with.  For clothing stores, clerks are often required to wear their employers clothes at work.  Does that help them? Maybe.  If you like the clothes.  When I worked retail, I was still out money even when you used the discount.  I had to spend more there than if I was able to buy used or through Wal-Mart.

One point that stands out starkly is the """"alleged"""" motive for the killing of David Grunwald. In another ADN article, Almandinger reportedly said: """"He smoked all of my pot"""" and separately """"We didn't get any money from Grunwald [for the pot]."""" The present ADN article reports: """"Almandinger said ... he, Grunwald and Johnson drank and smoked marijuana in the camper.""""  It is unclear whether Grunwald truly smoked any pot at all in the camper that night, and if so, if under duress or not, and also if so, whether he smoked all of Almandinger's pot. We don't know all of the facts yet and may never know all of the facts, and more facts will come out before and during any court trial of this case. It is questionable that someone would kill Grunwald for the alleged offense of smoking Almandinger's pot. The real motive seems unknown.

I have never screamed 'NAZI'S' on this thread or even used the term.  It would appear you are the one frothing at the mouth. As to why hundreds of thousand of people take hunter safety courses, it might have something to do with hunter safety courses being mandated in all 50 states to purchase a hunting license.

Yours is a circular argument that has to believe YOU personally know the mind of God, which you do not.    You quote human/church scripture out of context and remove the many other ways in which God reveals his love for his/her imperfect children outside of the walls of a church.  Your faith is your own and if it makes you a more loving and compassionate person, they I would say you are fed by the Fruits of the Spirit.  I can't know your heart, I'll leave that judgement to another source.  If you use your religion to lift your status above God's other children, then yours is not a faith that I can share.  Peace

Dentists can apply SDF to give them time before they actually normally restore the tooth or they can leave the cavitated lesion there and cover it with SDF. In that case, it is recommended to monitor the lesion and, possibly, reapply at standard hygiene recalls. It is also a very good solution for population with limited access to dental treatments.

0,"Universities were never meant to be job training institutes.  They have moved this way in many areas over time and certain programs such as English are simply hold-overs from the older days.  (Colleges and polytechnics such as NAIT, SAIT, BCIT, etc. are designed for vocational education.)  Having said that I agree that it is ridiculous that so many young people are marched off to university when so many are neither prepared for that type of learning or the least bit interested in real higher education.  Too many young people are there just for adult babysitting and partying, especially in the arts faculties (where you can get away with it without being kicked out).  The honest professors who truly are passionate for their specialties will be the first to agree with me.

Criticism is legitimate, however holding Israel in contempt and opprobrium and out of proportion to any other party in the Middle East, and claiming that Israel has no right to exist, is well beyond mere criticism.

It'll help with my self-identity. Maybe all blue collar workers are working class and all white collar workers are middle or upper class. Or is it more complicated than that? And if someone who is working class morphs into the middle class, do they suddenly become the oppressor rather than the oppressed? If so, exactly when does that happen? Of course, someone going from the middle class to the working class is probably just getting their well deserved comeuppance.

Over time they seem to migrate from one ER to another if they aren't getting what they want from ER #1, they head to ER #2. If the medical community doesn't find a way to get this 6% back into the primary care setting they will continue to be high users of the system. Unfortunately, it has been my experience that those frequent fliers are typically folks living on the edge (homeless, disabled and with poor social supports). The trick is to give this marginalized group a medical home where they feel supported and listened to. I think that's the point, isn't it? Making all Alaskans the healthiest people in the world.

We were also holding them there with no standards for releasing them. And oftentimes, living conditions were miserable. But, they were out of sight, right? Plus, we """"emptied the mental hospitals"""" under Ronald Reagan, with the promise of funding community mental health centers. A promise we haven't kept. PS: """"It isn't about spending to fix it.

Our local homeless population is intertwined intimately with our local drug and crime problems, which are growing rapidly even though national crime rates are down.

The fact that this crime involved both drugs and a homeless person is certainly useful information where the juxtaposition of crime, drugs and homelessness is topical.

0,"EB-5 projects have an additional requirement that they create a certain number of permanent jobs: 10 jobs per EB-5 investor.  That's the whole point of having an analysis of a Targeted Employment Area.  One wonders how a condo building would create more than one or two permanent jobs.  If, for example, a project were to raise $10 million from EB-5 investors, that would require 20 investors at $500,000 each, which would in turn require the project to generate 200 permanent jobs.  The commitment to cheap, non-union construction labor is not good either - it's that much less money generated for our communities.  But to me, the perplexing thing is the double standard on immigration.  Immigrants can get in if they invest $500,000 (which they'll get back) - so that basically means immigrants are welcome if they are rich.  OK - but why should immigration be so hard for everyone who isn't rich?

0,"Yes, in Canada they have ‘Girl Guides of Canada’, but for some there can be issues.  First off, Girl Guides only allows female leaders (Scouts has always allowed make and female leaders).  Second, while male parents are allowed to attend camps and activities during the day, males are not allowed at camps overnight.  Many parents want to be involved with these activities and fathers cannot fully participate.  Also, many including myself, like to show children that both men and women can lead, and that they can work together.  This is demonstrated in Scouts.  What does gender segregation teach our children?  Don’t get me wrong, the Girl Guides are a great organization, but parents want and deserve a choice between segregation and inclusion.

But that would take a politician skilled in the art of diplomacy and compromise, talents sadly lacking in the boorish one.  The man he dethroned probably could have done it.  Reagan may have been able to achieve it.  But Trump is obsessed with the Art of the Deal and a no compromise bullying style.  It will not wash.  The man is incapable of learning from his mistakes, and still believes the bragadaccio and swagger of his private sector days will triumph.  What's more, the naysayers are fully aware of his dwindling political capital -- lowest initial approval ratings in history, with nowhere to go but down -- and will use it against him.

There is a question of degree and most certainly Power at play that changes the concept of assault between gender roles.   Good thing to think about.     Many men expect a woman to take a beating before calling rape/assault.   Yet if a woman does as you suggest, coerces a man to do something he doesn't want to do, no physical assault is necessary.   Double standard for some who think that way - not suggesting that you do Bill.  It comes down to abuse of power.    In most cases men win a physical battle.  But that's not true of Roger Alles, in his case it was all about power in his work environment.   A woman with the same power may well have the same failing.  We live in interesting times.

0,"Kieran, as long as Francis remains silent about the Pontifical Secret under Canon Law; his credibility remains low on this key issue. This was exposed in an Irish Judicial Reviews, which highlighted an 1997 letter from the Papal Nuncio at the time; instructing the Irish Hierarchy that their agreed policy of mandatory reporting  to civil authorities, of priests accused of child abuse, was in conflict with Canon Law. They changed the policy inline with Vatican instructions. Subsequently, in Benedict's letter of apology to Irish Catholics dated the 19th March 2010.; he blamed the mismanagement of Irish bishops. They did not hide their anger from the media, for being made the """"fall-guys"""" after they following instructions from Rome. I find most of the Pope' comments, as reported above,  to be sadly lacking in integrity. While he appears genuine to address the issue;  he back-peddled into a quagmire. Do you think, that it is to get a preemptive move ahead of the Royal Commission's Report ?

0,"This conundrum facing illegal immigrants has been brought on by a lack of timely enforcement and a workable pathway to citizenship.  Holding employers and/or service providers accountable for the residence status of their employees/consumers will help in timely enforcement.  Albeit debatable, if America wants to be """"the country of opportunity to the world,"""" then we need adequate resources and commitment to fulfill the expectation that this creates.  However, while I am sympathetic to the problem Ortiz and Hanusz face, sorry to say but after 10+ years maintaining an illegal status because there wasn't a """"route to citizenship"""" is not logical.   There is no route to make an illegal act, legal.  While it may sound like a """"catch 22,"""" we are a country of laws.   It is almost like having a thief of 10 years say, """"I wanted to become legal but there was no route to make robbery legal.""""

0,"Regrettably your comments seem spot on for this Pontifical Commission. One way of ensuring its failure is to starve it of resources, as three members have already testified to the Australian Royal Commission. And another way of ensuring that canon law is not touched is by appointing a canon lawyer who does not speak the common language of all the others (English), and then when he resigns, not appointing another competent English speaking one in his place. Fortunately not all Commissions are like that and the Australian Royal Commission is a very good example. It is obvious from some of the comments made by the Commissioners that substantial changes to canon law and practice are going to be recommended. One would have thought that the clever thing to have done was to make the changes before we see another example of secular society dragging the Church into the realities of the modern world. If the Church cannot design a decent disciplinary system, civil law will impose it.

How hard is it for Caldwell, Roy Amemiya or someone on his staff to contact the FTA with regard to the necessity to have the reported """"stress test"""" money of approximately $600 million.  News reporter Gina Mangieri was able to find out this was NOT needed by calling the FTA.  Colleen  Hanabusa made that call and found out from the FTA that the extra stress test funds are NOT applicable.  When told this confirmed fact, Caldwell still hemmed and hawed on TV, would not make eye contact with Rep. Lopresti and refused to answer.

People bathed and washed their clothing in the rivers, which also received untreated sewage.  Infections of parasites were commonly acquired through the feet, and invariably skin infections developed from wearing in freshly-washed clothing.  We brought solar-powered lighting to rural villages which were not serviced by the electrical grid, and built a road connecting several remote villages in a food-for-work program.  These programs were aimed at increasing food production, teaching technologies that were not dependent on imported fertilizers.

In fact, I'd go so far as to argue that a high profile trial of climate change deniers would help to preserve democracy in the face of  extreme climate disruption.

His attack on AfriForum and then closing the comments section so that those he attack cannot respond. These same liberals claim to fight for freedom of media and speech and claim to """"open the debate"""" about racism, yet censor all comments.  As for Sparrow. The latest interpretation by the courts regarding hate speech is that it should also incite harm. She was stupid yes but her comments never incited violence or harm against any group. And nobody mentions that nothing came of Khumalo who DID incite violence by stating that people should do to whites what Hitler did to the Jews.  At least here on DM they had opened the comments section again so that the public can exercise their right to comment, react or defend themselves.  Most liberal journalists are Sycophants.

If you look at PR's Yelp reviews the majority of the complaints are about the long wait time for their orders to come out. Last time I was there for lunch two tables near me walked out because they waiting so long for their food. As things got worse, you hardly ever saw Alan there to try to fix things. I think he was resolved to the fact that he was going to close. I was a regular customer there and continued to go there even after things started getting bad mainly because I thought the """"front of the restaurant staff"""" (wait staff) was so good. You can't blame the """"wait staff"""" for long wait times if the kitchen is backed up. When the kitchen would get backed up with orders and you've waited over 30-45 minutes for your order to come out, a free edamame just wont keep customers coming back...

0,"This description of the army in  making terrible situations even worse sounds like a replica of the way our society makes serious mental ill citizens more difficult to manage  and more stressful for their families.   Families of SMI also find it impossible to learn from hospitals or other service professionals about their loved ones conditions and treatments up to their deaths or suicides.  Maybe this is a fear of being blamed for something that caused this death  Or maybe it seems too awful to repeat to loving families. This means training the military about how to tell details to families, if they ask for this information.  Most young people, or others are not prepared for this difficult task, so practice might help everyone who has to perform this saddest  of tasks . Let us make it easier for those with this responsibility.

When former Ukraine went to hell due to a USA-sponsored coup, Putin granted Crimea the stability and security that they wanted. When the USA invaded Syria and funded terrorist groups in hopes that they would destroy the government there and send Syria into a long-lasting nightmare, Putin stopped that from happening. When the USA became unhinged in thinking that Assad had used chemical weapons, Putin was the voice of reason and struck a deal between the Syrian government and the USA to have all of Syria's chemical weapons facilities decommissioned. And when the USA tried to spin another chemical false flag operation, Putin resolutely pointed out that there is no evidence to support that claim, and that the USA nor UN ever investigated the site. And while the USA spun 'Russia-hacking' propaganda, Putin has been patient as the USA gets its crazy out.

Research the origin of Christianity. here is one thought: a baby born from a maiden (not a virgin as Christianity would like us to believe, but a maiden as the correct translation would attest), became known as the Messiah, performed miracles, healed the sick, raised the dead, ascended to heaven. Just a short summery, but the person referred to was not Christ but the Lord Mithra who predated Christ by 1 000 years. Buchan bases his story on American evangelism who are through the ages directly responsible for some of the worst atrocities bestown upon mankind. These are the people who treat all who do not believe in their version of God as heathens that should be wiped off the face of this earth.

I hear from my Native friends that they're hassled a lot. My son and a friend were forced to submit to a stop and frisk this summer because they were walking downtown. It was completely random abuse of teenagers. I've had city cops practically demand to search my vehicle after they stopped me for a burned out license plate light. The local cops have shot several citizens this year. So it is not unbelievable that the officer was acting in an abusive or even threatening manner and this man felt he needed to protect himself or end up dead. Editing suggests there's something to hide.  I'm not saying it's right to shoot cops. I'm saying that the cops are setting up an adversarial situation where people now fear for their lives when interacting with them and that setup guarantees things like this will happen.

0,"The federal debt is simply the total amount of money that the federal government has spent into the economy.  As the monopoly issuer of the US dollar, the federal government can hypothetically create and spend as much new money into the economy as it wants to.  As a monetarily sovereign nation, the US can never go broke unlike a private household, business, state or local government  or even a nation like Greece which gave up its monetary sovereignty when it joined the EU.  Furthermore, the federal government doesn't need to tax its citizens or borrow money from a nation like China to fund spending.  The debt ceiling is an arbitrary number imposed by Congress that acts as an unnecessary constraint to federal spending.  The only natural constraint to federal spending is inflation which is a result of a shortage in supply of a finite resource such as oil, food, cars or people (workers).   Our federal taxes keep inflation under control by removing excess dollars from the economy.

They also realize that standing up to the US in these circumstances might lead to a breakdown in negotiations and an unwanted trade war but hopefully, most of us realize that we must face that possibility in a united way because the consequences would be much worse if we show either craven weakness or hollow bravado.

I'm very glad the practice is in disfavor. And I agree that nothing under the rubric of recovered memory should by itself be sufficient to convict a person in a court of law, without other forms of corroboration.  I grieve for the difficulty of successfully prosecuting people for these violent acts.  It seems like a cultural problem that the courts will not be able to diminish much.  I'll add that my father in law was sexually abused by cousins when he was a child, that he was a minister and a high-school teacher, and served in WWII, in the Pacific theater.

So many religious created a monumental legacy of service only to see much of it crumble in front of their aged and incredulous eyes, and were tremendously deserving of aid.

But hey, you're a conservative, so you can be expected to support a man who clearly despises the Constitution (he wants to abolish Freedom of Speech because the mean old newspapers are being mean to him.)  Your sneer at Pope Francis shows that you prefer war to peace, which is also part and parcel of American conservatism -- pseudo-patriotism is preferable both to real patriotism and to Christianity.

0,"Kudos to the government for taking on the issue which is contentious politically. Corporate tax rates were significantly reduced by previous conservatives, resulting in many individuals setting up CCPC's for """"businesses"""" for tax benefits only. However, there needs to be a delicate scalpel approach and not the crude axe, as the lion's share of CCPC's are legitimate businesses who use the benefits for (arm's length) hiring, investing in plant & equipment, new tools, expanding revenue sources, etc. High earning professionals who already have high T4 income (ie. MP's, university professors, some IT employees) set up corporations for  """"side"""" businesses (ie speaking engagements, contract work on the side). Where is the business risk in this?  These income streams should be reported as other income/sole proprietorship income on the T1 return. And their retirement investments (registered and non-registered) should be subject to the same rules as employees and reported on the T1 return.

The Yankees were bought for $8.7 million in 1973 and were worth $3.2 billion in 2010 - an increase of some 4000%.  Steinbrenner paid 1.9% of the purchase price and increased his holdings to 57% by the time he died.  This is an increase of better than 200, 000 % over what he originally paid.  Furthermore, the Yankees were the most consistently successful team of the 90s and 00s on the field, making the playoffs most years and winning at least 4 world series including 3 back to back.  Sounds like you are probably a fan of the Obama school of management and results in which the CEO borrows more money than his 43 predecessors combined over 240 years in order to fashion the weakest growth of all nine post WWII recessions.

It found a tiny gap in initial pay, less than a percent, due to poorer negotiation, but both male and female graduates were WELL above the media for lawyers, let alone above the median for the population. After graduation, though, it was a steady slide until after the 15 year window concluded, there was over a 40% gap in pay between those female and male lawyers.  But ...  When they accounted for every other factor, including breaks in employment, part time, hours, education maintenance, etc. that dropped to less than 5%.

0,"Dude, this is some serious misinformation! The sole argument people have for eating meat is that they think it tastes good.  They willingly destroy our planet, destroy their health, and support animal cruelty, that they wouldn't inflict to animals themselves, because apparently taste buds are more important.  People are selfish monsters.  Vegan diets benefit the entire planet.  Why choose to be on the side of violence and destruction when it's completely unnecessary?  Meat based diets are unsustainable for this planet.  Google """"Meat industry environment""""  Vitamin B-12 is a bacteria, and the only reason you get it from meat is because livestock are given B-12 injections.  Plants contain all the essential amino acids. The most trusted board of dieticians in the world states that well planned vegan diets are appropriate for all stages of life. There are many world class athletes and record holders that are vegan.  Vegan diets actually reduce the risks of all the diseases you cited.

0,"The first and last time I went to TR, it was to see Trampled By Turtles, about 5years ago. We got there early (about an hour), as we were told the show was """"sold out"""". I noticed a couple of fire marshall signs that said """"capacity 250"""". So as the show started, I noticed the ticket booth was still selling tickets, as opposed to their earlier notice of being """"sold out"""".  This show was the most crowded music venue I've ever been to. We were packed in there like sardines....literally. By my count, there were at least 400 people crammed in the space. The really weird and frightening thing was, the fire marshall occupancy signs were removed from the walls about half way through the show. So my friends and I looked at each other in amazement. Why would we want to come back here to a place that so blatantly disregarded the safety of their customers in favor of a bigger short term profit. So I also wondered, what kind of food safety short cuts were lurking in the kitchen.

0,"Your details presumably pertain to the advisor's personal cut of the trailer fee being about 50%, while the broker retains the rest of the 100bps (most equity MFs). Under CRM2, only the trailer fee is being disclosed in dollar terms to clients.  Yet the average total MER on Canadian MFs is about 224bps, more than double the trailer portion, and after all, it's the client who is paying the full shot, regardless of how it's divvied up. Many advisors are licenced to only sell MFs, so ETFs cannot be offered by those people, regardless of lower revenue to the broker.  If you read the ads sponsored by CI (and others), they will compare performance of F-class MFs that have a lower MER, because you can only buy this series when you are paying your advisor a fee (1% - 2%) on top of the fund MER for managing your account. Another asterisk to note when talking total fees or fund performance.

No one can say if the Princess is indeed 100% or less of her faculties right now, but when she set up the Trust with Mr. Wright as Trustee, she obviously knew what she was doing and for her to change her mind now is highly suspect.  As Mr. Wright says- he is is not a beneficiary and has nothing to gain, but those like the less than respectable Mike Lilly (look HIM up) and Ms. Worth have everything to lose.

The gospels that actually name the apostles don't even have the same list of names.  The 'church' didn't even exist as an organized religion until after Constantine (around 312).  The church was alive with political maneuvering; hence what we see today.  The Bible, which didn't exist in a New Testament form until the 400's, has been edited, translated and retranslated through the generations to fit the male hierarchal ideology. Now the hierarchy have backed themselves in a corner of historical tradition and can't admit that they just might have misinterpreted the teachings and practices of Jesus.

1,"I don't think the GOP can go on this way without absolutely destroying America. Trump, as the embodiement of More, Bigger and Louder, without Quality, without Responsible forethought, without caring, and exuding the the ugliness of what happens when self interest becomes unchecked, has the ability to accelerate that destruction and neutralize America's natural defenses to that happening at the hands of any individual, group or political party. Trump's fatness is a metaphor for a lot. I think it should be discussed extensively both for the criticism it invites, the consequences it portends, and because, most of all, We ALL want America to be Great.  If you are honest, you must conced that It cannot be under Trump. . . if for no other reason, but just one of many reasons, than he is getting too fat.

It was pulling teeth to get the legislature to agree to even the first steps of prudently cutting and initiating a plan to raise revenue to replace oil income. We wouldn`t be here, with a major SB21 oil tax revision done, and plans to take on the issues of capital and operating budgets and a needed broad-based revenue tax, without the administrations prodding.  It`s time to put ideological partisanship aside and face the fixes available that we know will work (the math really works..no more crapshoots). No sir, Walker has done what we asked and we should let him finish. Neither Dunleavy nor Begich cut it.

0,"Nolz, I suggest you take a course in post-modernism or eco-feminism - if you are  open to questioning traditional, male, """"objective"""" narratives.

0,"I have no guilt over our past history. It is what it is and there's nothing that anyone can do to make it change. What I'm sick of is that part of history is being used as a weapon of motivation for division instead of a lesson of history.  I was raised in the military, my dad served 20 years, and I served over 23 years. Very rarely did I witness any racist actions. I'm not naïve enough to think it wasn't there, I just never witnessed it.  My first girlfriend was black, my best man at my wedding was black and I adopted his mother as my own as she was the sweetest woman one could meet.  I am sick of our country being divided by race. What ever happened to being judged by the content of one's character?

Are you an extreme environmentalist that hates oil and gas with a religious zeal?  Are you the smaller oil company killer that worked for Bill Allen at Veco's as it's V.P., Mr. Bill Barron that worked as the former DNR Director of Division of Oil and Gas that increased lease sale terms up to 8,000% in Lease sales when oil prices dropped 70% and no one bid on the millions of acres in the 2015 Beaufort Sea Sale?  You priced everyone out of the lease sale NO one Bid but they still have not fix your 8,000% increase in rentals and the Cook Inlet oil lease sale had million of acres and hundreds of tracts was held this month and no one bid!!  DNR 8,000% increases are killing lease sale and the state has to make things better or no one will invest in Alaska. HB 247 is the only thing saving Alaska!  Who are you? Are you in a hospital and are you allowed to be online?
