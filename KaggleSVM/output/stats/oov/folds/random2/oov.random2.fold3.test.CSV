0,"Yes, he did win the electoral college by a good margin, but he still only got 49.2% of the votes. Would have been a much different story had Ross Perot not run and bled off the republican votes from Dole. Bill did even worse in 1992, getting only 43% of the vote. I would call Obamas two elections landslides because he did get more than 50% of the vote in both elections and actually fairly large majorities in todays political climate. Not so Bill, in either of his two elections, no matter what he got in the electoral college.

Tara Jollie...you can stick your head in the sand and pretend we don't have a fiscal crisis...you can pretend that its all so simple...but if is was so simple the legislature would have already done it.  Vague generalities run rampant in Alaska...just look at the republican senate majority and their cut government screed. We need less of that, not more.

0,"The balance of payment occurred when consumer spending crashed due to high interest rates 1982-90 and the housing bubble borrowing in 2006. This means marginal spending is on imported goods.

0,"I believe the last quote in your article. The obsession about looking young and living long really baffles me. Been told I am unfair on the former because I have been """"blessed"""" with youthful looks, though I would prefer a rugged face with winkles here and there. I have told myself I would be happy to live as far as it takes for my children to be independent and take care of themselves, but I have realised that even though my parents left us with nothing, by nothing I mean leaving us without a place to call home, no money to pay for our education or food or anything. Somehow granny's social grant  and that lady who owed a corner shop being prepared to loan us a bag of maize meal every now and then managed to get us through. Today I am 52, have a decent house, cars and a pension to assist my kids with their education and other things. Afraid of death? No. Want to reach the age of 100? No...75 wll be very generous.
"
0,"The source of the illegal firearms is NOT an argument for having tens of thousands more private legal firearms waiting to be stolen. Look at Australia and gun crime, after their last mass murder, and the buyback of private weapons, gun crime has fallen. And CONTINUES falling. Do your own searching. Illegal guns will always exist. Having legal guns in society only increases the number of illegal guns floating around in murderous hands. Grow up. Your holster doesn't make you a man.

0,"That Christie sure is powerful.    Her policies of driving up the prices of housing in BC have also impacted prices in Edmonton,  Toronto and several other cities in the country.

"
0,"Agree, but the UH d-backs must be watching too many NFL games; if the guy across from you is clearly faster than you, it is foolish to lie up in their face (without a back-up safety). The outcome is inevitable. Was it a player decision or coaches instruction?  Recall jj's style of play allowed UH to beat teams that most definitely had bigger, faster players. Of course, the goal was too simply outscore everyone. Tomorrow's game will be very telling.

My question is how do you know what the Spirit has taught with such certainty, that you can identify what is a contradiction? If Francis does not think there is a contradiction, why do you? And I am not asking with a tone of “you don’t know” but of curiosity about how you can be so certain of such a fuzzy thing as “what the Church teaches.”

0,"Patrick:  """"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""""  If you read it, you will notice that it's all one sentence.  There is no period or paragraph break between the part about well regulated militias and the part about bearing arms.  I do not for one second believe that the drafters of the bill of rights wanted to put in a clause encouraging armed insurrection against the United States. That whole notion is B.S.  What I believe the 2nd amendment is about is Southern (slave) states being alarmed by the constitution giving the federal government sole authority for standing up and equipping the army, they were worried that the slave hunting militias that they kept to hunt down escaped slaves could be disarmed by the federal government, and insisted on the second amendment in order to ensure individual states rights to deploy and equip (slave hunting) militias.

0,"I honestly can't see any sensible buyer purchasing one of these quickly built, boxy condos - and at prices close to half a million for some!  When the Denver market cools, which it eventually will, these condos will be impossible to sell and people will go underwater on them in some cases. Instead of paying a large mortgage to essentially live in an apartment, to just continue to save for a downpayment for a real home is by far the wiser option.
"
1,"No.  Catholic clergy, both priests and bishops, are still deeply into child sexual abuse and cover-up.  They are simply not to be trusted on anything relative to sexual morality, including contraception.

"
0,"I approve of lashes with the cat-of-nine tails.  Such punishment is more humane than locking a human up for years in a cage.  But lashes would not provide the jobs to the criminal justice industry that jails do and therefore, lashing sentences will never be used.  I have no problem with death penalty for child rape depending on what you mean by rape.  Obviously such sentences would not be applied to cases where all involved parties are children.  You motley stoop to distortion when it comes to crime matters.  Saying I would prosecute no sex crimes is known to you to be false, yet you say it.  No it is much more complex.  Forcible intercourse is a very serious crime for many reasons (not as bad as murder).  But many actions today that draw life felony and sex offender status are very petty by any objective standard.  Best way to determine the relative severity of crimes is to ask people which of various crimes they would prefer if they had to experience one of them.

The irony of giving people advice that shows you know absolutely nothing about investing in an article about giving bad advice!  ;)  But even more funny is the fact that you had been saving for 20 years for a down-payment which means you completely missed the trough from the last crash and paid three times as much for the same house!  In other words, your own actions and situation completely invalidate the point you're trying to make, that you should have not rented for 20 years instead of buying a home in 1997 or even 2005... hell even 2010.
"
0,"Folks complaining about how the HonSA doesn't cover certain articles that has potential for political blowback can only look to when the merger between the Advertiser and Star-Bulletin took place and it became the sole daily in town. It was then supported by Inouye. Consequence was that HonSA  was able to control the """"Party"""" propaganda message even more tightly.
"
1,"Carpa, you can stop hyperventilating. 1) It's not leaking when a private citizen shares a non-classified memo he wrote with the press. 2) If you think that anything Comey said matters at all to Bob Mueller and the FBI, you are being foolish. Trump is anything but vindicated at this point. Perhaps at the end of months or years of investigation he will be vindicated but he is in deep legal jeopardy at the moment.
"
1,"He'd never do that.  He makes way too much  money off the suckers who buy into his religion and sucking off the public teat. Religious welfare is right up there there with corporate welfare.

People like that are well aware of and critical of Trump's flaws (both political and personal).  I'd have gladly voted for Kasich or Rubio over Hillary Clinton.  I have yet to have an intelligent, rational discussion with a Trump die-hard.  They tend to be incapable of such interaction.

That figure dipped only slightly among Republicans, 62 percent of whom said he should release them.""""  Even a near-2/3 majority of his own party 'cares'. So, who is """"out-of-touch"""" here?
"
1,"You think that taking down the statutes of Washington and Jefferson is funny.  The black bishop, James Dukes, of the Liberation Christian Church in Chicago believes that these great Americans are white devils ( Malcolm X terminology) and is demanding that Washington's statue at the corner of 51st & King (entrance to Washington Park) be removed and the park's name be changed.  Dukes does not believe this issue is funny.  Dukes belongs to the same Black Liberation Faith group lead by Jeremiah Wright, Obama's pal.  Wright said Pearl Harbor was a lie and that he hated both America and whites.  Obama never disowned Wright;  naturally, the lying progressive MSM gave the racist Obama and his racist pastor a pass.  Black racism is perfectly acceptable to the globalist MSM.  But if a tiny fraction of Southerners are racist, then according to the MSM (see Dobbs above) all Southerners are racist.  Take a walk on the South Side, white man, preferably after dark and see if you survive black racism.

"
0,"The most recent studies of evangelical protestantism, done during the last few years, show that the evangelicals are also losing members - of all ages, but especially young adults.  Many of the young adults are leaving their home churches for the same reasons young RCs are leaving - what they see as hypocrisy, rigidity, a focus on the sexuality of others, and misogny towards women. Ironically, few of these churches bar the divorced and remarried. If they did, their numbers would drop even more, because of the high divorce rate among evangelicals.  The Baptists are also losing members.
"
0,"Stopping others from having abortions is NOT the most important issue. Making sure the  person in charge of the nuclear codes is sane and responsible IS--or else many more people will die, including those already born as well as fetuses.  No matter what you think about what is a sin objectively, it may or may not be a sin for a particular individual in a particular circumstance to have an abortion herself. But it is not a sin to allow another person to make up her own mind and follow her own conscience. If you think abortion is always wrong, you should be working to convince people of that, not relying on the government to do your convincing for you.  Besides, Trump doesn't really give a rat's arse about abortion. He's pretending to to get votes from those who want the government to force everyone to follow their beliefs.
"
0,"Americans were demoted from citizens to consumers long ago. We are the little cogs that keep the corporate wheels turning.

1,"What? This is sob story central? Why is it that every black pro-football-wanna-be player has a sad story to tell? Without a doubt, there is some sorta heartbreak associated with a black player being drafted or trying to make a team. Geez. It becomes a worn out welcome mat. Can't you report a story in a positive light instead of constantly reminding readers how so and so and such and such overcame adversity just to land at the footstep of stardom? As for me, this constant detailing of a player's hardship is worn thin. Maybe they should try working a demeaning, demoralizing job. There are plenty of hardworking people who view the NFL as an escape from life's daily travails. We don't need to gather at the trough to commiserate.

You may remember that former presidents Bush and Bush openly declared they could not vote for him.  Sensible people from both left and right are united in opposition to his dangerous presidency while his shrinking base of weak minded individuals and anarchists are hoping something good happens even though they can't agree on what that would be.  Anger and frustration with the status quo has never been the type of support that has staying power.  Those same people will soon discover that Trump has no answers to their concerns.

Go to language schools, and you will find most of the students are either ambitious young professionals in their twenties, or retired people.  The problem is that without practice, you lose it. In North America where the language is English, it is easy to immerse yourself in it, so easy to learn, not so for other languages.  The biggest factor is original level of literacy. Trying to teach a foreign language to people who are barely literate in their own is very difficult.

As you stated we have had a robust immigration policy for decades and for the most part we have been welcoming educated and well off immigrants as well as refugees.

Many entrepreneurial immigrants are using business connections to import goods and services into Canada.  I don't blame them. They are making the best of our free market and connections they have.  If we want to reverse this tread we should be sending Canadian business and technical people abroad to establish trading footholds in countries we can export to. In other words let's promote a robust Canadian expat community around the world.  Finally in my experience in corporate life I see a great many New Canadians in the corner office.

What's the pay back period for a kitchen or bathroom renovation? Or, an automobile? While you're at work, a grid tie system will generate power into the system. Why not make  some money? In the long run, it will pay for itself and then some. I agree that subsidies shouldn't be necessary for an industry to expand or exist.

For years people bought these homes as they came on the market and restored them to their original if humble splendor.  While this preserved the architecture and family oriented neighborhoods it also added great value to the overall community because homes and towns were so livable, and truly unlike anything people could find elsewhere.  Once the area was 'discovered' by New Yorkers and others with great wealth, the beautiful examples of Americana were torn down to build McMansions used as weekend homes.  Towns were left with completely inadequate zoning laws on the books to prevent this, and newcomers sued towns when and if they fought back.

Often these businesses were set up to benefit the """"family"""", with different classes of shares owned by different members of the family. The share structure is such that you could pay dividends on one class of shares to the exclusion of another. This takes place as a regular course in publically traded companies.

0,"Doug,  To my knowledge neither of those situations are as you describe.  It was always known from the get-go that the Queens Quay platforms would need to be rebuilt to accommodate the new longer articulating multi-car streetcars. The engineers had to work to the spec of the existing streetcar stock. New streetcars at that time weere many many years in the future.  Same thing but different with Saint Claire. Even though the Hawker Siddley UTDC cars were on the way out but were still the rolling stock of the day and for years more to come.. The new cars were coming, but really late and not when agreed to.  Bombardier being late and have serious quality issues has caused numerous disasters for the TTC.  The cost of alone of pushing the existing streetcars beyond their operational lifespan is a huge expense every month. Re-using buses from other parts of the city to cover the most heavily used streetcar lines costs pile of money each and every day too.

Too often people forget there is someone else on the other side of the screen, who deserves the same common decency we would most likely give in-person. So thank you!  With that aside. I do have to disagree with Johnny. I have been honored to work at a Department of the Interior in the past. You wouldn't believe the lengths DOI goes to, to make sure tax dollars are not misspent. And most if not all DOI initiatives come from the executive branch/senate (whom are elected officials) and not the government employees themselves. I worked in the Bureau of Reclamation (deals with water and dams) and I've never worked with more humble, qualified people (mostly PHDs & scientists), who most often take a pay cut to work for the public good. Now not every agency is run like that, but making such a blanket stmt as yours mischaracterizes the ethical work of other agencies.

If the fare were to go up to $6 or more, I would have to seriously reconsider whether or not driving makes more sense.  If it were to get to $7 for a round trip, then driving would be where I would go.  Some of the outlying lots cost in the neighborhood of $100 a month to park, so the fare is already close to that cost.

You can have you concept of what constitutes a """"baby"""" but that doesn't make it so and it most certainly gives you no right to attempt to foist that idea onto other women who are as responsible for their own worldview and capable of making the right decisions as you are. Babies are babies. Murder is the taking of a human life and that most certainly does not apply to a creature that has not even drawn a breath or developed enough to live outside the womb.

The fact that development has pushed so fast into that huge area of town, where people might build too fast and depress property values in the central city is SCARY to the people building these big fancy buildings in the central city. So they are working to slow or prevent development out there so that they can continue to profit.

His operative conclusion with which I agree is: """"The next Conservative leader should have no great difficulty in forging a platform that emphasizes tax cuts and a balanced budget, increased defence spending, a renewed emphasis on free trade, parental choice and a cautious approach to immigration. Such a platform would unify the caucus and membership and might appeal to a plurality of Canadian voters.""""  As to how well some of Bernier's libertarian inspired policies may go over with the general electorate, I think Max is astute enough to know that success in politics means putting a little water in your whines just as fellow libertarian and Ayn Rand fan Rona Ambrose has done in 13 years in politics.  Sunnier ways, a new tone and a fresher face are welcome.  But candidates will profit from The Harper Formula of economic and fiscal conservatism blended with social moderation.

It should concern us because, historically, civility is bound with order in public discourse and when it is discarded there is an inevitable downward-spiraling effect.  The darker impulses within some human beings are only kept in check when society expects a certain level of courtesy and decorum in public life. But when leaders set an example of incivility, even if just for show, it gives these people the wink and nod they need to come out of the shadows. Once in the open, they easily find each other and mob mentality takes over.  This is what Trump must take ownership of. He may think of his undisciplined rhetoric and bombast as mere theatrics, but his more hateful supporters don't. He needs to understand that his words, whether sincere or not, have consequences.  But I don't think he gets that and I'm not convinced he has the capacity to learn. That is what scares me the most.

It is largely the tradition of the pre Vatican II model of Church which was stunned but not shattered by the Vatican Council, the pieces of which have been reassembled with an absolutist vigor by JohnPaul/Ratzinger/Benedict. The danger for those of a more Francis I minded bent is to seize upon the seeming validation and blithely assume that it is equivalent to a """"weapon"""" against/for. It's not. It needs careful parsing, nuancing, and appreciation, not only of its value but of its underlying critique of ourselves, our institution, our vulnerable history.

Of course, I'm talking here about gay priests who abused young men, almost destroying the Church.  And don't give me that BS about those priests being pedophiles, rather than homosexuals.  Most of the victims were boys, and 75% were too old to warrant calling the crime """"pedophilia.""""

0,"Mr. Wielechowski, Many people may disagree with me here, but I am willing to pay up to a 5% income tax, and up to a 10% sales tax to make this state amazing for future generations. However, my hesitancy is on the past spending record of Alaskan legislatures, which is downright scary. AND, with the concession of a combined income tax and sales tax I would expect the corporate giveaways to be ceased and the state budget to be cut. No raid on the permanent fund. If the state cannot, like every other state in the US, pass a budget funding government with a sales tax/ income tax, corporate/ oil subsidies removed, and cuts to government, then we need to start requiring an IQ test for elected officials. Also don't pull a Walker and say in November we all get new taxes that are due in 2 months, make it a year and a half out to ease the blow. Fund the govt. off savings in the meanwhile, that's what savings are for after all.

The resolution in itself was a hate document aimed at the current administration in DC. President Trumps name and office were specifically mentiobed more than a dozen times...and yes there was a large public outcry, not a few people, against the resolution as written. So now its been rewritten, and actually presents no benefits to the citizens of this beautiful loving little hamlet they do not already possess.

The premise you have a cold engine that is 30% less efficient after 2 blocks, EG the short trips you speak of, is not true.

I don't know how they do it but they do have their John Jay Reports and they go through royal commissions and inquiries and they say all the right stuff and write up policies....but then you hear of individuals who are trying to find justice and compassion. These are real people suffering through legal proceedings because the 'changed church' still keeps ignoring them, even now, or refuses to do what is necessary to help them back on their feet. If victims have the gall to do this then this 'changed' church comes at them with everything they've got, partly to stop precedence and thereby stop anyone else possibly seeking to go down that path. I know of two people going through this very process right now, even amidst this 'changed' church. I also suspect why they so want to have a redress scheme (in Australia)... it will save them millions. It's interesting that the most 'unanimous' conclusion that the 'changed church' has comes to, is this redress scheme.

When I got into his office we went over several things in regards to this individual.  As I was leaving his office, he stopped me and said don’t forget the rest of his files!  There were two more boxes full of more files.  This guy had been in and out of jail, on and off probation, and parole (which can have concurrent or consecutive times), had multiple cases, and even some federal time dating from the 80’s to 2000’s.

The testimony also covered extensive Russian involvement in current elections in France, the Netherlands, and Germany and the problems being exposed there. In the Presidential election the Russians used sophisticated targeting of media-- down to the demographics and the voting precints and states to target and the timing of media blasts using bots and paid trolls.

Trudeau opposed it.* He changed his mind. I suppose to some people it all make sense if you apply the right label. We may convince ourselves we know what a politician will do but that is a belief and not a certainty. To be uncertain about Trump is perhaps a better approach to politics than the certainty provided by partisanship (?).  *I think elections have always been fought on emotion and not fact.

So your preference is that huge numbers of tge population be kept from seeing the doctor so that wait times are shorter. Don't you hear how weak that argument sounds? Secondly the the vast number of people in the US who look at the two choices 1. our current system where they will never see a doctor or 2. Socialized medicine where they will see a doctor a few months from now (by your estimate) which do you tgink they prefer? My last point is that your claim that health INSURANCE companies are the driver of innovative new drugs is laughable and patently false. If you want to make the 'profit =innovation' argument (which I wouldn't agree with) then it would be the drug companies who need the freedom, not health insurance companies.

Claims of somebody being Russian (though, I expect that 98%+ of those accused of being Russian in comments sections are not Russian at all) are used as a tool to discount what the person has to say, and to attack them. So, it truly is real racism, because it is disregarding and discrimination precisely on the premise of race.  A lot of people just try to rationalize their racism to justify themselves to be able to say the discriminatory things they want to. But that doesn't change that attacking somebody and suggesting that their views are invalid on the premise of their race being Russian is racism, and is no different than a Nazi doing the same to somebody who is Jewish because they are Jewish, or a KKK calling a black person's views not of equal value.

Now, the way the global financial system works is this: once you have an asset, a country etc. that is considered desirable, you then get specualtion and hypthecation on top of that: this is where you get the rapid price rises. It is caused by the cascading credit flooding into the market from many sources.  The only way you can stop this is either to stop the free flow of capital, alter the financial system and end speculative finance, or, as most Central Banks do, mess about with currencies and interest rates. Since Canada will not do the first two, we will see the Loony be devalued downward to ease the pressure.

No matter what, more data could only make them more effective in their work.  As to your latter point: criminals get guns on the black market because straw purchasers easily elude police. Tracking sales stems the tide of illegal guns because of this, so over time it would be much harder to illegally obtain a weapon. Right now, it's ridiculously easy and it's all because we don't give enforcement the tools they need to put bad actors in jail.  Anyone obeying the law would suffer a minor inconvenience and/or expense at worst. How many lives is that inconvenience worth? There's no question that more data would assist with prevention, though.

Yes, I have home earthquake insurance (but for cost reasons with a high deductible) but no flood insurance as the chance of flood at my house are thankfully close to zero. Acts of nature are usually predicable and need to be carefully considered before buying any property anywhere. As a geologist I think about these things.

0,"I'd like to hear from pro-daycare Que. advocates as I have heard that this program has boosted the birthrate and stabilized enormous stress while giving disadvantaged children much needed daycare. To my mind, daycare is as crucial as education and healthcare. It's only required for each child  for a limited time and must be provided.  The column does not discuss the likely claw backs that occur in the Que. tax system for most users.  Also, the hefty price could be cut by 2/3 by going to $21/day, if that were thought wise.  It costs about $26K/yr when a mom goes on welfare, not for the welfare, but for the funds, taxes, economic participation, etc. that are lost along with life prospects and the invitation to poor health in future due to poor diet and extreme stress. It turns out that caring for children is good business, as well as the right thing to do.

0,"""""Why do we write about the Knights of Columbus?"""" The universal language of Big Money is corruption, the anti-god that  bedevils theology/ history. As for Rome, it happened in the time of the Crusades with the Knights Templar, and thereafter, with the sale of indulgences across Europe to build the monument of monuments, St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. That lesson of history lives with us in the present time. The corruption story of money in Rome, in High Power and High Church bedevils faith in our time. Soldiering for Church has been the history of Knights, the armies of Church Militant. Even St Ignatius of Loyola picked up on and promoted Church soldiering and violence in the global Colonial enterprises of Church. Pope Francis, like St. Francis, means to speak a different language in Church, but the contrary winds  of Church History are strong in the present time. Who will end up winning the culture war, the message of St. Ignatius or St. Francis? The question is personal to each of us.?

0,"As a former liscenced therapist for sex offenders this raises a red flag. I liked the folks I worked with and some were able to undergo a change of life style and mind set. But it took work. Offending in any form is about power and control. If one has issues of power and control this usually comes from some sort of trauma or abuse- not always but many times. The seminary folks should have known and given him time to get some treatment and work through the reasonings of how and why he CHOOSE to become involved. This would take a lot of work. It seems this was a s step he passed by. Again the issue of patriarchy in the church and our institutions is paramount. Not all folks who walk away from a hate organization can truly be priests. But I am not saying never. Just not having the married or female option gives me much cause to worry that some folks are getting passed on because of their gender and not vocation.

Unanimous  sources mean nothing, as they are but a playground of supposed information, muckamuck, not valid information.  Should one wish to relay said information under the rules of the Whistle blower act, than fine.  Let them do so.

Obamacare had some degree of compromise. It wouldn’t have gotten enough Democrat votes without some movement on the details. Clearly full-blown socialized medicine wouldn’t have come close, and even socialized-medicine-lite didn’t get a single GOP vote. But guaranteed the above mentioned names would have voted for the broader issue. It’s a key principle for them.

To the extent Heritage had an idea similar to Obamacare, they were wrong. Oh, and nice racist drop.)

We need to have information to fully understand costs and what our compassion requires to be carried out for Canadians and new arrivals.  With respect to asylum seekers coming directly from the USA - sorry I see no reason whatsoever to even process such a request.  A boat of refugees from a war torn country is a very different scenario.  Lastly we had a program for people from Haiti that expired last year (the US one is still in effect).

Sure the state may make more money but at what cost to the citizens?

Ms Freeland's speech today, coupled with the trade outreach to Asia & the EU & with Canada's strong stand with Mexico in opposition to overbearing US tone & substance of a Mercantilist nature regarding NAFTA, is important.  Canada under the Federal Liberals is doubling down on its post-WW II internationalist/nationalist policy and dialling back (but not fully abandoning) its relationship with the US.  Arguably, this is the appropriate direction for Canada & it remains to be seen whether the Government (& Canadians) are prepared to assume the burdens entailed.

Or is there something that says he has to play for a team that picks him up after release?  If he is not obligated to sign a contract with the Broncos then doesn't that mean he wants another chance to play and prove himself?  It seems like that would be a big positive for him and the Broncos both.

1,"Bonhoeffer said it best: """"Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed &, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one’s prejudgment simply need not be believed- in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical – & when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self-satisfied &, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for than with a malicious one. Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous. (1)

Instead, they say the point is to immediately incapacity the threat. It is also common for police to do what they call is a double tap which means multiple shots to center mass which is why almost in every case, multiple shots are fired. Add in the fact that most police now carry high capacity semi auto pistols (16 shot magazines), this encourages a lot of shots being fired in rapid succession. In the old days, they only had a six shoot revolver so they were not as trigger happy.

0,"You haven't read the recent article on the SA where Krook Caldwell is now gunning for our property taxes to get the $14 billion dollars since the GET tax extension was shot down. Simple math: $14-billion dollar rail cost / divided by 537,000 home owners (960k residents in Honolulu with a 56% home ownership estimate from the city) and you get a special assessment tax of about  $26,070 from every single home owner. So you are correct, my initial estimate of $29,883 was a bit off by slightly over $3k dollars. LOL  In either case, every single resident will get a nice tax bill whether via property taxes, GET taxes or other means. This rail tax bill will be fairly devastating to most as $26,070 is way more than most have in their savings/checking account and could use the money to buy a nice new car instead.

In rural Alaskan villages, most people have very early memories of seeing an intoxicated person and have seen a close family member or adult friend intoxicated by the time they reach the age of 5 - this says as much about the family and community demographics of rural Alaska as it does the amount of alcohol consumed.

0,"Okay, why should an adult be in a minimum wage job in this economy? We the taxpayers provide 13 years of free education, more if someone can't afford even community college. There are numerous vocational programs to earn well over minimum wage while you learn your trade through union programs. And many employers give raises for good work and longevity. The Burger King down the street starts unskilled workers at $11 an hour, per the sign in the window. So why should adults be in a full time minimum wage job, year after year?  Are you saying no one is poor because of bad life choices?  Yes, some people fall into poverty because of circumstances beyond their control. But you can choose to finish high school, learn a trade or profession, keep your love life in control by choosing partners wisely and not making babies at 17.  Raising minimum wage reduces the number of unskilled jobs available. Fast food is preparing for $15 min wage laws by introducing kiosks all over.

The family can decide how to use the money.  Important too is the effect on people in the work force if more join it. More competition for jobs, more unemployment, lower salaries. More unemployment means a further load on taxpayers. Lower salaries, more poor.  So money so that the poor can stay home to look after their kids would be a better solution. That is an investment in children. And easier on the taxpayer.

And as a part of God's action, every sacrament is a mystery that cannot be fully contained within human thought and systems.  If you want to treat the hierarchy as a purely human structure, you can pursue that idea; it might even add to our understanding of the faith. It would be a novel idea in Catholicism.

0,"""""There is no friend anywhere,"""" perhaps you should learn more about John A. MacDonald. As long as I've understood drinking problems I've known he had one, but everyone knows that. A more recent discovery for me has been an editorial cartoon from a mid-to-late 1800s (19th Century) edition of a Canadian newspaper or magazine. In that cartoon Sir John is standing in the presence of extremely impoverished, starving First Nations people. He has a bag of money that is clearly budgeted for those starving people and he is handing it to a fat-cat business-corporate-industry person behind his back.  That cartoon speaks volumes. For one thing, it shows that cheating Indigenous People was a known corruption of government and business at least 100 years ago, and as much as 150 years ago. The media knew it, and therefore the people also knew it.  MacDonald gets """"bumped"""" to a higher denomination bill, and that is more, much more, than he deserves.

0,"Part 2 E2, on the other hand, appears to me to be an alliance of """"elements of Catholicism"""" with """"elements of fundamentalism"""" based on shared certainty about values of rejection, of opposition, of rejection of socially controversial, disputed moral propositions. It is at its core an alliance of convenience against others. The movement does not envisage rapprochement  among its members; rather both sides agree not to acknowledge or face or confront what they actually feel about each other. The Catholic element (conservative Catholics) do not relinquish for one moment their rejection of the core beliefs of the Fundamentalist element; and vice versa. Of particular importance in assessing E2 from a Catholic perspective is that a very significant portion of fellow Catholics (progressive, liberals) are as much the target of E2 rejection and enmity as a subset of secular ideologies. Not sure, but suspect something similar is the case on the other side. Therefore, E2 is not Church to Church.

0,"The Lake Vostok data showed repeated cycles of global warming and cooling over a 420,000 year period closely correlated with fluctuating CO2 levels, however the 420,000 years of Vostok data showed that the natural fluctuations of CO2 never exceeded 300 parts per million.  Today, the atmospheric CO2 level is 402 ppm.  In the 1830s the atmospheric CO2 levels were 280ppm, so they have increased by 122 ppm in less than 2 centuries, a faster rate of rise (by orders of magnitude) than natural fluctuations ever caused.  Almost all climate scientists believe that the excess CO2 in our atmosphere is anthropogenic, and that that excess CO2 is causing climate change (a very complex process in which the vast majority of excess heat is actually changing ocean temperatures more than air temperatures).  Climate change is happening whether you or Beckster or Trump believe in it or not.

0,"Some how, some way, something must be done about the bycatch of both halibut and king salmon. We hear about all these efforts to """"reduce"""" bycatch and WASTAGE of these valuable species, while the fishing for less valuable, high volume species goes by unabated for decades. Don Young once said that the pilot houses of these enormous ships have the equipment to discern what types of fish are in the water under them, yet somehow the skippers can't seem to avoid these horrendous bycatch levels where ever they operate. We need verifiable catch monitoring by independent monitors on each boat, at industry expense and accountability for each ship. Not fines, not just requirements that bycatch be utilized, but loss of permit shares, suspensions for multiple seasons, and criminal liability. And of course, greatly reduced bycatch limits. As Alaskans we should not allow this """"tragedy of the commons"""" to continue as practiced by outside interests.

Kudos to Francis because this is a sorely needed switch in emphasis in a world that is regressing into a 'me first tribalism'.  I just wish he could grasp how the current priesthood as it's configured and as he supports it, is a counter witness to the rest of his papacy.  For all his complaints about clericalism, there has been no change in the core concepts that produce and encourage clericalism.  Hence the failure to promote justice for abuse victims and the lack of change in accountability streams.

They weren't regular army soldiers, but that is what they most closely resembled in their activity, not criminals, and the activity they were engaged in was not terrorist activities, and when captured, treated, they merited treatment as POWs, including no torture.

It is actually a good deal for the utilities when they pay for the excess electricity ESP. from solar. The reason is that solar occurs during their high demand, when utilities typically use their highest priced generators for that (typically a turbine running nat gas). So, if the solar can knock down that high demand esp during the summer, it allows a utility to really lower their costs a great deal.

That's not to say that this is the result of their religious. Rather, being better off financially and better educated both makes you less likely to commit crimes and less likely to be religious.  In the case of acts done in the name of religion (such as blowing up the children's concert) you have to attribute it to religious belief since it's made explicitly so.

In the meantime, the households should receive supportive services aimed at raising their incomes either through employment or disability benefits, as well as help applying for Section 8. Some households will inevitably be unable to pay rent on their own and will become homeless again after the assistance ends if they don't get on Section 8. Others will pay extremely high percentages of their incomes in rent, which is an unfortunate reality for a growing percentage of extremely low income renters in America that do not receive a subsidy such as Section 8.

It's not a civil conflict with warring groups vying for political power. It's a GOVERNMENT violently turning against a minority of its people on a massive scale.

It will not only cut a lot of people out of insurance and reduce the benefits you currently get, it will reduce the tax revenue going to Medicare (it was in the ACA which is being cancelled including the tax revenue measure).

Seems like shooting to kill is part of the new trend for technology to make life easier for someone on the job. But in my opinion risk of injury or death is part of the job description. If someone is understandably not wanting to take the risk don't take the job. If cops were always brave they would be popular.

Now, none of that matters.  One day, in support of its burning and passionate desire to unify the Korean peninsula under Communist rule, the North will strike with overwhelming force.  It will be their military and geo-political calculation the West will accept the loss of South Korea when the alternative is clearly defined to Western leaders as the instant and certain nuclear destruction of many cities on the North American continent and in Japan.

Otherwise had we not cut them we would have done even worse.  As for tax cuts for the rich it's about the optimal point.  If too high, they can work very well like when Kennedy cut the top rate from 91% to 70%, Reagan from 70% to 50% and again from 50% to 28%, however Clinton and Obama's rise to 39.6% didn't hurt the US and Bush's tax cut to 35% didn't help so it depends where you are relative to the optimal level.

0,"A couple of thoughts on """"reneging on your promise to pay.""""  First, it happens all the time in the private sector -- companies and multiemployer (e.g., Central States Teamsters) plans go bust, and the plan is taken over by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.  And PGBC automatically cuts the highest pension benefits. To be sure, PGBC is increasingly underfunded, and that represents a challenge the Federal government will have to meet at some point. But there is a clear private sector path to resolving the problem of underfunded DB plans.  Second, in the public sector, changes to Social Security over the years (e.g., raising the full benefits retirement age) have effectively been cuts to benefits that reduced the actuarial unfunded liability. So even in the public sector there is precedent for """"reneging on your promise to pay.""""

In 1921, the Stockyards employed 40,000 people, and occupied more than a square mile of Chicago's South Side from 39th to 47th and from Halsted to Ashland. Chicago had become the meat-processing center of the world. The impact on Chicago - and on labor history - was monumental. The Stockyards story is teeming with strife: a bitter, ongoing struggle between labor and management, and ethnic conflict among strikers and strikebreakers.""""  See: Rerum novarum: or Rights and Duties of Capital and Labor, is an encyclical issued by Pope Leo XIII on 15 May 1891.

0,"Throwing """"more resources at the system"""" is not the answer.  The last thing the system needs is more judges and especially more lawyers.  The simple fact is lawyers are paid by the hour and the more work they create for themselves, the more they are paid.  Judges are simply ex-lawyers who understand this game.  If resources would be put into """"streamlining"""" things and limiting what lawyers can get away with...   I might support that...    but this will never end until the system itself is dealt with.  This is from someone who has spent 6 wasted years,  spent 6 digits of valuable money, and wasted countless hours of time of Superior Court Justices time, in the labyrinthine Family Law system.

It's not a set of opinions you can ascribe to. The need to eat food is not cultural. These people live in an area where purchasing food from the local mart is not an option. There are some groceries, but the prices are prohibitively expensive and many families will not generate enough income to afford the cost of surviving on store bought foods alone. In the villages, hunting is not cultural; It's survival. In turn the bi-products of a condition of living can be seen as cultural, but here they are born from necessity. Asking these people not to whale is essentially asking the village to starve. Chris should be very proud that he was able to help feed his community. I can't think of anything more important.

On average, a single 2MW, 328ft high wind turbine foundation pedestal is 15-20ft deep, and requires 750 cubic yards (30,000 tons) of Type 1 Portland Cement.  Portland cement is manufactured by """"cooking""""  a mixture of calcium carbonate, silica, iron oxide and alumina to a partial melt at 1450 degC (2650 degF), into a substance known as clinker, which is then cooled and ground to a powder. It takes about 440lbs (0.22 tons) of coal to produce one ton of Portland Cement.  Doing the further math, that's 0.22 x 30,000 = 6600 tons (66 railcars) of COAL per 2MW wind turbine pedestal.  Tune in tomorrow, and we'll move on to steel rebar and it's coal requirements, as that subject relates to foundation reinforcement for a 328 ft tall tower designed to support giant propellers in hurricane force winds....

0,"Bouncing a signal off the ionosphere can be used to make very secure communication by a very directional signal. To intercept such a signal you have to been in the path of it to intercept anything or in the footprint at the destination. The receiving end may only have a footprint 2 by 20 miles if not less. Ham radio operators often attempt things like this but an ionized ionosphere isn't very predictable. Only the Sun and meteorites ionize it naturally. The old troposcater communication systems (White Alice) were very inefficient with much of their signal lost in space and only a small portion of the signal made over the horizon to the receiving station. Satellite signals work well but due to their altitude they spread over an area of nearly half the US so almost anyone can intercept them.

Because her LGBTQ friends have always welcomed her, her compassion for that community is intense.  True, perception of fear and probability of harm do not always align. Just look at how people use anti-bacterial solutions or how citizens stockpiled guns and ammunition when Obama was elected. Many of my LGBTQ friends were psychologically stressed by the Orlando violence. They felt raw because they have experienced discrimination and hatred for most years of their lives. Now this. The author is primarily empathizing and offering her love and support to those who have supported her.

Why on earth can anyone other than the killers themselves support any organization that was responsible for killing 1340 innocent nearly born Alaskan lives ? On top of all this killing of the innocent , Planned Parenthood fights to keep parents from finding out what their under age daughters are doing. Women always scream no one has the right to tell them what to do with their bodies .  Why don't these same screamers accept the responsibility that comes with that ? All they have to do is use birth control and they won't get PG and find the need to kill so many innocent nearly born kids . Face reality ladies.

Every network seems to have an agenda they're pushing, with all but one (FOX), supporting the cold war that leans to the left of the political and cultural spectrum, while FOX and internet media going somewhat to the right politically, while supporting a more traditional culture that the country was founded on.

The Taliban offered to turn him over to a neutral nation for trial if we just provided proof of his complicity. There was none. Bush wanted war, and killed hundreds of thousands rather than seek justice.

0,"Psychology, like so many other disciplines, sciences, and technology, is a double-edged sword. It can be used for good and for evil. Many people today are exposed to the evil side of psychology while surfing the Internet. The popup screens with brightly colored backgrounds accompanied by an alarm and an authoritarian voice telling you that your computer has been infected by a virus and is uploading your financial information at this very moment is an example. These screens are psychologically engineered to induce panic in the user. In a panicked state, the average user is far more likely to do as the authoritarian voice tells them to do. The users simply seek relief from the stress the screen has induced so the thought that this may be a scam doesn't occur to them until it may be too late. Barring these sorts of uses, yes, psychology, or at least a basic knowledge of it, would likely be beneficial.

The foolish mainstream press is falling all over itself with praise for Trump's improvisational strike on Syria and he is enough of a fool to continue coveting that sort of praise more than he is prepared to do the hard work of thinking through a coherent foreign policy. Surrounded by generals, with the nuclear codes at his disposal, and without the capacity for sequential analysis, Trump is the most dangerous national leader on the planet today.

Rights and freedoms grant each of us an attribute, be it freedom of conscience, legal protection, equality, etc. We do not receive a freedom from hearing things we don't like, including discriminatory comments. This is more than semantics. It means that each of us must be prepared to assert and protect our rights over someone who would infringe on them.  Our rights and freedoms aren't passive. We aren't entitled to an absence of something that we don't like. We are however entitled to press, within the bounds of law, for the each of the attributes that are granted by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

In the previous nine years, economic growth averaged 3.4 per cent per year. 4) Harper's biggest screw-up was the two point cut in the GST which every economist warned them was a terrible idea, and was the main reason they went into massive deficit.

That leaves just the military option, which Trump and his advisors have stated will be used if diplomacy fails to de-nuclearize NK.

The same goes for airline tickets.

The Trump team plans to announce countervailing duties against our softwood lumber industry later this month, but the Trudeau government, which never succeeded in renegotiating a softwood lumber agreement while Obama was still in office, hasn’t even asked for softwood lumber to be part of any renegotiated NAFTA. Paul Wells launched a jeremiad on  how unpredictable Trump was, but Trump is keeping his promise to renegotiate NAFTA, while Obama and Clinton broke theirs, made during the 2008 presidential election campaign, to do the same thing.

Joking was frowned up unless it was related to castration of men. Never ask where anybody is from. Seriously.  That is a crime. Never say anything not in full  100% of support feminism, socialism, liberals and about the oppression of women.  Keep your mouth shut. Be careful about what newspapers you read at work. Never ask why there is always one female crying in the staff room every morning. Never stand up for yourself from male directed insults, groping, grabbing, blatantly sexist put downs.  You will only be told that because you are a man  its your turn.

There is NO situation where a pedestrian on a roadway is there lawfully, other than crossing at a pedestrian crossing.  Hope we agree on that too.  If we agree on both of those statements, it's obvious who was acting wrongly.  Would you DARE to do the same stunt in front of a car, which occupies its lanes under the same laws as cycles occupy theirs?  I find it inconceivable that peds think so little of their personal safety that they are ecstatic at the prospect of abdicating any responsibility for it to other, lawful users of Toronto's roads.

It cannot go into refineries but has to be 'upgraded' in a 'coker' to produce 'synthetic crude' which then can be refined into fuels.  (In some cases it can be converted directly into 'diesel' but not other fuels.) 3.  The best business model for Canadians would be to upgrade it to synthetic crude right here.  Synthetic crude is the cleanest and highest value crude oil.  Good long-term jobs, not short-term construction jobs. 4.  Shipping bitumen to the U.S. or overseas is the lowest profit venture for Canada.  But the Cdn. subsidiaries of U.S. oil companies do what they're told, so that the maximum profits accrue elsewhere.

It is a legitimate posit that private enterprise can be counted on to produce energy solutions when that overall cost factors make it practical to do so.  Despite your disclaimer regarding increased costs being minor, we still see virtually no wind or solar installations that pencil out economically without quite massive government support.  Trump is merely taking a path that provides less government control of economic activity.  Many companies and individuals are currently cash rich.  They are looking for investments that make sense.  At the present time, renewable energy does not make economic sense in terms of most bang for the buck.  It is a reasonable position to posit that private companies will move to renewable when practical.

In my opinion, I think he will order to move it on his visit. Lately, this topic has been in the news too often, as if someone is preparing public opinion for such a decision. Israel seems to be all but happy with Trumps, and the Palestinians are quiet out of fear of such a decision. A lot will depend on his visit to Saudi and what they may promise him if he does not follow suit with this plan.  Let's also not forget that Trump belong to a pro-Israeli church with wrong teachings about Christ, Muslims, and all Arabs at large. His daughter is married to a Jewish man that holds a high post in the WH. Chances are, he will declare it on this visit, and will cause more problems for people in the Middle East.

The only good thing about that would be that the Liberals and the NDP would be prevented from running amok with a majority and indulging their masters.  I certainly do not like the idea of the Greens being in a position to dictate anything at all with respect to electoral reform.

0,"I can't tell by your comment if you are a concerned Canadian or a Russian agent but this is a tired old narrative. Ms Freeland is not responsible for her grandfather's actions. Many people in the Ukraine during WWII had to make a choice to sympathize with the Germans or Soviets. Many people were taken in by the populist paper hanger from Berlin (including many Americans up until Dec '41).  Ms Freeland has done nothing but stand up to authoritarianism while in office and should be commended for her effort. And, she is correct in her assertion that the free world needs more resiliency and be less reliant on US leadership.  If anything, this should be a lesson to all of us to be wary of populist, authoritarian politicians who will say anything to acquire power. It is easier to blame a minority than to be tolerant and inclusive. It easier to deflect attention than to focus on real problems. And it is easier to rule by executive order than by building consensus.

Sanders is the only candidate in a long-time that provides an opportunity for real change.     Revolution is easy in our democracy.   Just go the polls like usual, but instead of holding your nose and picking what you feel is the """"lesser evil"""", write in Bernie Sanders.

At this time, the GOP was heading back towards being conservative.  And as to Jim crow, again, southern conservatives pushing confederacy passed those laws. The liberals fought against those. ACA idea was developed by Nixon, and PASSED by Romney in mass. The only one lying is you.  As to California, their debt is about 15% of their GSP AND DROPPING, which is actually pretty low.

Only after the war did we begin to say “The United States IS...”, speaking of the country as a unified whole.

Determining percentages is a skill that kids will need their entire lives. Mastery of the basics should be the focus.

They say that they want to make sure that vaping is accessible to adult smokers, and I believe them, but this bill removes important characteristics that make vaping successful. Every vaper I know has a collection of different flavours, because adults like fruit, candy and dessert as much as young people, but this bill would ban such flavours.  Vaping has spread quickly through word of mouth and Facebook, but the bill would make it a criminal offense to say that it's safer and more pleasant than smoking. They say that they want to make sure that Canadian regulations reflect science, but ignore much of the international research showing that vaping is vastly safer than smoking to both the individual and his/her surroundings and that vaping is not proving to be a gateway to tobacco. Every senator and every MP should be required to visit a vape shop and learn some basic facts before voting on Bill S5 -- they owe it to the Canadian public.

Schools are like that also. Public schools must educate all children, which means if a kid comes in with severe behavioral issues then they need to hire someone to watch over them.

They received tribute, soldiers, taxes and levies from all over the Empire for FAR longer than 200 years.  You think that if the Ottomans win their portion of WWI and retain control of Palestine and the rest of the Middle East, that they would have just handed control of that oil and all the wealth it could generate to the local Arabs, the same Arabs that revolted against them with the British?

Asa  matter of fact, they gained seats back in the US Senate and HoR.  The GOP had held a majority of governorships and majorities in state legislatures for a few years now......which means that if you think things are bad, then the GOP also had/have their greasy handprints all over the steering wheel.  How's the weather is Moscow?

They are in Fort Mac., Edmonton and Calgary.  We have visited these places many times in the past 35 yrs and Alberta's infrastructure  is actually some of the best.  You people in Alberta, especially the public sector, have done extremely well in you're hourly wages and benefits , especially under the former PC's. You people actually have the highest paid police, fire, EMS, nurses and teachers. Your trades people, which my family members are part of , have some of the highest wages in Canada.  Yes, the former PC's squandered your oil revenues, but, from what I have seen in your 2 major cities, the infrastructure is doing great.  So stop with this false narrative.

0,"unemployment remains high because the people we have don't have the skills to do the jobs we need.  We are also going to have the highest population retirement rate in the history of this country occurring in the next 10-15 years.  For every person retiring, there will need to be a trained, skilled employee ready to do that job.  Immigration is needed for that because even if we start pumping out babies now (and most Canadians don't) we won't have able bodied workers for another 20+ years.  Carbon tax will hurt, yes.  It's unfortunate that such drastic measures needed to be taken to change behavior, but many (I amoung them) believe its necessary.  You can disagree -- totally your right to do so, but like the environmentalists in the US have little power to resist their anti-environmental agenda, you have very little power to resist the pro-environment agenda in Canada till the next election.

That's the absolute truth that none of the Clinton detractors will ever admit, that all their screaming about criminality, criminal lying, and corruption by the Clintons is a fabrication, propaganda from the giant and hugely expensive Republican propaganda mills, nothing more than a brain worm implanted in the weak minds of the extremely gullible, like our poster who regularly insists that Hillary is a mass murderer who has killed 111 people, she can prove it.

0,"Michael, while I understand what you are driving at and sympathize with your family's experience in Poland, you are wrong about the minimum wage. The relationship of minimum wage to the general economy is a very complex issue. Clearly if it rises too fast then it tends to impact small companies  directly and larger companies indirectly (because return to investors  is reduced) . However you have to balance that against the the purchasing power of people. If wages drop or lag behind inflation , people spend less and thus the economy recedes and many more companies are harmed. If you had studied economics you would know that the goal is to try to keep minimum wage increase at the same rate as inflation. Your references to FDR as a socialist are, frankly,  offensive. He was a great man...politics aside, and while you are clearly opposed to socialism, you show a STUNNING lack of memory when it comes to what side of the political spectrum was driving foreign affairs in 1944!!!

I think all those other disciplines/focuses need be separated from history. They can be integrated with history study, but often history is sacrificed to the more current and emotional issues which engage students but are divorced from historical background or anything that happened before the students were born.  Ask today's high school students what they know about 9/11.  There is a reason so many students don't know in what century our Civil War was fought or have no sense of an historical timeline.

The internal combustion engine has had a lot of technical improvements over the years, but is basically an extremely inefficient device. The only reason we put up with such engines is because gas is cheap, has a high energy density and we are OK with air and ground pollution, spending large amounts on a supporting infrastructure (drilling and transportation pollution, leaking fluids from vehicles, air and water pollution and resulting impacts on health). We are OK with the latter costs because no one gets a direct bill for those costs, they are external. Internal combustion = external costs.

Part of that is THEIR fault , in that they set and taught the morality most of us us as our lens for seeing all of this.  Part of it is ours, for we let it happen, by not walking out en-masse, by not demanding more, by not holding them accountable on every possible level.  It's NOT that they all need to go.  It's that few or none have had the stones to leave on their own out of shame.  Even pope Francis has backed off, so the game will continue.  I don't know what kind of man could NOT be shamed by these failures.  But so far, only words, only conditional (conditioned??) regret that does  translate to anything I can trust to represent real change.  Ultimately, the bishops are demanding that we trust them.  Right now, I still can't.

If “he doesn't need to” supposes there is no bona-fide question, the numerous articles in every Catholic media about conflicting interpretations that are diametrically opposed and mutually exclusive contradict you.  2) While there may be a variety of opinions on a matter of doctrine, once the matter is decided these less-than-magisterial opinions count for naught. That one cannot validly remarry without an annulment is a settled matter, which renders putative remarriages of that kind sinful.  Doctrinal development builds, not reverses.

Harvard hardly needs athletics to promote itself these days, given that it's funded by a $36 billion endowment (the world's largest for an academic institution) and has had 381 years to establish itself as the country's preeminent university.  However it's notable that Harvard won 9 college football national championships between 1890 and 1919, when it was cementing itself in the national consciousness as the elite among elites.  Yale won 27 national football titles between 1872 and 1927, and Princeton won 28 between 1869 and 1950.  Setting aside ancient history, the relevant question is how effectively Alabama or Oklahoma or (more recently) Oregon would market themselves without football?  Or Kansas or Kentucky or North Carolina without basketball?  These are all good schools but they can't rely solely on an elite academic reputation to keep their names visible in the national media.  Athletics helps them do that, year in and year out.

Look at the flood of people headed for anywhere to get out of Income Tax States, like California because the taxes will kill them. That being said,  you know there is nothing to stop you from sending money to the State. Why don't you and all your Progressive Friends send in 10% or so of your yearly gross. How about That?  Go ahead, or is it that you don't make enough to pay any taxes. Have you you ever even given to Charities? Go ahead Jmf, put your money where your mouth is.

0,"unfortunately a lot of the information is misleading. This for the most part is just for selling of newspapers and sensationalism.  This may be a western Canada (BC Alberta) problem but is fairly rare in Ont. Though I do support socialized medicine I also believe there is room for private medicine. If a publicly supported 'private' clinic pays $200 dollars for the overhead of a procedure, why is it  portrayed as being greedy if patients are asked to pay a fraction of this? And as a 'block fee' here in Ontario patients are explained to that the fee IS optional (govt rules/college rules) and they are welcome to come and not pay. What an appalling system. However if doctors in these private clinics are jacking up the prices to unreasonable amounts it is not right. Many of the procedural fees from the OHIP schedule have not changed in 30 to 40 years. Some have gone up minimally. A hernia repair paid by OHIP is $300. When I started my prcatice over 30 years ago it was $265. Is that fair?

Trump's jingoistic tough guy act was celebrated by the cable news outlets that inform Trump's world view as if he had just been anointed homecoming king, much as they fawned over Bush's """"Mission Accomplished"""" puppet show. However Trump and his novice foreign affairs team don't fully appreciate that the war in Syria is not a simplistic, binary conflict. It's a multilateral conflict that is lacking a simplistic good-guys-vs-bad-guys framework that Trump might understand. Instead, the players are all bad, and many of the players and their motives are the predicted fallout of the Iraq War (in which Iran was the biggest geopolitical winner). Perhaps the only upside of this mess is that Steve Bannon and the white nationalist fringe seem to have lost some of their White House power.

What the initial forward look stated was that, subject to several caveats, the accumulated DEBT as a percentage of GDP would go to zero by 2040.  Now it seems it may be 2050.  Where we are now is DEBT is about 31% of GDP.  Now, to reduce the DEBT to effectively zero will require DEFICITS (calculated annually) to become SURPLUSES -- something with which we are already familiar from the previous Liberal government.  Short-term I don't really have a problem with DEFICIT spending, although I will concede this year's $27-28B amount is pretty large.  And, the forward DEFICIT projections point to a DEFICIT about half this year's amount in about 3 years.  Hopefully that trend will be maintained in Trudeau's 2nd term.  But again, lots of variables in the mix.  Finally, let's not forget that Mr Harper ran up a couple of eye-watering deficits of $50B+ during his tenure.

Gadhafi was America's friend despite his nastiness until suddenly he wasn't, ditto Saddam and Assad. In Syria, Assad was too strong and had too strong an ally in Russia to be toppled by the US and the country descended into chaos while the US and its allies tried to defeat Assad, initially with the support of extremist groups like ISIS (funded by the US) then later trying to fight ISIS and Assad at the same time! Enter Russia firmly on Assad's side to do the only thing that has a hope of stabilising Syria.

They may have something to say in new trade talks, but we have a few things to say too, like stop impinging on our sovereignty vis  vis softwood lumber. We assess costs one way and they choose to do it another. If their way doesn't work so well then maybe they should consider switching to our system instead of extorting billions of dollars every few years.  If they get too uppity then just direct them to the issue of their GMO wheat and the 50% sales drop they had beginning in 2014/15.

I'm speaking generally here.  If the consultant was competent, then the report would have included a lengthy list of risks and opportunities in the current operation. This looks to be one such item, and it doesn't look silly or incorrect. Maybe that means the operation should change, maybe not. That's a larger question.  It is not a consultant's job to decide the best course of action in the end -- that's the client's job. A consultant's job is to provide real, solid information for the client to use. A consultant's report that omitted things like this would be an incompetent report.

0,"I'm troubled by the incident and by the Police Chief's comments.  No one """"had to"""" die.  From the description, the officers seem to have been perfectly safe on shore (behind metal barricades), and they could have fallen back further if necessary.  They were in no imminent danger whatsoever.  The guy was on a sailboat on a windless night -- he wasn't going anywhere quickly.  In addition, no civilians were in harm's way.  This was a guy firing randomly at the shore from a distant boat.  I'm sure it was frightening, but the odds of him actually hitting anyone sound quite remote.  The officers seem to have precipitated this shooting by putting themselves in harm's way.  They could have simply stood down and waited him out.  Instead, they charged the boat the benefit of any cover, surprise, or less-lethal options.  The fellow's death was almost a foregone conclusion at that point.  I hope the press will investigate this thoroughly and not just accept the chief's word at face value.

By not educating the broad public the Liberals have failed to adequately protect those who will start when this drug becomes legal - an expected 900,000 more people - and wait til the pot pushers commercialize this product - Harm reductionism is ruining this country not prohibition. Flat out wrong if you think strong messaging doesn't work from parents - it does. This evidenced by the 1980s when rates of use dropped enormously with the Just Say No campaign. The historical record and the worldwide rates of use further substantiate its success. Look at Sweden and other countries with low rates of use - they  have prohibition - with massive spending on education. The harm reductistists who say that marijuana can be used """"safer"""" are nuts - marijuana is linked through science to damage to reproductive health - dna damage and sperm morphology.

Eastern Rite Churches do not consider the difference to be merely in liturgical rite as Roman Rite Catholics often claim.  It was, in fact, the Eastern Melkite Rite that contributed significantly to Vatican II in regard to use of the vernacular language and concelebration in liturgy, collegiality and synodality in governance and a unique theological approach to Catholic doctrine.  Archbishop John R. Quinn explains the East-West diversity in his book, EVER ANCIENT, EVER NEW: Structures of Communion in the Catholic Church.  Discussion of the unique theological approach of Eastern Churches in union with Rome can be found on https://east2west.org/faq/doctrine/  As for possibility of a Vatican II Rite/Church, Eastern Rite Churches now in union with Rome were once condemned as heretical.  https://RiteBeyondRome.com

0,"2/2 This could be flipped into either a tri-level or four-leveled democracy over perhaps several decades without  excessive disruption. The key element should be a diocesan synod composed of all clergy and elected representative from every parish, with the bishop as president of the synod, but democratically subject to his synod for legislation.  The bishop would continue to appoint pastors, who would become presidents of each parish synod composed of elected parishioners.  If the Bishop of Rome were elected by all 5000 or so bishops, we would have a tri-level democracy. I would prefer to see diocese grouped into provinces of about 25 dioceses, and then have the bishops of each province elect one of their number to sit on a permanent synod in Rome. This permanent synod would elect the Bishop of Rome, and the pope would rule as prime minister (PM) of the synod.  The  PM forms the government (curia), but all legislative authority would remain with the Roman synod.
