0,"the driving force behind this bill is so the 200 million American tax payers have to pay for Obama care  2,500 dollars month that will go up to 4,500 dollars a month that will help pay for the illegals in this country so they can be covered by Obama care at the expense of these 200 million tax payers who have to suffer just so the 20 million illegals are covered that's the 20 million who are mostly illegals are the ones they have to cover,the news will not tell you that so get rid of Obama care and let the illegals pay there own way while sneaking into this country illegally don't feel sorry for them.

0,"I am not from the area but this unfortunate event was brought to my attention.  The devil is always in the details and I was not the one that owned that dog or put up the electric barrier.  But I do know that neighbor had a non-aggressive dog that like to wander.  She would throw herself at the perimeter, shock would knock her down as she past the perimeter.    She being past the perimeter would get up and run away.   Another neighbor uses it successfully on his friendly young miniature sheepdog.  These are use to prevent escape, not attack.  In Florida there must be posted bad dog; I do not know if all electric fences or sonic fences are equal, but know not all dogs are.  In split seconds people get tunnel vision  and if I had a small child under my care or even a puppy I would draw my gun.  In moving in to a new place I would have been more careful by scouting the area for dogs which is something I do.  I feel sorry for both sides here, but side more with the man that shot.

0,"Shawn O'Donnell - as usual, you don't have your facts straight.  When I came into office, facing a $20 million plus deficit, I immediately cut all executive salaries by 5 percent.  They received minor raises several years later, but by the end of my administration, union and non-rep employees had seen wage increases several times greater than the executives, mainly due to the outrageous contracts rammed through at the end of the Begich administration.  We made tough decisions, but we left Anchorage in the strongest financial condition in history, with well funded reserves, six years of budget surpluses, and a AAA bond rating.  Just the facts.

0,"all none citizens guilty of anything greater than a traffic citation need to be sent out of country, to their own, without recourse and without the ability to come here again. as far as the 'community' is concerned: if you feel bad, raise money to help this man and turn your miscreants in.

"
0,"The only thing Trump's ban has in common with any Obama policy is the seven countries selected. Specifically no Obama policy ever had a religious test that gave preferential treatment to Christians. It never ceases to amaze me how many people fail to understand the different ramifications between US being seen by the world as at war with a limited number of non-state international criminals who practice Islam and  being in a religious crusade against all of Islam. All 1.6 billion of them. ISIS is pushing the crusade narrative. Trump's ham handed policy makes him the ISIS recruitment poster boy of the month.

0,"Why don't reporters probe deeper? Deadline pressure? Inability to think on their feet? (i.e.: lack of experience?) Another question: aren't they taught this in journalism classes/lectures?  Yeah, I know: Ms. Doolittle spent 20 months on this """"file,"""" Lots of experience! (A """"learning"""" experience, I suspect, missed opportunities all along the way.) Another question: where were her senior editors' """"oversight"""" on this particular """"file""""? The tone of many pieces was """"Aha!  And what does THIS nugget suggest to you, dear readers?""""  Suggest it's the reporter's job to investigate that, not readers'.  So: the Minister of Justice thinks the Philly third-party """"external advocates"""" is terrific and Canada should adopt it-- the unfounded rate went from 18 per cent to 4 per cent.  To what effect? Are complainants happier? Anybody check with prosecutors?  Judges?  Are courtrooms clogged with unwinnable cases?  What's the CONVICTION rate now?  There you go, Ms. Doolittle...onward, please.

0,"So if you are not in lock-step with 100% of a churches theology you should stay home? Should this apply to all engagements a human being might be a part of? If my meet-up group has a couple republicans in it, should I boycott all meet-ups? If my gay partner disagrees me on the CRC should I leave them? Obviously flawed reasoning.

Unfortunately for him and for trump, the wall closed in and blocked their plans for subverting every part of the government and turning it to their own kleptocratic plans.

0,"This is a heartworming story. However, it is not compelling. It looks like a tale of someone walking down a dead end road.  This guy had his heart in the right place to start with but did not grasp the issues. Showering in cold water to save the environment? Get real.  There were/are lots of things he could have done to """"improve the plight of humanity"""" besides adopt a religion.  He could have joined one of many international aid agencies and worked overseas. There are lots of groups in Canada crying out for volunteers, too. He was just too self absorbed to look for them.  My sense is that Islam has not taught/will not teach him anything. He is still self absorbed, engaging in Islamic rituals that get one no closer to God than if they sat on a park bench and waited for God to walk by.  I doubt that he will find fulfillment in Islam. It has no respect for the environment which starts with having fewer children in a world of 7+ billion people.

0,"Donald Trump in the White House, and his mindlessly loyal fans, superbly personify the dumbing-down of the culture, perhaps even its culmination. It is the rise of floundering amateurism, of the blogs and the talk radio rants -- and the denigration of education, expertise, professionalism. It is the hollow triumph of The Common Man with all his peevish biases and reckless opinions. Suddenly, people who can't even manage their households would presume to manage civilized society. Call me old-fashioned, but I still want my science done by SCIENTISTS -- not by the good old boys in the Oval Office or in anonymous online gabfests.

0,"Unfortunately Symmetre, this is a political class problem, not a con/lib problem.

Anyway, in short the system needs to change. Don't hate the player hate the game (or the players who make up the game as they go along...).

Well, the last thing I want to do is insult a fellow veteran (Army-'63-'66), or lecture them on patriotism, particularly one who went to Vietnam or any other combat zone. But veterans, and others who serve their country/community in one capacity or another and who have sworn an oath to protect this country, should know (maybe even more than others) that these are serious times, requiring serious and thoughtful discussion.

0,"I'm surprised how many readers don't seem to have grasped the Globe's Civil Comments process and still blame moderators.  It's my understanding that every comment first has to make it past a peer review system.  If it does, it may still be flagged for consideration by moderators. (click on 'Community Guidelines' that precedes the comments)  I think it's fair to say that most Globe articles on feminism or immigration or muslims attract a majority of comments by readers who are against them.  I think we all have experienced the rejection of what we believe to be completely reasonable comments, but it's ironic that it's the people who dominate the peer review system who complain about it the most.  Welcome to peer review.

0,"Isn't a """"Troll"""" a derogatory name ? You don't like me because I am a Christian - I know that because I saw you and your buddy Eric trashing me (and it was  crystal clear). I have virtually no respect for your demographic, being a child of the 60's hippies - I am outspoken on that because I have first hand experience growing up under that generation. Your posts are just about anti-everything I believe in, and for me to say you are a bygone generation will probably earn me the title of troll - but my opinions and observations are valid and held by many.
"
1,"Agreed. The typical pattern of tyrants is to attack the media. In some cases, this has been not just threats of physical attacks, but actual attacks. Trump's thuggish behavior and attitudes have not stayed confined to him, unfortunately. Trump's campaign was accused of manhandling a woman from the press, and of course there was that con that body-slammed a reporter.   Spicey kicked this pResidency off with a bang, yelling about crowd sizes and demanding the media and the American people believe the ridiculous and unsupportable about crowd sizes.   This has GOT to stop. The cons should be policing this too. That is if they actually give a damn about this country and not just party.

0,"Jagmeet Singh can speak well and he can sell a story that sounds honest.  As Mr. Trudeau is doomed to break more and more campaign promises, which were never possible to implement in the first place, more and more people might believe that Mr. Singh when he promises the same impossible things.  It isn't so much Mr. Singh as it is the Liberals being hit by reality.  However Mr. Singh might be able to sell the lie as well as Justin Trudeau could.  He certainly can come across as more honest about issues than, for example, Thomas Mulcair did as Mulcair always had the air of a career politician and opportunist.  Charlie Angus might have had the same effect of getting people to believe impossible promises.  Guy Caron, not so much.  Nikki Ashton would have been the NDP jumping the shark, or perhaps Leaping the shark.

Oh, wait, republicans have been in control of the house since Jan. 2011. They probably had a lot to do with the large jump in jobs after 2013, much more than Obama and the democrats. So tell me, how is Obama going to create at least 15 million jobs in the next three and a half months?

0,"Neither side is entirely innocent in this struggle, but Spain has really gone out of its way to squander every opportunity they had to hold on to Catalonia. While I would have preferred to see a negotiated settlement that would have extended more powers to Catalonia like devolution in the UK, Spain chose to be reactive and sought to preserve the status quo. They could have had a say in the composition and wording of the referendum, but instead simply opposed it then sent in troops to try and stop it. Catalonia is not innocent in this struggle, no people seeking a nation of their own ever are. But Spain isn't willing to do the work necessary to make Spain a nation the Catalan's want to remain in. Therefore, it really is time for them both to move on in their separate ways unless  Spain decides to change courses, and immediately, though it may already be too late for that.

But many had the bad luck to be born in countries that have too often had governments that are both inept and corrupt, led by rich oligarchs with no concern for the poor, including their own.  We can do little to change that.  Trump will drastically cut foreign aid (the US gives far less  than other rich nations as it is), which will add to the problems, pushing more desperate people to try to make it to a place where they will have a chance to live with more than they can glean in trash dumps.  My Irish ancestors came to survive, when there were no quotas. My German ancesters came to escape war - like Syrians?  Many Latin Americans come to escape extreme poverty and extreme violence  (see below) - literally  to save their children. Most would do the same to save their children.

That record was broken by an unnatural occurrence. A trucker on the Pipeline found a dead arctic fox along the road on the Slope. He thought it had been hit by a vehicle, so he decided to bring it home to Fairbanks and skin it out. The remains he fed to his dogs, which became sick from rabies in a few days. The virus was alive and well in the frozen, dead fox and likely was transferred to the dogs when they ate the fox and cut their gums on the broken bones they were chewing on. The virus has to be a transfer of body fluids into the victim's blood.

0,"Thank you for highlighting another side of the issue.  May I try to add a note of clarity (and keep it brief)?  The fact is that true dogmas of the Church (and there are really only three- the rest is doctrine which is what has changed at times) are not changeable.  The divinity of Christ, His Death and Resurrection, and the Assumption of Mary are dogma and not subject to interpretation nor alteration.  Doctrines are the layers and layers of Church laws or Teachings that are undergoing questioning now.  Doctrines have changed: one good example is the law that lay Catholics were never offered the Cup at communion, starting in 1416, and remained unchanged until Vatican II.  And another one is that no pope was formally declared as being infallible in teaching until 1870. This is why the doctrinal purist have fallen into such disrepute.  You can read all about this in many volumes and on-line via a Google search.  Disregard that """"unchanging""""  blabber...it isn't true.

I do not understand that coverage, I do not understand the editors' choices there.  When cops in Canada are shot dead in the line of duty, they make the main web page of this paper, often with multiple stories.  What is the editorial goal with that glaring difference in reporting? Is it to paint American cops as trigger-happy racist dangers to a scary society, out there slaughtering civilians willy-nilly, whereas Canadian cops are to be painted within an overall balance of landscape, as tender human stories with human tones, an outrageous and newsworthy and important event when one is killed?

The inevitable result is greed and corruption. The Olympic business model is essentially a partnership between the host country and the IOC.  The problem is that the former is guaranteed to lose money and the latter is guaranteed to make money.  More and more countries are simply coming to the conclusion that the benefits of hosting the Olympics simply do not justify the enormous expense.

0,"P.S.  The stakes in these situations are VERY high.  Landowners' interests (and ability to sell to developers) create friction with community interests in maintaining adequate livability for taxpayers, homeowners, existing businesses, and more.  Meanwhile, the white elephants (such as abandoned or lowest-value use of old strip malls, rental properties, etc.) present a challenge to developers, because they typically must first be demoed completely (including sewer, water, power, roadways, and even curb-cuts) prior to new construction in order to bring the parcel up to code.  Furthermore, more intensive use often warrants municipal investment beyond the site...on access roadways, arterials, in water and sewer infrastructure, and so on.  In many cases, the community  must trust the government to amass resources for infrastructure improvements and not squander the resources on other short-term needs.  This MUST be done well, but it can be done well.

Its economy has stagnated for almost 2 decades and Japan is facing an economic and demographic crisis.  Moreover, the per capita immigration rate to Canada has been relatively constant since the 1950s, and recent years have seen a steady increase in the education and skill level of immigrants to Canada.

While the majority of Canadians were shocked by the slaughter in Quebec and demonstrated their solidarity with the victims in countless vigils coupled with innumerable expressions of sympathy, a small but toxic online community instead injected poison and blamed Liberals, immigration and Islam.  What these seem to ignore is that every mosque that has been vandalized, every hijab torn off and every slur hurled has not only provoked revulsion towards the perpetrators but elicited an unprecedented outpouring of sympathy for the targeted. It is possible these incidents have even stimulated an increased interest in learning more about that faith. That would be poetic justice.

Quality can be a basis of differentiation and we should consider how country of origin labeling can play a role in maintaining this market growth.

These being Cree Trappers Association, Cree Outfitting & Tourism Association and Cree Native Arts & Crafts Association. And recently even belittled the Cree Women's Association publicly. While we penalize our trappers for ANY additional income on an already minimal income, as a director of Labrador Mines he was able to make 6 figure sales in shares without any penalty to his 6 figure income as Grand Chief.

From his point of view of the local economy, we are not at full employment here even though our unemployment rates are very low compared to the past. He disagrees with the report of a NY Times reporter reporting on various economic ideas about productivity and wages.  Fernandez thus agrees with Larry Summers, an economist who was the Bill Clinton's economic advisor, has said in the recent years and who, Paul Krugman and other macroeconomists agree with.  Our economy in recent decades has been based upon bubbles which eventually fizzled out. The most recent bubble is the real estate bubble which fizzled out in early 2008. We are really in the state of stagnation for about 30 years now. 5% unemployment rate is really too high. At 5% wages do not continue to climb anymore. We cannot continue to grow at a faster rate because wages are not high enough to stimulate enough market demand.  IIRC Krugman thinks that 2% is now the correct rate.

On average, a single 2MW, 328ft high wind turbine foundation pedestal is 15-20ft deep, and requires 750 cubic yards (30,000 tons) of Type 1 Portland Cement.  Portland cement is manufactured by """"cooking""""  a mixture of calcium carbonate, silica, iron oxide and alumina to a partial melt at 1450 degC (2650 degF), into a substance known as clinker, which is then cooled and ground to a powder. It takes about 440lbs (0.22 tons) of coal to produce one ton of Portland Cement.  Doing the further math, that's 0.22 x 30,000 = 6600 tons (66 railcars) of COAL per 2MW wind turbine pedestal.  Tune in tomorrow, and we'll move on to steel rebar and it's coal requirements, as that subject relates to foundation reinforcement for a 328 ft tall tower designed to support giant propellers in hurricane force winds....

If we doubled productivity that would be something to offset that, but most of those people went into service jobs. So with all those extra workers, what naturally happens is the pay rate drops. Law of supply and demand. Of course it's also true that people want more now. A three bedroom bungalow from the 50s or 60s was 1000 square feet with three appliances.

The reason Trudeau scored the biggest seat gain in Canadian history is that his party came from the farthest back (just 35 seats) in history to vault from 3rd to 1st place.  But his % of the popular vote at 39% and change was smaller than most previous federal governments including Harper's in 2011 and several governments won more seats than he did even though he was running in the biggest parliament (338 seats) ever.  Harper lost in 2015 by only by a 7% vote margin and only after being the 1st PM in history to win 3 elections in a row each one by an increase in vote % and seats.  And in losing in 2015 he suffered the same fate - voter fatigue and desire for change - of every PM since Laurier in 1908 after 3 wins in a row.  As to dragging Canada into far-right political territory, kindly cite 2 or 3 such far right policies after a decade of Harper in office.

With the slump in global oil prices, the project became unprofitable before it was started.  Neither Enbridge nor the governments involved chose to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Welcome to America. Guns are not the problem. Bad people are the problem, and there are more and more bad people because fewer and fewer go to church or have fathers present in their lives.

0,"The inability of local voters to modify land use decisions isn't the Judge's fault.  It was built into the system back in the '70's so voters couldn't circumvent what the Land Use Planners wanted.  The only appeal of a land use decision is to LCDC and then to the Court of Appeals or the Oregon Supreme Court.  Governor McCall and 1000 Friends of Oregon set it up that way to keep the voters out of land use decisions.  Otherwise, the City of Eugene could set a Growth Boundary, for example, and the voters could modify it by a referendum.  That is not legal.

He sees no contraposition with Familiaris Consortio but the Pope apparently does as he fully endorsed the Argentinian bishops' understanding of the Exhortation. Müller interprets AL in the same way as the Cardinals do, the Pope does not. Again you do not comment on the fact that the CDF proposed several alterations to the text because it was unclear and liable to opposing interpretations and none of them were acted upon. If Müller thought that the document was clear, why would he propose these alterations?

However, nobody thought to check if there was actually any public support for it. it took fifteen long years and a lot of replacements in both houses to get it rescinded.

Trudeau was a Gr. 2 drama teacher briefly, I think.  He must think small business runs like government -- over-spend and charge more, but private business can't do that. Small business owners have NO benefits, NO paid sick leave, NO paid vacations, and they must save for their own retirements. They also have to think about the costs for staff, equipment & office lease and associated insurance. NO public sector employee, nor MP, nor Prime Minister worries about the costs for anything -- how about Mr. Trudeau's $215,000 two-week vacation with the Agha Khan in Dec 2016, including airfare and RCMP detail? Lush gov't budgets, travel expenses, pensions, etc, by digging into taxpayers' pockets. Government is unaffordable. Politicians 'play' for votes no matte what the cost. Unsustainable.

The Brexit situation interests many Canadian readers. It's a large and complicated  issue with side-issues galore. There's PM May and her government trying to sort out a Brexit deal that best serves Britain and remains in keeping with the wishes of Britons that democratically voted to leave the EU. Then there's the EU itself,  represented officially by Juncker, and de facto by Merkel, furiously trying to keep the wheels from falling off the EU model. Their hardball approach, which will likely only stiffen British resolve, is clearly meant for the ears of other  member states that have an axe to grind with Brussels. In the end,  posturing and strutting will give way to money - like it always does. There will  be economic winners and losers on both sides. More reporting and less EU cheer leading please.

These countries are desperately seeking out any tax revenue they can get to cover these debts. This is the reason why they are flooding Western countries with cheap labour from the third world and also take any cash from the third world, no matter how illicit the source.  People looking to retire are starting to realise their government pensions are not worth that much because of inflation, and also that, having some assets, they are in the sights of tax raisers.

0,"While I concur with most of your comments, I'm not sure that the union is correct in adding to the costs. Adding more costs to the running of colleges will just increase tuition costs for the students. I, too, teach at a college part-time, and marking and other time is covered by the hourly classroom teaching amount. The college uses an informal ratio of two or three hours for every hour in the classroom for part-timers. The issue though is with full-time faculty, they are well paid for what they do. I've done the math, and the full-timers receive, when compared on an hourly basis, way more than the part-timers, as well as, they have benefits, a pension, and lots of time off. Administration  and full-time faculty costs are very high, and those costs should be examined, with the goal of keeping tuition manageable for our students. Many have to rely on OSAP. So, costs to run the colleges are high, and many students then incur debt to the government to pay for their education. Hmmm...

There is no fence at Devil's Churn, and also none at a wildly dangerous right side of the dune, where I witnessed a guy on my last visit ludicrously dangling off a rock to touch the surf with his toes. I hope he is still alive. But fences don't stop stupidity, the ocean is dangerous, and the world offers thousands of opportunities to combine the two.  But I do want to note that your notion that an Oregon beach is a n unrestricted highway made of newly dead clams is counterfactual—or at least very out of date.

You fired the first salvo.  There are quite a lot of employers who are indeed allowing employees who have medical marijuana certification to remain on the payroll.  There are tens of thousands of Alaskans who utilize MJ in lieu of alcohol and other illicit drugs and are fully employed.  You might want to refresh your knowledge of the subject.  Crime statistics are worsening because of people caught in opioid addiction combined with the recession.  I'll repeat, I'd rather have an employee on medical MJ than the alcohol abuser or opioid relier.

Of these most populous counties the US is ranked as having the best Healthcare system. The 2 major Healthcare programs in the US are called 'Medicare' and 'Medicaid'. These provide Healthcare to about 312 million Americans. According to the WHO Canada has the 30th best Healthcare system in the world. France is and has been the best Healthcare system in the world for the last 16 yrs. In Canada, eye care, dental care, drug costs, hearing  care, old age care are not considered  as 'essential health care'  so they are not provided for free in Canada's Healthcare system. 27 of 29 countries ranked better in Healthcare than Canada provide to its citizens, besides free medical care, free old age care, free dental care, free drug benefits, free vision and free hearing care for life. Its high time for Canada's 'Healthcare ' system to wake up and join the best of the world!

My point was that if police have not worked in their communities to gain legitimacy and trust from citizens, their body camera video will be viewed with mistrust rather than impartially.  So, police must be viewed by those who watch their video as fair and impartial if police want those who view their video to see it with impartial and fair eyes. That takes work in their communities, not just donning a body camera. Respectfully, Val Van Brocklin

The shortcomings of all of Canada's uniformed services are a reflection of weak leadership. 4  mounties died at Mayerthorpe because they were poorly trained and poorly lead. Parliament was penetrated so easily buy a zealot in 2014 because the doughnut eating clowns on the hill were poorly trained and poorly lead, and the armed forces has consistently failed to address issues of misogyny and racism and the treatment of it's members because the officer corps is more worried about their pensions, promotions and paycheques than their obligations.

0,"On the one hand the OH housing feasiblity study is missing the fact that in most cases building affordable Single, or Multi-Family Residences has left the building. The land costs & infrastructure hook-ups are prohibitive. The only way to remedy this in the short term ... is to allow smaller units for rent/sale to be built, maybe from 250-800sq.ft., and allow for less stringent codes for thing like paving & maybe consider shared septic systems for clusters of smaller homes/apts. There a shared systems already long ago developed just for this. $100-200K should be the goal, and look to modular design, as well as boat/RV design to maximize efficiency & convertibity of space & storage.  Second problem is the unfair & hidden motive of having land the developer bought zoned as agricultural, be anointed commercial, mixed/multi-family, etc.  It effectively boosts the land value probably 5-10. Ethically, it doesn't work. Mostly, Island County has been shortsighted about low $$$ homes/rentals.

For example, teachers in Oklahoma are said to be the most poorly paid in the United States, but when cost of living is factored in, Hawaii's teachers are actually worse off that Oklahoma's. This is happening across the board and the sector most affected is precisely the sector needed to raise worker skills and employability: public education. This extends to the University of Hawaii, as well, where the actual purchasing power of UH faculty salaries is among the lowest of any Tier I research university in the nation. Retention of the best young profs is becoming impossible - the best minds are leaving as soon as they can find jobs elsewhere. But the State Legislature and the BOR are blind to this glaring problem - they do nothing to address it. And unless Hawaii adopts the $15 minimum wage and does so quickly, we will all pay the price.

0,"Just one of the reasons liberal states encourage illegal immigrants is for the Census. States get Federal Representatives (and electoral votes) based on total population NOT just legal residents. California alone would lose much of its political weight (several electoral votes) if the illegal population was deported. It would be great if the Census only counted LEGAL residents. That would make the liberal states lose the political power but still be forced to provide aid for the illegals. We would soon see how """"compassionate and tolerant"""" the left is when they realize they gain zero political power form harboring illegals.

0,"Bill, as I read MSW's commemts about """"documents that mattered"""", I inferred what Cypress did.  I interpret it as saying that the very humanity of those in the truck gives them the right to seek their own betterment & safety wherever they can.  I think this would be a compassionate and tenable  position. I can also see legitimacy in holding the opinion that the rule of law and some controls on immigration have enabled the US to maintain the prosperity and relative freedom & security that make it an appealing destination for immigrants.  Maybe the 2 positions don't  have to be thought of as opposing each other.  We could strive to maintain the appealing qualities of the US while recognizing legitimate aspirations of all humans to economic security, freedoms and safety from threats.  (Meanwhile on the immediate issue, charging the traffickers with murder doesn't seem farfetched).

Firing Comey would show true ingratitude, and might result in Comey speaking out to the press about our mafia-pleasing Prez.  Only Republicans impeach presidents.

I liked how these quotes underlined that our ancestors weren't stupid. I saw an  argument there we still have, put very succinctly: if you tax corporations/persons too highly, they will leave, but also that corporations are lucky to be able to operate and make benefits here. We've given them special privileges against liability etc., and they have a responsibility to contribute back to that society. Healthy society = more profits. It's a balancing act to be sure, and less rhetoric and more plain speech would be welcome.

No surprise, the same thing followed Obama's two elections.  But hey, my equities and equity funds are at an all-time high, and my energy investments are pulling out of a long slump. Perhaps I will find excuses to excuse the inexcusable in the next administration? Unfortunately, a lot of Trump voters don't have equity positions in the coming economy; what will they do if Medicare, for instance,  disappears for them for all practical purposes?

0,"Actually, you are just way off in your understanding of these scriptures.   Jesus is telling them that divorce is only acceptable due to infidelity or adultery, this has nothing to do with depravity, or anything ongoing.  It was enough that if a spouse cheated, especially, if a woman cheated on a man, in Judaism, that the divorce be allowed because now that cheating spouse is deemed unclean under the law.  Therefore, Jesus is supporting the Law that the abused spouse may divorce but even if that spouse remarries, they too will still be committing adultery.   Jesus rebuked the practice of divorcing for any other reason.  You misunderstood the Cor. reading because you took the passage out of context. Cor:  29   For anyone who eats & drinks without recognizing the body, eats & drinks judgment on himself. 30 That is why many among you are weak. .""""  Paul is saying eating Eucharist, without belief the Eucharist is Jesus, is harmful instead of healing.  Paul did not say abstain due to sin.

In the first election after the resignation, they began the assaults on all Senators who participated in the impeachment process to force the resignation. These same Billionaire families continued their assaults to take over both Republican and Democratic parties.

0,"Even if one reduces """"pro-life"""" to """"anti-abortion"""", Trump cannot be construed as a pro-life president. Trump has launched a comprehensive, multi-pronged attack on human life and human dignity. He is presiding over the most pervasively anti-life, pro-death administration in history: he's eviscerated the EPA; proposed immigration policies and orders rooted in religious and ethnic bigotry, designed to divide families (one of which was struck down again today); violated every promise he made about healthcare in order to support a healthcare bill that will strip insurance (and therefore care) from millions of people (many of whom voted for him); proposed a mean-spirited, deadly budget that harms the sick, the poor and the aged. Do you believe that the nomination of a SCOTUS justice who may (or may not) vote to overturn Roe offsets the increase in (direct and spontaneous) abortions, infant mortality and maternal deaths that will be spawned by Trump's pro-death agenda?

0,"Thoughts on Trump & Putin:  1) Having spent more than a year  1959-61 as a GI  on the East German border along with hundreds of thousands of other NATO troops I'm disgusted that Trump seems willing to throw away some of what we were protecting; 2) Having spent the summer/fall of 1968 in the Soviet Union, where I experienced  a lot of """"mir i druzhba Amerika"""" and intense desire for a Free Russia, I was thrilled when Gorbachev brought about  democratic changes and  the freeing of the other republics  and satellites.  3) I was horrified  when Putin took over,  attacked that long awaited freedom and reverted to an aggressive foreign policy  4) Appalled that Trump has spoken approvingly of Putin's behavior and even jokingly asked Russia to hack an American political  party, and 5) Disgusted but not surprised that the DNC was favoring Clinton over Sanders, either because they thought she was a more electable candidate or out of old style political cronyism--sort of like the RNC and Trump.

0,"SSM support among Catholics depends on the poll.  I'd be interested to know what polls you've seen that put opposition to SSM at 70%.  In 2009, Gallup had statistics on whether homosexual relations were considered moral or not.  61% of those who did not attend Church regularly said they were, while 44% of those who attended regularly said they were.  But consider either of those numbers and what they would have been 10 or 20 years ago.  Also consider that younger people are more likely to support SSM.  Do you seriously believe there is anything which will reverse the upward trend in those numbers?  This year's Gallup poll shows record highs in the belief that gay sexual relations are moral.  They also conclude that over time there has been zero evidence of a shift to more conservative beliefs.  There is an even greater gap between what the Church teaches about sex and what Catholics who either go to Church regularly or not believe.

A subsidy is when the government, local, State or federal, writes a check to an individual or group.  Examples of subsidies are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAPS, Section 8 housing, PELL grants, and yes, the subsidy paid to so-called renewable energy companies building environmentally destructive wind and solar farms.  Another example of a subsidy is the rebate for the rich when they purchase an expensive electric or hybrid vehicle for transportation.

0,"Why do I get the feeling that they are just going to subsidize electricity costs using general government revenue?  The root of the problem is that, for almost 14 years now, the government has been signing tons of poorly written and poorly thought out contracts.  They signed guaranteed deals with a huge number of electricity generators, often for power we don't even need, all in a vein attempt at proving how """"green"""" they were.  In order to overpay for a multitude of solar and wind generating capacity they were forced to also overpay for natural gas fired capacity to be there for the times when the wind wasn't blowing.  Unfortunately there is very little that this, or any, government can do to get out of those contracts.  They can talk about """"smoothing out"""" the contracts but that won't CHANGE the contracts, just subsidize the costs today at the expense of higher costs in the future (and by """"future"""" I mean """"after the next election"""").

It concludes that lithium ion batteries have the largest impact on metal depletion.  Lithium ion batteries are also, together with nickel-metal-hydride batteries, the most energy consuming technologies using the equivalent of 1.6kg of oil per kg of battery produced. They also ranked the worst in greenhouse gas emissions with up to 12.5kg of CO2 equivalent emitted per kg of battery.

0,"So just how much money has flowed out of Alberta to Ottawa? A lot. Between 2000 and 2014, on a net basis, Alberta’s individual and corporate taxpayers shipped an estimated $200 billion-plus to the federal government. That’s what left the province, less what the feds reinvested here. At the height of the boom years that number approached $20 Billion annually - That is to say $20 Billion annually - out of Alberta and into all other provinces. - To put that lofty figure in perspective, the money lost is nearly 12 times the value of the $17.4 billion Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund. No other province — including Ontario, with three times Alberta’s population — even comes close to matching this province’s contribution to the federation.

The concern they have for their innocent passengers lives seems too low.   Nearly every time after one of these crashes we hear the same story---pilot error .

The statehood process was invalid due to the lack of required options on the ballot and United States civilians and military voting in the process.

Somehow it seems they figure they do not need us or any of their other friends, and since you can't tell these guys anything, they are probably going to have to learn otherwise the hard way. That of course assumes we have the guts to look for and focus on others for whom fairness trumps instilling subservient obedience. Given the extent, and probably dominance, of American money in so much of our economy, that is a daunting leap, but we do as a Nation have the policy tools to reverse that dominance over time.

The bill uses language about """"eligible recipients"""" so that the Executive Office on Aging will be able to define the kupuna's eligibility once the bill becomes law.  Also, the bill does state that the family caregiver must be employed at least 30 hours per week in his or her own job.  This bill is not seeking to address  all family caregivers nor all senior citizens.  It is addressing a relatively small population: 1) seniors who meet the limited-income criteria to be defined by the Executive Office on Aging AND 2) who are being cared for by family members who already hold down an outside job at least 30 hours per week.  The intent is to help both the kupuna in need of care and the family member who is burning himself/herself out because they are providing care on top of doing their own paid job.  The intent is actually to save money for the taxpayers by helping kupuna BEFORE they need to turn to Medicaid.  Hope this helps.

Military classification controlled by white, southern officers dedicated to segregation of the entire nation.  Alaska was, literally, ruled by a General Buckner, an avowed racist who implemented segregation policies throughout Alaska during WWII.  He ordered no black soldiers to be allowed to mix with local natives as violating his Old South code against miscegenation.

0,"As a childless person, I do empathize, however you have to understand the historical context here.  For decades, women paid the price by taking time out of the workforce to raise children and as a result, many ended up in poverty in their senior years, and at significantly higher rates than Canadian men.  So now, in order to address that problem (note that they succeeded), women who have children are in fact allowed a 7-year grace period after the birth of each child.  As to women paying more because they tend to live longer (they also tend to work longer), I believe there will be no consideration given to that until it is clear that the income gap disappears and the female poverty problem has been fully resolved - which may come sooner than later, given that women are now dominant in many areas of study and work.

Priesthood and parenting serve the mutual oneness of soul/ body, of Sacred Remembrance, inclusive in other-interest. Politics, like religion, should be intentionally Eucharistic, outreaching in prevision and provision. If the miracle of Eucharist is to have its effect, it’s up to us to make it happen!

That may seem like it held its own on the continuing screens but I'm sure we can assume that the 1/4 of screens that kept it were the best 1/4 to begin with. Even here, in superliberal Madison, WI, it had been on four screens and it lost them all.  Before I had predicted a ceiling of $5 million domestically for the movie. That has proved wildly """"optimistic"""" and I now am saying it will not reach $3.5 million. Its total through Sunday was $3,329,343. With continuing totals like Monday's $13,285, its now on life support. Adjusting for inflation, it will do less than 1/8 of the first film.

Gore lost and the street fighters won. So it has been ever since.  Whenever Republicans can find a loophole to circumvent the law, procedure, precedent, whatever it takes to win, they take it, and the people who vote for them register their approval by reelecting them. That means that if our democracy is being whittled away by the present Republican-controlled Congress it is because their constituents in their gerrymandered districts have allowed it. Something tells me that when the full implications of their actions dawn on them down the line they'll regret having supported people who violated two centuries of convention for short-term political gain.

Using a marriage broker or match-maker is viewed positively in isolated communities, which is what Ami did. Kids in such families would see this as normal.  The boys getting lost at night in Alaska is, sadly, how even old-timers die when in unfamiliar waters/areas even today. I know...I lost my g'father - 62 yrs in the wild - to just such a thing in '05.

0,"Because... er, because... lol  The reality is that any region may legitimately seek independence from the country it's part of. Ideally, if the separation goes ahead, it does so on peaceful terms. But it could also involve armed conflict. Armed conflict in pursuit of independence can be a legitimate and lawful way to achieve the goal.  What the West (and pretty much no one else) resents about Crimea is that the independence of a breakaway region is supposed to happen 'organically,' and over a long period of time. That wasn't the case in Crimea, as Russia quickly facilitated the secession of Crimea from Ukraine. However, the proof of the legitimacy of that secession is the peaceful manner in which it unfolded, and the peace that has existed there since.

There was a time when domestic violence and marital rape were not seen by society in general as being sufficiently wrong to be against the law.  That has changed.

Sadly, kids are dying from polio in Pakistan because it is too dangerous for aid workers to operate. The President of Turkey has come out publicly on numerous occasions saying men and women are not equal, that women belong at home to make babies but we can't talk about Turkey or Iran or Saudi Arabia or Pakistan or etc. because that would be considered Islamaphobic despite current state of gender equality in the 57 members of the OIC.

The Democrats never made a huge issue out of the hundreds of Marines who were killed in the Beirut embassy bombing either because they are above politicizing tragedy which is the direct opposite of how the Republican party has been operating ever since that unknown Governor from Arkansas defeated the head of the Bush dynasty back in '92.

The state cannot just cut benefits for retirees because to do so would require the state to shows its bankrupt, and with 50 billion in the permant fund no state or federal judge is going to buy that.

A lawless dangerous region that is facing famine and 3 million displaced citizens is not likely to be able to afford short/intermediate range missiles to aggravate the conflict further.  This has all the hallmarks of Iranian provocation and its' ongoing support of conflicts by proxy- Gaza City, Hezbollah, support of the al Assad regime, destabilizing the government of Lebanon, to name a few.  It is time to place sanctions on Iran.  It is not ready to re-join the ranks of civilized nations.

0,"Callwaiting - Does this belief spring from the information that some gay adults were molested as children and that the assault was causal to their later identification as gay?  I often hear the argument that sexual assault in childhood by a same-gendered adult led to the child's homosexuality.  But my take, as a former child protective social worker, is that kids get targeted by pedophiles because they are vulnerable or unprotected in some way. Being different-which gay kids often are-can result in kids being vulnerable and unprotected: isolated socially through rejection and neglect by parents, friends, churches and schools. Pedophiles seek a child upon whom they can act their own sexual needs; some prefer girls, some prefer boys, some don't care: all are looking for a child vulnerable and isolated in a way that will allow the adult to commit a crime undetected. That is why gay children are frequent targets: WE make them vulnerable to abuse.

(It's  a parallel situation to how people feared and denigrate Czar Nicholas of Russia until along came the Communists who were an order of magnitude worse). Khomeini was also a liar, accusing Israel and The United States of orchestrating the Grand Mosque seizure of 1979, which resulted in a mob attack and destruction of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad. In fact, the violence in Mecca in 1979 was the work of Islamic insurgents. The totalitarian regime in Iran is persecuting its own people with restriction on their freedoms and institution of a compulsary oppresive religious atmosphere. As far as the Iranian regime's nuclear ambitions, they certainly have had a major nuclear industry, and have masterfully played on the fears of other regional powers (Israel, Saudi Arabia) as well as the rest of the world.

Donna Brazile said,  """"At last I found the document that described it all: the Joint Fund-Raising Agreement between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund, and Hillary for America. The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff.""""

Yet, they don't rally to object  to having those little black boxes the manufacturer of the vehicle and the insurance companies install to monitor their driving. There are other devices using a combination of the internet and GPS than can monitor every move a vehicle makes. I don't doubt those movement can be tied to the changing lights at an intersection. The solution is decide how to, not if, something needs to be done to reduce accident, including related casualties at intersections.

So I would be highly doubtful of visions of Joseph Smith when he started a religion, 1800 years after Christ began the Church with the appointment of Peter, the first Pope. If his vision was authentic, the religion certainly distorted the main basic tenets of Christianity over time.

The positive regard for diversity and equality that has taken hold among the younger generations as well as Vatican II Catholics, is clearly seen in all aspects of our culture.  The Ecumenism of Vatican II is to thank in large part for the shift that had the Church and secular moving in the same direction on a few key issues.

0,"The real presence in Communion is only real when ingested.  Before so its an icon and after it is bread for the body.  The focus on confessing each mortal sin and all the various scruples around confession - and on receiving when sins are only serious in the eyes of the Church and not in real life - and the old practice of priests having to get every word of the consecration correct at pain of mortal sin all speak of magic and superstition.  The literalism on divorce is superstition and bad proof texting.  Indeed, talking about the validity of marriage rather than accepting the need for divorce is rank superstition.  I feel no victimization.  Just pathos.

0,"The owners of this country don't want truly free & autonomous untermenschen who might think for themselves & not follow orders without questioning authority. Perhaps that's why they require knowledge of so many things that won't be used or helpful in the student's future. We should focus on making people strong, capable, and self-sufficient so that when they graduate they move out of their parents house, and have livable wage job skills, and are truly emancipated. Then they can decide if they want to go back to school to get a degree. With so many young people with degrees out-of-work and trapped in their parents basement it's obvious we're failing in truly educating them. Knowledge is s'posed to empower people, not fill their heads with useless """"facts"""" that are in a lot of cases merely propaganda, and certainly will never again be used by the student.

0,"I agree that it happens, more than likely depending upon the Parish Priest. Anyone can walk into Mass  anywhere they are not known and go to Communion. Ultimately it is up to the person. There will be those who will construe this practice if it becomes commonplace as 'Catholic divorce'. One might ask that if the divorced and remarried are permitted to receive the Sacraments (Penance and Holy Communion) through the application of the internal forum, why via the internal forum can they not have further Church weddings? I Interpret St John Paul's teaching on ecumenism as being in hermeneutic continuity with the teachings of his predecessors because he cannot reverse it. What I object to is any 'ecumenical' activity which leads to indifferentism, the Assisi gatherings for example. As I said, I can only guess what your interpretation of AL is. I will stick with FC until the Pope says otherwise. Btw, that comment was the same 'uncivil' one I posted earlier, I just copied and reposted it.

However, in this instance, there would not have been a significant icing issue at 2,500 feet in September (maybe induction icing, but since this is a turbo-prop, it is not a factor).  I have several hundred hours in the C208B - almost all of it under IFR Flight Plan.  It baffles me that this flight was not conducted under IFR.  Certainly, the Operator (RAVN Connect) has access to current weather and NOTAMS that would provide the information to make safe and timely decisions on the proposed flight.  When in doubt, fly IFR.  Do you know the difference in initial and operating costs between a C208B (Single-Engine Turbo-Prop - Unpressurized) and say a BE350 (Twin-Engine Turbo-Prop - Pressurized)?  When profit margins are minimal, you use the tool you can afford.

The hijab is a sign she is FIRST a Muslim. but an American secondly. . She is loyal to a country only to the extent that does not conflict with Islam. Therefore, Muslims must denounce any person, politician or country (which is in fact any western democracy) that does not uphold Islamic submission to Allah.

The bill would allow states to repeal ObamaCare rules that prevent people with pre-existing conditions from being charged higher premiums.

0,"""""The most important debates take place in caucus, away from public view.

And the Senate leadership group is dominated by outer-islanders who dictate what happens on Oahu, but who have no accountability to this island's voters. The bickering in the Oahu delegation has left them divided and out of power. The result is that 70% of the state are pawns to the 30% who are on the outer islands. Maui, with just 12% of the population has nearly triple that power in the legislature. This is largely because of Souki and Roz Baker.  This has been the recent power dynamic, evudent a clear bias toward raising extra revenue on Oahu and spending it on the outer-islands, while failing to tackle the growing problems on this island - the state's economic engine.  Let's hope that fresh winds of change sweep away the stink of the current senate leadership group.

The truck driver was probably (I'd guess again, like most all of us) driving too fast and upon seeing a car and woman next to the road, should have been off the loud pedal, moving as far away from them as possible and ready to brake with his foot on or over the brake pedal. I wonder if he even slowed down at all.  Safety is no accident. Safety comes with proper driving techniques and attention, not just keeping it upright and between the lines. Even driving a truck by a person near the road requires attention, especially on a gravel road. How about flying rocks hitting a pedestrian near the road? Any truckers want to talk about that?

Your other options are to abandon the analogy or show me where my logic fails.  Citing empiracle evidence suggests you are attempting to use scientific method to determine factually whether God exists or not. Science is good at examining the physical universe, but useless at examining that which is conceptually outside the physical universe. How is that logical?  On the other hand, over 500 people witnessed Jesus alive during the 40 days after he was killed, a few wrote about it, at least one of whom was an eye witness to all of those events, the writings were widely circulated and spoken of contemporaneously so those who were written about could have refuted it, but none did.

Then we had a long string of deficits.  Christy Clark's BC Liberals have balanced the budget for the past 5 years in a row.  Horgan can promise to balance the budget, but not only does he not have a track record of doing it (because he hasn't been the premier in BC yet), Horgan is following the approach that Harper used in saying that by eliminating waste we could have both tax cuts and balanced budgets.  I expect an NDP government led by John Horgan to produce large deficits with a very weak economy.  I expect large corporations to stay away from BC if Horgan puts his platform into effect.  I expect business investment to plunge.  I would rather have Christy Clark as premier and be reassured that the balanced budgets will continue instead of taking a chance on John Horgan being able to balance the budget.

He has brought the office of the Presidency down to the level of his reality-TV show.  IMO, that is an embarrassment to all Americans.  I invite any Trump supporters to make the counter-argument.

These are not 'foods' any smart parent puts on the table.  Sugar should be taxed out of its existence.   Children have a right to informed parents and a good diet.  These needs ought not be incompatible.  Just serve normal home made food with no added sugar, or baked goods where you control this your- self.  It's easy and it's cheap.

0,"Last week I spent a couple of hours in a plane seat beside a Chicago cop heading to Las Vegas to celebrate his 20-year anniversary with the force.  I shared a story of a 15-year-old who was shot to death by sheriff police in a nearby small town.  I explained the honor-roll student was on LSD, had stabbed his father and another person, and was cornered by police.  The bloody 4-inch knife was in his hand.  Police twice TASERed him to no effect, used non-lethal bullets, and then put the K-9 dog on him.  The boy shook off the dog from his right hand and as the dog went for his left hand a sheriff’s deputy used an AR-15 to put a lethal shot to the boy’s chest.  Anticipating my question, “I’d kill him,” the cop replied as I ended my story.  The police and the General Conference seemingly have limited options to force compliance.  But does God have no choice but to force compliance by eliminating the non-compliant?  Is Heaven (or church) without everyone actually Heaven?

0,"I totally disagree.  Everyone has a right to their own opinion.  That's not in question.  And yes, the fact that they wrote it down in a public forum (texts can be tracked and they always become public even if you think they won't) definitely makes it worse.  What I think as I walk down the street sometimes surprises even me, like 'Wow, where did that thought come from?"""" but I have filters that prevent me from speaking or writing those comments down.  As soon as either of these two clowns thought of those comments their filters should have kicked in and prevented them from making them a reality by writing them down.  The fact that they texted them anyway proves how invulnerable men feel in this society.  They are not sorry for what they did, they are only sorry they got caught.

Well, they got what they wanted. Now let the bishops defend Trump's every word and deed. Seems to me they have a responsibility to do that on a daily basis since they helped elect him with a slim majority of American Catholics putting Trump over the edge. So far all we've gotten out of them is crickets. I expect that to remain the case for as long as Trump remains in office. Profiles in courage the bishops are not. But kudos to Fr.

The media does it because it sells. And terrorists commit terror for both those reasons. If governments and media stopped sensationalizing so-called terror attacks, the motive for their use would be greatly diminished.  Try searching for """"bus crash deaths"""" in your favourite news app. Here's what I get:  May 24, Dubai, 7 killed 35 injured. May 22, Mexico, 17 killed 31 injured. May 13, Turkey, 23 killed. May 7, Tanzania, 36 schoolchildren killed...  These tragedies are duly reported but they're not sensationalized. They get a column inch only, because they can't be exploited by politicians or the media. And this is true even though often singly, and especially collectively, bus crashes cause far greater casualties than any terrorist could hope to inflict.

The U.S. population has grown roughly 8% since 2007, mean that the debt level per capita may be more manageable that what it appears using an aggregate figure.

Just watch the film """"The Angry Inuk"""". This documentary examines the controversial Canadian commercial seal hunt protests by animal rights activists, which negatively impact remote Inuit subsistence hunters living a thousand miles away.

The objective is to accommodate other interests where mutually beneficial.The proposed amount of land to be Algonquin owned is 117,500 acres, 184 sq. mi., or 38 people/sq.mi.  4 The Algonquin have provided evidence and the governments agree that Algonquin traditional land covers 36,000 square kilometers.  All of it was “seized” by the Crown without a legal agreement.  The criterion is the land that they traditionally occupied, not the number of people. No private property will be taken away from anyone to settle the claim.

The system is what we have, and Trump has been elected. The system needs to change as the country has moved to allow any citizen 18 years and older to vote.

People of integrity act the same regardless of who is watching and listening. Sure, I've said things in private that I regret. I'd guess most people have, especially in their younger days. But Trump was a middle-aged man when he made those remarks. And he hasn't apologized; his repeated insistence that it was """"locker-room talk"""" just sounds to me like he thinks it's okay to spout vulgarities and disrespect women, as long as it's in private. Do you agree with him?

0,"I wasn't the one who said """"federal law doesn’t prohibit the discussion of classified information over unsecured networks."""" I'm not a lawyer, obviously. However, I did trouble to identify the author of this statement, one Steve Vladeck, professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law. He was also the guy who wrote, contra to your insistence that Comey's recommendation """"came as a complete surprise,"""" that it was """"completely unsurprising.""""  Comey's color commentary (""""extremely negligent"""") was highly irregular. And, as you must be aware, Comey told unhappy Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committe that “no reasonable prosecutor would bring the second case in 100 years based on gross negligence.”  I wonder how that investigation into Trump's Russian ties is going.

0,"The author cites the report of Joint Fact Finding Group as a """"thorough analysis of environmental and health issues associated with seed corporations in Hawaii.""""  The JFF determined that seed companies on Kauai applied 18 tons of restricted use pesticides that included 7.5 tons of active ingredients during a particular 20 month period.  In comparison to mainland corn production, the JFF estimated that Kauai seed companies were applying roughly 1 to 3 times the amount of different RUP insecticides per acre.  These RUPs can be harmful to humans in concentrations of only a few parts per billion.  Many people on Kauai feel they are being harmed by the RUPs applied by the seed industry.  However, harm to humans cannot be scientifically determined one way or the other due to deficiencies in monitoring.  The State Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health have been reluctant to perform the necessary monitoring.

Laws on books need to be implemented as well as registering abusers so when back ground checks are being checked, red flags come up, and a public letter monthly stating they are banned from owning or borrowing and any aid of supporting that individual will also be subject to prosecution. No stopping an abuser from selling or buying back a gun to relatives or obtaining one through underground markets or theft. These names need to be given to businesses that sell hunting, fishing and other arms store, so these guns can be linked back and businesses can be subjected to aiding in crimes.

0,"Agreed. This is about how people choose to perceive / interpret the President's tweet.  First, I'd to say to the """"Reporters Committee"""" that the Bill of Rights refers not to journalists, but to ALL AMERICANS as having the freedom of speech and to print (press) that speech.  Second, while President Trump's Tweet may be tasteless or moronic to some, and amusing to others, it does nothing to abridge anyone's freedom of speech (despite what the media claims), nor is it a statement of violence against the press. It is SATIRE. And satire is something that newspapers and other media outlets engage in routinely. It also is an exercise of free speech.  The media and this Administration have engaged in an all-out war against one another, apparently aspiring to see who can go lower. The greatest losers in all of this are the American people, who day after day realize that the monopolies on political power and media produce such poor quality as to be useless to meet our needs.

That requires active thought on a regular basis.  2) Big firm corporate law is a harsh lifestyle.

That may seem harsh but that is unlikely to change any time soon.

As for paying for solutions in Africa, decades of experience suggest this doesn't work.  The problem is with government and the national and local levels.  Most are corrupt; many are dictatorships, and none are going to allow outsiders to interfere with their governance.   Endless civil wars mean that militants/rebels steal the food and supplies.

0,"An income tax means that the state decides how much of the fruits of my labor I am allowed to keep. Our federal income tax is, in large part, a complex system of legalized plunder where money is taken from the people who have earned it and used to pay some of the bills of those who have not earned it through government programs. If private individual or groups did this it would be illegal. Under an income tax, politicians can buy votes by promising those who vote for them new or bigger programs that other people would be forced to pay for. They could say, “Other people are not paying their fair share of taxes”. The income tax is the 2nd plank of Marx & Engels “Communist Manifesto”. Our Founding Fathers did not support a direct tax on individuals because it was detrimental to individual liberty. They favored tariffs which are a consumption tax. A sales tax is a consumption tax.

If you couldn't guess, P1 = Goldschmidt, P2 = Blackmon and P3 = Arenado Add in Arenado's defense and you'd have to give him the MVP. Now if you don't completely disregard Coors numbers, I'd vote Blackmon. (Actually, I'd make he and Nolan Co-MVP's, but my glasses can be purple tinted at times)  My prediction is the voters will either screw Charlie and Nolan outright because of Coors, or they will just cancel each other out by splitting votes.

Not a cheat, but leading fellow Catholics into poor stewardship decisions.  And for the money, we don't even get missals that include settings (in any language) for the texts the Church actually gives us for Sundays for the entrance, offertory, or Communion.  The real scandal is the inclusion of blasphemous or downright heretical stuff:  """"I myself am the bread of life, you and I are the bread of life..."""" or """"We rise again from ashes and create ourselves anew..."""".

But these things are measured by bell curves, and there are always exceptions with every minority.  To believe that any member of a minority is incapable of learning what he needs to learn to become a productive and contributing member of our society is demeaningly racist.

We don't know what happened re: the stroller because the associated video deals with the aftermath of that incident but it does capture the male passenger's threatening actions.  We do know however that airlines have made flights increasingly more uncomfortable for passengers by overcrowding, less legroom, extra costs for just about everything, poor service in the crowded economy section etc, etc, etc.  So, while we might normally decide the crying mother with the huge backpack, twins, stroller (bar-b-que? tent?) might just be in an impossible situation regardless of the particular circumstances, we don't care.

Reports are that further investigation is being done into possible information or knowledge that can be obtained from others, for instance who may have witnessed or been on the receiving end of corroborating or exonerating evidence.   Could a grand jury indict an American Citizen for obstruction of justice based only on the evidence known?  Maybe.

Obviously, this is a time of great division and consternation in our country.  To be truly responsible, and before we put our thoughts into writing, we need to take a few deep breaths and think to ourselves: “Words do matter, Words do matter, Words do matter.”    Many people subscribe to the philosophy: “If you can’t beat em, join em”. However, the kind of negative labeling and name calling that many accuse our President of using cannot be used as a logical tool against him simply because for him as well as for everyone else, this is not logic.  Your mind is too fine a tool to be used for ad hominem abusive fallacies.  If we can lift our level and quality of thinking good argumentation will follow.

These are obvious facts, so why is it  beyond any logical person's comprehension that transgenders are born in a body inappropriate for their gender, or that homosexuality (often observed in toddlers, who know nothing of sex), also is as natural as heterosexuality is to those who oppose gays?  Seems too many people are immersed in their bigotry, believing in their superiority to anyone different from themselves, something that also applies to misogyny.  Trump consistently shows his lack of empathy and character, and his inability to represent all citizens.

So that is nothing new and has been widely taken for a long time.  It's just that the Israeli Lobby has had rational policy cowed forever.  The US has disproportionately supported Israel over the decades, not the other way around.  Were it not for the US Israel would have never made it. But under Netanyahu Israel has collectively shot itself in the foot, all the while trying to get the US to do the same by taking on Iran in a proxy war that would have been disastrous for us but not Israel. Netanyahu had no qualms about poking President Obama in the eye with his address to the US Congress, nor taking billions to develope both Arrow and Iron Dome.  Adding to the Israeli hypocrisy in their own nuclear weapons program that is never acknowledged but still condemns Iran.

People are 'kicked off' the markets when the insurers have to raise rates for everyone to cover the losses a skewed insurance pool will cause.  We have gotten to the point that without a single payer system American health care is going to be beyond the majority of Americans.  People in the middle class/upper percentiles are going to wind up paying vastly more for their own medical care than they would otherwise have had to.

Particularly when they 'describe' the various political systems.   The 'slant' changes about as often as the Secy of State's bureaucrats change their socks.  That's why the SoS has 'talking points'; to get out the current position of the current administration. The CIA, the NSA, the DIA and all the other intel agencies massage their 'product' to meet political needs.

0,"I can remember growing up in the 1940-50's in Ireland. We were constantly subjected to lectures and sermons about sexual morality. Both the so called """"Christian"""" Brothers and priests ranted and railed about the sins against sexual morality. They were the experts; they had a full understanding. We were the sinners; we needed forgiveness. The problem was then and is now, that institutional loyalty outrank and supersedes  all other issues for the hierarchy. What they really do not understand or accept, is the untold damage that has resulted from their misplaced loyalty. They have exposed the underbelly of hierarchical thinking within the church and therefore one questions all aspects of their decisions regarding faith; morals; and civil responsibility. They are the architect of their own demise. There is absolutely no reason to justify the continuation of the  commission; it is just another form of abuse, to obscure the truth and reality of what is happening inside the Vatican.

Rachael Harder went on record with her views on abortion during the 2015 election campaign when she filled out a questionnaire from Campaign Life Coalition, an anti-abortion lobby group.  One question was: ”If elected, will you strive to introduce and pass laws to protect unborn children from the time of conception (fertilization) onward?” She answered “yes.”  She did, however, say she would allow abortions where the mother’s life was at stake. (CLC had tipped its hand and said it wouldn’t consider that “abortion.”)  As a result of these and other answers, Campaign Life Coalition gave her a """"perfect pro-life"""" record.

0,"Wealth is a proxy for resources. Resources are required to live. So holding great wealth means having extreme power (life and death power) over a vast number of people. Libertarianism fights everything that dilutes this power (unions, welfare, public services, taxes etc) and often speak of the wealthy in almost deified terms ('job creators' for example). Inherited wealth means that soon one's entire destiny is determined by accidents of birth. Rich parents means you will be rich and powerful. Even if you are an idiot. And since you own and control all resources everybody else becomes dependent on your whim. Even politicians are dependent on you - so you end up with two laws. One for the rich and one for the poor. You have an aristocracy. This is not a flaw in libertarianism. It's the unstated intent of the whole thing. Already libertarians like Peter Thiel have openly declared that 'freedom' is incompatible with democracy. Thiel played a major role in giving the white house to Trump.

Let's call a spade a spade. This initiative is being bankrolled and sponsored by outside environmental groups on a crusade against resource development with a few local residents to put a friendly face on it. I challenge the author to point to one example where mining, oil and gas, or construction have eradicated a salmon watershed. Susitna-watana couldn't be more dead.

No doubt that a priest could molest a child, and that first incident (or many) could go on undetected until somebody complains.  The first problem is that many DID complain, and the bishops did little, and in many cases, weighed in on the side of the priest rather than the victim.  Messages were sent when they did this, which could create cancerous """"sub cultures"""" among the clergy.  Ultimately, when the antics of these abusers started costing the church big money, THEN the bishops acted.   Claims they """"didn't know"""" fall apart when  you look at all of the efforts to """"rehab"""" these guys...  The question was and remains: what moral obligations do bishops have in all of this?  I think its clear that personal accountability does NOT come into this mix for bishops.  It's also clear that children/victims, at least until recently, fall pretty low on the list too...

Vietnam exports much to the USA compared to other improverished nearby countries because Americans can afford the products. Not so much in Cambodia or Laos.  As Jimmy Carter pointed out when he spoke to the Cuban people onTV, the embargo has had a negative impact on Cuba, but Cuba had full trade relations with some 150 countries, including most of the EEU, Japan,China, etc. He pointed out that the same boshevik economic model that ruined the economies of the entire Soviet Bloc were in place in Cuba. The main thing the US embargo did was give Fidel a fig leaf to cover his regime and its command economy. . Remember in the early 60s....Castro decided...against all logic...to try and take over the world sugar market.  He didnt. The price of sugar fell, the Cuban economy collapsed, nothing on the store shelves by 1964. Cuba had to get the Soviet Bloc to bail them out.

Well, until you run out of batteries anyway, but hopefully by then you've oriented yourself. In fact, you could turn it off once you have your coords, then the batteries would last for weeks. And there's no need to get snarky just because you're convinced you're right.

0,"Big corporations do not have any right to tailor the public regulatory regime to favour their agenda or profitability. That is what the issue is about. The internet is a public utility, although this again appears to be under threat in the US because large corporate interests are seeking incremental advantages that will increase the value of what they offer and lower competitors value profile. This allows them to grow faster and constrains growth of  their competition which is not bad until they are the only game in town. Just because some interpret Natural Law as """"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer"""" does not make such policies the best things for building a fair and equitable modern world.

0,"I'd like to address your """"something for nothing"""" comment about the dividend payment.  A government handout as some describe it.  Alaska owns all the subsurface rights on state AND private land, with few exceptions, such as Alaskan Native lands and some pre-ANSCA private claims.  In most states the land owner owns the subsurface rights.  Oil, gas, gold or any other valuable commodity.  The dividend payment is a small equalizer for Alaskans who forfeit any ownership of subsurface minerals.   Otherwise, the profits go to either the state or to wealthy investors, such as in the oil tax credits under the disastrous SB 21 rule.  By taking half the dividend the governor applies a negative impact to the poorest Alaskans.  Plain and simple.  The well off Alaskan still gets a payment, or I guess a handout as some would define it.  No Dermot, I'll continue to oppose taxing poor Alaskan children and families while rewarding corporations.

0,"There are two opposing arguments here. Processors need many workers for relatively short periods of time. They pay $10 per hour regular time. They previously met all their hiring needs when they were able to hire as many foreign workers as needed. Their business model depended on hiring foreign workers (now available on a much reduced basis), ostensibly because Americans don't want these jobs. Due to labor shortages this year, they've been unable to process all the fish being caught, or which could have been caught. This has hurt the fishermen too.  On the flip side is the argument that if the processing companies paid a much higher wage, then Americans would flood in to fill their employment needs. Economists and politicians (with the mantra of """"protect American workers"""") can argue but not answer the competing theories. Time for a few major brave employers to experiment. Next season, offer higher pay and see if you can meet your hiring (and bottom line) needs with Americans.

I can envision coming together in small, home-based gatherings for intimate community and faith-sharing, and occasionally gathering for larger experiences of 'Church Universal.' My hope, though, is that the Catholic model of the megachurch (if that's where we're headed) doesn't just ape the current Evangelical model where the emphasis seems to be on performance rather than worship.  There is something distinctive about the Catholic sacramental experience that doesn't easily fit the megachurch model.

In 1985, when we had the first crash (remember?), I spoke with a couple of economists at the department of revenue when in Juneau. I'd been researching the world energy markets and how our state figured in. These people directed me to readings that proved prophetic: one of the conclusions of that research was that as it related to the year 1985, the net present value of Alaskan oil in 2050 was -0-.  We knew then we would be where we are now, short wisdom. Little emerged. We rejected that.  Clearly, we can restructure taxes that will gain more revenue from oil in the short run: that said, we must become wiser and more efficient in the services that we old time Alaskans still value. remember when we used to demand on each other? When we used to cooperate? Both parties will need to give up things they cherish in order to make this thing work. I'm willing.

Trump's success has been largely due to an alarmingly intense tide of rabid white nationalism that is sweeping large parts of the mainland. Put that all together and I dont think it's an exaggeration to say we're approaching Kristallnacht territory with Trump. Lets please at least keep that ugliness out of Hawaii.

The significance of Manafort to Mueller's investigation is that here we have a guy who helped a Russian-connected Ukrainian President to get elected. Manafort and Gates have connections to Russia and both end up on Trump's campaign team until Manafort got caught out. Donald Trump Jr and others have stated how much of the Trump empire's financing comes from Russia. Now we have the Russian-connected campaign team members for the Russian-financed Presidential candidate and we have Russians in possession of emails embarrassing to Hillary Clinton. It doesn't sound like Manafort and the Russians did the Democrats any great favours! So, do you think Dubya was being influenced by the Russians, he was still in power in 2006?

0,"that is an old concept of thinking of economic growth. Consumer spending is fine, but the expectations of growth on that are just not realistic and sustainable. There is to many parties in our economy which have no added value, aka middlemen etc. Housing is one of them, no reason why just to build a house is over 200 CAD per sqft, due to lack of many inefficiencies and greed. In Sweden with higher wages they build for about 100 CAD per sqft. The point being, our economic model and costs are just not sustainable. You bring in to the equation where immigrants are coming from. That is irrelevant, it is about how much the environment, economy in the broadest sense of the word. can bear without losing its sustainability short and long term. Most countries from Asia, Africa, Europe etc. are struggling with this as we all know. Population growth, consumption etc. versus what the earth can bear, the financials can bear etc. is just completely out of wack.

However, this hit the papers as a classic case of misogyny and that our justice system was severely flawed. Or my favourite. Remember how the Donald Trump voter was described? A redneck, whitetrash, male, trailer park resident. When in fact 42% of women voted for him, 29 % of Latino's and the majority of income earners in the top 3 income brackets.

Pretty good for a home.  I can then play guitar on the corner for weed and food money and live a stress free life.  I would be really curious to see if they can quantify the benefit of this later, or if they are going to hide.  I am pretty sure that this will exacerbate the situation and the homeless numbers will increase, but I could be wrong and this could be the answer.

And the incident, as described, would be a misdemeanor and not a felony.  Kevin Spacey is neither denying nor admitting the incident happened. He is simply saying he can't recall it. And he apologized, which is about all he can do.  Rapp has said he consulted a lawyer who advised him there was no case worth pursuing. I don't know if Rapp tried contacting Spacey before going public. I am not sure what he wants to have happen now.

As an accountant, and one who donates some of my time, experience, and alleged talents to the Church, I can tell you much more than """"25%"""" is dedicated to the endeavors I mentioned above...much more.  Perhaps your NGO is different.  I can't speak to that.  It would be nice if you also explain that Catholic Charities administers many programs the govt is involved in and supports - and to those programs, tax dollars are given...that Catholic Charities, since the Johnson admin, has been """"contracted"""" with by many govt agencies to administer what they themselves apparently cannot do as well.   That the money received is not for priests and religious, but for relief and assistance efforts.  Perhaps your NGO is different.  Now - when I say Catholic Charities above, I did not mean simply the umbrella org - but the charities that the Church supports that are not government affiliated.  You do know about those, right?

0,"It's a charming idea, but the sheer cost of drilling a 400 miles of tunnel would bankrupt the state budget. To make something like this profitable, you'd have to move tens of thousands of people per day.  And ... you still have the problem of moving those tens of thousands TO the tunnel entry point and FROM the delivery point, neither of which is likely to be their final destination.  Kind of like standing in a long line for a short ride on the Tomorrowland Rocketship.  I wish these entrepreneurs luck, but I'd be happy just to see proven, effective, high-speed rail established between Fort Collins-Denver-Colo Springs.  That wouldn't be cheap, either ... but it will be at least a factor of twenty cheaper than this ridiculous scheme.  And somehow they manage to make it work in China, France, Japan, Germany.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But then the 1935 skeptics of flying cars by the year 2000 may have had their heads screwed on right, also.

No cat doors, letting the cat out to roam free, etc. same with dogs or any domestic animal for that matter. If you agree to take responsibility for them that obliges you to keep them safe.  By the way, indoor cats that have been abandoned by their owners are not feral. They have been thrown out into a hostile world they are ill-equipped to handle.  If you don't want to feed them don't.

How can one disassociate the university/lab from the discovery? He not only needed tools and infrastructure, but also additional academic help.  2) Genome editing is the future of therapeutics. There are some proteins that are simply too damaged to be fixed by small molecules. Function can only be recovered or impeded to a certain degree in these structurally flawed proteins. Cutting out the genes and replacing with appropriate alternatives will be our next-gen tools. Whether CRISPR has the specificity to achieve this is uncertain, but it is a major advancement (or hot discovery).  3) Drug companies, bingo.

0,"Obama promised to not increase income taxes on individuals making $200,000 and joint filers making $250,000. Because of the great recession, he extended all tax cuts two years and then negotiated a deal which made the increases under that limit permanent, with the others expiring (he should have promised a lower threshhold IMO, they could have afforded a 3% marginal tax rate increase on their highest bracket). The sequester and budget caps that were enacted to pay for making those cuts permanent, as were the budget savings and tax inceases enacted within Obamacare (including steering student loans to the government, allowing those loans to be an asset and that income a source of income). The Trump budget and health care reforms all seek to undue this deal and go to high deficits to justify entitlement cuts on the poor and probably the elderly.

The only tax that was raised was the raise mandated by congress and signed by Carter about SS and it was put into effect earlier than  mandated by law.

Bush average over 8 years, 7.38%. Clinton average over 8 years, 8.57%. Obama average over 8 years, 8.71%. Now percentage increase by which party controlled the house and by president. Reagan/democrats - 14.13% over all 8 years. Clinton/democrats - 1993, 1994 - 7.45%. Clinton/republicans - 1995 to 2000 - 3.23%. Bush/republicans - 2001 to 2006 - 6.98%, Bush/democrats - 2007, 2008 - 8.6%. Obama/democrats - 2009, 2010 - 16.35%, Obama/republicans - 2011 to 2016 - 6.16%.

0,"Some interesting comments regarding RRSPs and TFSAs. To add some personal data to the mix, I have been in RRSP/RRIFs since day one and have been a limited contributor because I have a pension. In the early days, you had few self investor options and I went with RBCs Dividend fund which had a MER of 1.7%. Later, when you could self direct your RRSP contribution, I stayed with the dividend fund and swallowed the MER. Colour me stupid, I know, but age becomes a stick-in-the-mud factor.  However, when I retired in 1993, with a unindexed pension, I could afford more risk and went all in with blue chip, high dividend Cdn equity stocks, buy and hold. My portfolio of 9 stocks grew at a cash flow rate of 11% to date. Divs were reinvested in my own stock selection.  By comparison, my RRSP/RRIF program has returned a cash flow rate of return of 6% after the MER was extracted. My RRIF withdrawal is reinvested in my current stock portfolio. My income today far exceeds my earning income. No OAS.

When Harper's legislative agenda and executive reach clashed with the constitution - which it did frequently - the Supreme Court of Canada was there to knock him back.

Harper was infuriated - so much so he publicly assailed Chief Justice Beverly MacLachlin thereby undermining the credibility and independence of Canada's judiciary.  Already short a justice due to Republican obstructionism, the U.S. Supreme Court is about to be laden with one of its heaviest workloads in history. .

The CBO on Obamacare was very different because it showed positive impact on deficit since Obamacare paid for itself with taxes. It is expected that the ACA will still have more people covered than the new GOP plan. Costs will result in higher taxes at the State level. I am reading a summary of the new GOP plan which I got from a Republican Congressman's office. They just emailed me that a new version is coming because of mistakes. You should read it later today. For us in Hawaii, the most important thing is that Congress keep the tax credit for employers and other provisions that allow for employer provided plans at a group  discount. Or we in Hawaii have to get new policies on the open market at higher cost. I am told that the the Senate wants to protect this provision for employers but the House wanted to cut it.

0,"Over the past 40 years Canada has lost close to half a million high paying manufacturing jobs to China. Those jobs have been replaced by part time jobs in the service sector.  Every step of the way successive governments going back to PET have deepened this relationship selling it to Canadians as being good for jobs and good for the economy.  The Harper Government was no less guilty. Canada bled close to 180,000 high paying manufacturing jobs during his tenure.  History has proven without a doubt that trade with China has decimated our middle class, especially that area of the middle class with its foundation in the manufacturing sector.  There is no question that we will see Trudeau rubber stamp free trade with China. It is a done deal. It has been bought and paid for by corrupt communist Party influencers in bed with the LPC.

0,"Actually if Trump were an economic nationalist he would reject the idea of free trade and globalization and engage more in anti-mainstream measures like fair trade, trade protectionism, tariffs, and massive structural reforms using government. Even the right wing to far-right just like the left wing and far-left can be protectionist without going into National Socialism or Socialism or Communist on the far-left. People have to understand that prior to Reagan protectionism and the mixed economy was the mainstay of capitalism.  Also, Trump is not proposing using a state bank to pay for infrastructure. He is using P3s which are massively private and could lead to tolls, and is not effectively using the levers of government to have a very low cost for the infrastructure or even the avenues of taxation, and like I said he is not using an infrastructure bank to be used as a way of getting key priorities or infrastructure done.  He has shown that he is corporate-minded.

The point is that issues of justice between generations need to be looked at over life spans, with people paying a lot more than they receive for long stretches of their lives and receiving more than they pay at other times. And some generations may pay, financially and otherwise,  more than others---the war generation, for example, or even those in their prime earning years between 1990 and 2000,  faced with super taxes, including taxes on taxes,  and drastic cuts to services and  benefits, to bring federal finances under control. That, I would argue,  is just the burden of citizenship, together with  supporting some who always receive more than they pay. What you miss in the article is that the elderly gentleman in question most likely never worked or paid taxes here--he speaks only Greek.

0,"The liberal always claims that anyone who is against a particular idea for the moment is mindlessly against it always and in all forms. The deal is, we have a $2.5 billion deficit. No tax on our population will fix that. So somewhere, somehow cuts have to be made. Yet some of our legislators swear that no ore cuts are possible. This creates a conundrum. We can not solve our fiscal problem with a  tax or any cuts or any combination. Most who are against the tax believe, and I am one of them, that no tax should be instituted as long as fixing the balance of the deficit is unattainable. IF they cut until a reasonable tax of some sort would balance the books they might get a much warmer response. But as long as taking $600 million out if the private economy still leaves a $1.9 billion deficit it is pointless.

There were reasons that slavery (or, more accurately, the expansion of slavery into the territories) was such a dominant issue, and the moral case against slavery was not the most important driver of opposition to that expansion. Most people in the US - I suspect most Catholics, for that matter - don't regard abortion as the defining moral issue of our time.

Still, the fractured nature of political parties in the Netherlands (there are 20 on the ballot, and none gets more than about 20% support) means that governing is very difficult, and only the safest policies are adopted, because they need to be approved by the four or five parties of the coalition. In the Canadian system, there are huge waves from election to election, and the winning party has a mandate for four years. This party can actually do whatever it wants- it only has to answer to the people after that time. An individual vote means less, but collectively it means more. As it should; ours is a better system imho.

0,"Monica, insightful as usual. Some folks say that without access to priests salvation is impossible, since only priests have access to God and can get folks to heaven. IMHO this is bizarre to say the least. I know a lot of folks who are much closer to Christ and more Christ-like than I am. If access to priests is such a requirement, then a lot of good folks don't have a chance.  This does not seem much like the Jesus of the gospels.  Pope Francis has spoken out against clericalism, and he said sometimes it is the people themselves, not just priests, who will not let go of it. While we might need some form of priests, in the sense of leading in prayer, etc, we do not need the clerical caste. Many small groups choose their prayer leaders themselves in different ways, and it seems to work well.  IMHO the basic question is what does it mean for me/us in my/our particular circumstances to be a disciple of Christ.  This is a good question always, but especially these days.

They become private and then get heavily cut over.  The cut over state of Oregon's industrial forests, much of it acquired through fraud, rail road schemes, and phony land grants, suggest that the federal government should retake control. Under the Feds, these forests would again mature. Denuded watercourses would regain their cover, clarity and fisheries and the wildlife would gradually return.  The beautiful and productive 60,000 acre forest within Fort Lewis, Washington was a heavily cut industrial forest before the Feds recovered it and nursed it back into a valuable mature forest.

The current pause with Obamacare is just a pause, it may be another election or even a decade before more progress towards a single payer system is made, but it will happen eventually because it promises the irresistible outcome of high priced care for no cost.  Since we can't stop it,  we should embrace single payer premium health care for everyone.  This should even become the great American challenge, much like putting a man on the moon.  We can rebuild our economy around providing exemplary comprehensive health care for everyone, free to all residents, and for a reasonable fee for everyone else in the world.  Health care could easily become  40-50% of our GDP, and the principal focus of our economy.  It is highly resistant to recession, and it provides a compelling service especially in matters of life and death and it could provide full employment for everyone.

0,"You haven't a clue, which is patently obvious. Rural residents pay property taxes and provincial and federal taxes like everyone else. Yes I know urban people figure that they should get everything, but rural people pay and get a fraction of the services that urbans do. The roads in rural areas were paid for by taxes federal provincial and municipal, long before amalgamation with the cities. Natural gas pipelines pass through rural areas before it ever hits urban areas. Hydro lines pass through rural areas long before it ever hits urban areas and is buried. Hydro is often generated in those same rural areas, wind , water, and solar. Thanks, I'm glad we could help you urban folk with the necessities of life. By the way with respect to phone lines, extra billing for rurals, and you have heard of cell phones , haven't you. Hydro delivery charge for rurals is twice and then some, when compared to urbans.  Try to at least learn something, instead of living in some urban fantasy.

0,"As an aside: Despite what some may think, the Military has many in the ranks like James Gillcrist. Our son being one of them, they may keep low profiles, but they are there, as my wife says: “We need people with a conscience in the Military.”  They serve as a counter force to the “door kickers” and “wild eyed trigger pullers.”  Too often people get lumped into a basket and ignored or marginalized.  If people with a sound Catholic conscience or similar, left the Military, the US would be in a world of hurt. GW Bush proved with rampant bullying, we can antagonize the whole world and leave ourselves open to attacks against people living here. Asymmetrical warfare, was originate because of overbearing military might.  I applaud James Gillcrist, for his work, but we need to remember those who stay behind trying to accomplish the same.

The rites for the liturgy and sacraments were changed to emphasize their connection to Christ as revealed in Scripture and through our traditions. Retreating back into our castles and condemning other people had proved disastrous for Pius IX and his successors. Europe was in flames and then in ruins. The exodus from the Church started then, with liberalism, communism, and other movements pulling people away from their home in the Church. The Church was still identified with the old order, with the disorder of war, so many left. It was not liturgical changes, there were underlying social forces that pushed people away.

Fascism opposes liberalism, Marxism and anarchism and is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional left–right spectrum.[3][4]

0,"Dear Readers/Senator Lynn Beyak, i worked with two law firms herein Saskatchewan. i also attended a residential school for 10 years. Now, i am not sure if getting angry about your comments warrants abusive and/or threatening words but maybe, just maybe, i can share this with you all..  i do not mean to offend anyone but in a nutshell; i witnessed several stories from Elders about how they were mistreated/abused/tortured. Many are still scared to live their life, or, to speak out for fear of government officials. Many are stuck psychologically in this mindset. To make matters worse, this IAP process has made millionaires out of the lawyers/adjudicators. This is why the cycle of abuse is rampant among the communities. Suicide is one way of dealing with it. Hence the high numbers that we read/hear about. In the 70's my community had the highest suicide rate in Canada for 2 years. I was abused in the schools you talk about. i would like to share that with you, in a good meaningful way.

We know this because average income and average housing prices are completely disengaged from one another. The basic human need of shelter being sold off on the global market An entire generation of Canadians locked out and displaced from their families and the areas they were born and raised in.

We have been systematically dismantling it for 40 years now, to the point where it all runs solely on credit.

That is mostly reserved for the elites of government, public employees, and a few in the private sector (union or senior management types).  Its not sustainable.

Firearm ownership has an extremely small likelihood any particular firearm will ever kill anyone; their actual major purpose by an enormous margin is as a deterrent to violence.  Please look up the number of homicides and accidents related to firearms per year compared to the number of deaths by abortion per year (about 98% for convenience rather than serious medical reasons, rape or incest), then explain to us exactly who is confused and why.

0,"You accept that Jesus preached the reign of God.  And, of course, taking Jesus literally is not necessarily alien to that.  But, I would suggest that taking Jesus seriously is more important than taking him literally.  You treat as a simple command a teaching on marriage that is much more powerful, and much more connected to the primary thrust of Christ's teaching, than you are willing to recognize.  """"God doesn't give us inconsistent commandments.""""  True.  But that's not the question.  The problem is not God, it's us.  Human interpretations can and do embarrass the church by making God appear inconsistent, as St. Augustine appreciated when he cautioned against interpreting God's Book of Scripture contrary to God's Book of Nature.  Finally, your history is mistaken.  Indissolubility has never been the simple rule that you prefer.  Consider Paul's handling of the pagan couple, one of whom converted.

There have been far worse candidates than Hillary Clinton, but Trump is the worst of them all.  Every charge against Hillary made by Trump and his supporters appear to have been sheer projection.

That’s the excuse Kitty Piercy and her hand-picked West Eugene Collaborative group have used, which will result in running 80 EmX trips-per-day in the existing traffic lanes, in mixed traffic, on West 11th Avenue (from Garfield to Bailey Hill Rd, 1 mile).  The city is using congestion to hinder traffic flow, with the goal of forcing more people to walk, ride a bicycle, or transit. So, they really don’t care about congestion other than to use it to force their agenda.  Here’s an illuminating read about the flawed West Eugene Parkway, and how the WEC “did not include any West Eugene neighborhood groups until after a year of public criticism about the exclusions.” (The same type of exclusion was tried during the so called “process” of the SW-SAZ, but finally failed.)  http://www.sustaineugene.org/wec.html

United management needed to get a flight crew across the country quickly, and didn't see any problem with bumping paying customers who were already boarded, and, in the end, relying on force to accomplish that goal. How much was it worth to United, financially, to get that crew to its destination? The airline should have been willing to pay that price by bidding up the cost of seats on that flight until passengers volunteered (really volunteered, as opposed to being dragged from the plane) to leave. Essentially, in the end, United resorted to thuggery--and violated regulations on denying passage to passengers who are already boarded--in order to save a few dollars. Putting profit ahead of the health and welfare of passengers is the real problem here, not overbooking.

In a world older and more complete than ours they move finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear.

I would like to add that corporations can invest their after tax income, either by expanding, which is good for the local economy and creates jobs, pay dividends to the owners (perish the thought) who pay income tax on the dividends, and get more dividends if there is more after tax income, and the consumer benefits through lower prices as the corporation otherwise has to include the tax costs in their pricing. And then there is the fact that government does not create jobs by robbing Peter to pay Paul, and if businesses do not prosper, neither do the citizens. The government role is to create conditions for economic growth, and high corporate taxes are a great idea for Liberals who know that budgets take care of themselves and any amount of borrowing to divide and conquer the electorate is a no lose proposition. For Liberals with good hair especially. Shareholders are subject to double taxation when corporation taxes are factored in. Once is enough.

0,"In theory I agree with you, but globalization and the decline of organized labor has been devastating for the working class. Obama's vision was for government to invest in new industries that would create new kinds of jobs that could not be exported overseas, but that is a long-term initiative and as we know Obama met with a great deal of obstructionism for purely political purposes.  Trump promised easy panaceas because he is massively ignorant. Remember when he was going to get rid of NAFTA? You don't hear his apologists breathe a word about dialing back that flashy vow. Trump has withdrawn the US from the TPP, which obviously a lot of lefties opposed as well, but as problematic at the TPP is, I think that was a mistake. Trump relinquished US power to determine trade relations in the Pacific. A huge concession.

0,"Ann, I am not sure exactly what you mean by saying women have a lower accountability threshold. Women that get pregnant are held accountable for having unprotected sex. Women who carry a baby to full term are held accountable for the safety and health care of the baby even if there is a father in the picture. Society holds women accountable for being raped by saying the woman should not have been dressed the way she was or that she should not have been out late at night walking alone. Sometimes they say the woman deserved what she got because she was incapacitated. Women who are beaten are held accountable too. By society and by the system. She should just """"leave"""" him. She should keep her mouth shut. Be a """"good"""" wife. Women are held accountable for being single parents by society and the system. It comes in the form of lower wages, lack of affordable housing and lack of safe childcare. Yes, women in Alaska have strong survival instincts, they have to.

0,"I am used to moving on after a disappointing election. Living in Vermont, I usually vote democratic, but since in such a small state we get to know candidates, sometimes I (we) vote for the republican. But republicans here are republicans: balanced budgets and spending, eliminating inane regulations. But this time is different. I could quickly accept Reagan, Bush I, even Bush II and Nixon -- because I then felt they were basically good people. But with Donald, I feel uncertain, not knowing what the barrages of tweets might mean, what agenda if any is at work, fearing that DT wants actually to hurt people. Sometimes I think President Trump is like the uncle Donny who graces every family, who says mean-spirited things, and whom the rest of the family ignores: """"It's just Uncle Donny.""""

As for Barnard’s statement that “Black people should stop saying we [white people] are to blame for their problems”, he clearly hasn't heard of that little thing that impacted on this country for 400 years, called Apartheid. (though perhaps he's too busy putting new marks in his 'asshole' column to pay much attention to history).

Loss of federal jurisdiction on equal protection (a major pro-life goal) is abhorrent and unAmerican.

Incidentally, the Bakken extends into South Dakota where it is called the Red River play.  Fracking may be an old idea but not until the second decade of the 21st century did it come into wide use, combined with horizontal drilling. Both techniques have evolved resulting in higher productivity and lower costs, but companies that only drill, and that need to keep drilling to maintain profits, are struggling when prices go below $50/bbl. There are tremendous unexploited reserves in the US and worldwide, but until Saudi oil production slows, those resources will remain untouched.

There are merits to this in academia, although it remains problematic in various ways, but few carry-over to the policy domain. 2. I'm puzzled here. The main thrust of the article seems to be that Malikane is a 'bogus economist' based on your assessment of his credentials. By implication, you and those you professionally associate with are not? That's different to the point about not accepting arguments based merely on credentials (which I agree with). 3. I'd argue that the question is misplaced: no unique, alternative and objective measure exists. It requires some level of judgement across a variety of dimensions.  Peer review is a deeply-flawed option (see also my reply to Stuart, above).  Regards, Sean
"
1,"Sorry but, how does the former BC Liberal gov't get credit for this? 1. The Liberals prioritized Corporate interests, while it's common knowledge that small businesses are the real economic driver. 2. Governments are not the be all and end all of economic activity.  """"Liberal-generated surplus""""?  Let's drop that illusion. 3. The Liberals prided themselves as """"the people in the business suits"""", yet were way off in their forecast.  How does this qualify them as having been competent managers - especially as the pronounced miss was on the 'positive' side? 4. A surplus pales when racking up all-time-high debt, and seeing highest poverty levels in Canada. Liberal pundits are guilty of 'heads I win, tails you lose' logic here.  If the economy 'grows', that's the former government's credit.  If it doesn't, that's the NDP's fault.  No matter WHAT the NDP now do, they will fail based on this logic.  Ridiculous.

No matter what tax monies at being collected we run deficits and - more concerning - accumulate debt ( e.g. Ontariowe at >$300B ). And never mind the federal marginal rate in excess of 50% - add the provincial, municipal, HST, PST, various other fiddles .... and the effective rate becomes confiscatory in the higher tax brackets.

0,"A little alarmed that this advice doesn't mention the need to address the Revenue Canada implications of changing a primary residence in use from personal-use to income-producing.  When the property use changes from personal-use to income-producing , the deemed disposition can result in a capital gain. You're essentially considered to have sold the property to yourself when the use changed, and your capital gain on that sale is taxed.  Any gain resulting from this deemed disposition may be eliminated by the principal residence exemption (PRE) if the property has always been the taxpayer's principal residence. The taxpayer may also defer recognition of the resulting capital gain (if any) by electing under subsection 45(2) of the Income Tax Act to be deemed not to have made the change in use.  This defers the recognition of the capital gain until the property is ultimately sold.

It is rooted in the completely unprecedented entrusting of the country's future to a man not merely not qualified for his office, but of abundantly and repeatedly demonstrated unfitness for it.  It is, if you want, first and foremost a character issue.  Anybody's character is debatable at the margins; everybody in public life has cut some corners.  But that is not what we face here.  We face a man who has repeatedly shown an inability to deal with palpable, provable facts if he deems them inconvenient.  A man who has lied repeatedly--and learned he can get away with it.  A demagogue who has learned that nearly half the country will accept his blowing up minor issues into pivots on which truly major policy questions are then made to turn.  It is precisely the success that Trump has had with his mendacious ways that makes the threat so grave.

0,"I support further budget cuts across the board. I stand opposed to an income tax of any kind no matter how small it may start. They all start small. The income tax is favored by socialist leaning people. Politicians buy votes under an income tax by promising government benefits the other guy pays for. They redistribute the earnings of one group of people & distribute it to another group of people who have not earned it through government programs of various kinds. The income tax invades privacy & private property rights. The income tax system can put people in jail. That kind of tax system is incompatible in a free society. Marx & Engles favored an income tax in their “Communist Manifesto”. Our Founding Fathers made it unconstitutional. They favored consumption taxes which are less detrimental to liberty & freedom. A sales tax is a consumption tax. I would support a sales tax. https://nccs.net/1996-03-answers-to-americas-tax-problems

Daily they are working to plug up the dyke, but as we all know, often the flow of need is a hundred times the resources. Poor people need a union, and they need to find a way to apply for state and federal funds. The state offered quite a bit for homelessness solutions, and it went to the poverty board, but I expect going forward that a really powerful poor and homeless union would find a way to get funding from a variety of sources.

But if vote-rigging is confined to one or two of 338 ridings and campaign workers and there is no evidence implicating the candidate, I would not cut him or her loose.  Keeping candidates responsible for everything that happens in their campaigns is these days about as feasible as expecting ministers to resign every time something amiss occurs in their departments.  These days they almost never resign except in the most egregious instances.  And while I think that the shelving of this responsibility principle has gone too far, I also think each case must be carefully considered on its particulars.  If it is reasonable to believe the candidate or minister did and would not be expected to know and did not encourage such conduct they should remain in place.  My one year minimum rule for candidates and members would help, I think.

Nature is one hundreds of million year-long PARADE of extinction that stretches from before trilobites down to the present day.  Sustained eradication campaigns against feral cats are particularly effective on islands.  The Island Conservation and Ecology Group, Instituto de Ecologia del Universidad Autonoma de Mexico, Centro de Investigationes de Biologias de Noroeste and offices of the Areas Naturales Protegidas in 1994 helped local folks eradicate feral cats from 26 islands off the northwest Mexican coast. In five years they'd succeeded on 16 of them. Twenty-six endemic reptile, 21 endemic mammal and one endemic bird species recovered once the cats were gone.  For two other endemic birds it was too late — they're extinct.

Hawai'i has ALWAYS been a sanctuary for humanity from the first time, thousands of years ago, that our Polynesian kupuna set foot in Hawai'i to establish the nation of Hawai'i until today.  There has in fact been only one time in our recent history that Hawai'i has rejected the presence in our islands of anyone. That was when the US military invaded our kingdom to support a small group of 30 or so white supremacist rebel traitors to depose our beloved queen and take control of our government under threat of force, an illegal coup d'etat.  124 years later the US government and its military still unlawfully occupy our kingdom. Thankfully though we are making great strides, in the arena of international diplomacy, to finally and unconditionally bring an end to the unlawful US occupation of Hawai'i so that we can once more welcome all to the Kingdom of Hawai'i with aloha.

Most of what you propose is more draconian than the other practical matter that actually does affect even more number of citizens.  Cars/trucks can even be rented.  You also propose citizens policing each other by checking cards which I believe wrong.  Carrying papers to enforce an enumerated right is a very slippery slope.  Actually, my driving and that of others as a threat is truly intentional.  We all know the risks when we go motoring. Everyone else is counting on my condition to range somewhere in between medical emergency and pure evil as I drive.  I count on them for the same.  I have to trust, but avoid them.

Embryos carry their own unique human DNA, and are following the early part of the same human life cycle that all humans do. If they were not persons, there would be no reason to abort them. It is precisely because they are persons that they are aborted. To call them not persons is an arbitrary decision of convenience made by people willing to exercise their own power over the most vulnerable in order to violently cut short their life cycle.

There are medical varieties of pot for treatment purposes which have zero hallucinogenic effect, but he won't limit pot use to just that type, though he easily could. Trudeau ignores the scientific experts that he likes to boast he's committed to for guidance. Right.

Islamization set in motion a process of gradual decline for Christianity in northern Sudan, culminating in the overthrow of the Christian kingdoms in 1504 by an alliance of Arabs and the Muslim kingdom of Funj.

Tough to get a true figure on what First Nations annual costs are for tax-payers, but based upon findings from some who've spent much more time than I in attempting to discover the magic number, it's likely around $10 billion a year.  Yeah: BILLION, when all programs, special assistance aid and other items are added in.  So, that is still way, way more than the cost for a one-shot 30,000 Syrian refugee influx, and a whole lot more than the 3 Billion we provided in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and Syria over a 5-year period.

My husband and I were civil-unionized in Vermont in 2000, and married by the province of Québec in 2005; and while we don't actually require a church wedding, nevertheless we consider our marriage a sacramental one, and take seriously the church's traditional aspirations for the relationship between married partners.

But that's the despot's way, isn't it? People are promised freedom and delivered oppression, with just enough 'haves' at the top of the food chain to keep the 'have nots' under heel. A lesson for our times? Perhaps.  Now, on the topic of novels adapted into television series, I've grown cautious. I've see too many become bloated and drag on to accommodate the episodic multi-season format. (The current Amazon version of 'The Man in the High Castle' comes to mind.) Before I commit to a series, I want to know that the producers have a clear endgame in mind and -- just as important -- a disciplined timeline. If I read that a series may last three seasons or ten depending on popularity, that's a definite red flag.

It was so sad to watch David Guttenberg badmouthing certain people who were filing for office on the one hand, while holding the hand of a Democratic placeholder candidate through every single step of the filing process on the other hand.  There's been a lot of that within the ADP in recent times.  Notice that the Democratic placeholder sacrificial lamb running against Tammie Wilson only pulled 7 percent this time out?  Against Wilson, the Dems pulled 22.6% in 2010 and 20.3% in 2014 in two-way races.

0,"And you go right ahead and help whoever you want to help. I will do likewise.  I am not saying it is the role of the Church to enforce immigration law.  Obviously Christians help whoever needs help, regardless of their immigration status. I am also not suggesting we call ICE when we help someone we know to be illegally here.  It does not follow that the government does not have the right to immigration law--as any other country has immigration laws.  It does not follow that the US has no right to border security, as other countries have that right also--as the Vatican has that right.  My point is that I am not going to call out the government for enforcing the laws of our nation.  We have the right to sovereign borders.  The government has the right to enforce immigration law.  There is nothing unjust, in principle about the notion that a sovereign nation has the right to regulate who is allowed in or who is allowed to stay.

0,"So many interesting comments on this article.  hats off to Charford,VIc E,Reality77, Argyle, Andrew, Skyofblue, realist, netnub..  I can pretty much go down the whole list.  Racism is a term so loosely  used it has lost it's true meaning.  The definition is :"""" prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior"""".   By the  very definition, this article is not talking about racism at all.  Pretty much any of the commenters on this could have done a better job, with a much clearer unbiased view on what are really culture clashes and socio-economic disparities.  Culture is not race, it's time we made that distinction, too.  personally, and based upon the people I know, many from varied backgrounds, I feel there is very little actual racism in western cultures.

That means everyone pays for their health coverage because even if you're young and healthy, accidents happen. If you're already sick, you need affordable care. Everyone pays in, because otherwise the uninsured lose all or they go to the emergency room and you and I pay for it.  Are premiums too high right now? Yes, so let's make changes to Obamacare to rein in premium costs.  As things stand, the ACA (Obamacare) has slowed the increase in health care costs while insuring a record number of Americans. Destroying it will send health care costs spiraling upward and cause 20-30 million people to lose access to care. Stupid!

0,"I don't know why this is such an issue for you.  Churches have been getting tax breaks or decades, with the stipulation they stay our of politics. Religious leaders and some members of Congress have been pushing to remove the wall between church and state.  Churches will benefit greatly from tax money routed to them through the voucher program.  Where do you think that money will come from?  Public schools will be impoverished and may close.  That may sound great to you; do you like the idea of ALL available schools being private?  I know some charter schools which will love it; the only reason they are constrained from teaching history as bible stories is the tax money they get now.
"
0,"The only purpose of a tax is to take money from one group of people in order to give it to another group of people because they are more 'deserving' in the judgment of those who designed the tax.  The GRT takes it away from everybody--including those it is supposed to benefit.  Your 'solution' would be to then give it back to the lowest income people that you took it away from by your ill-designed GRT tax in the first place.  I don't view that as """"a sensible tax structure"""".

However, I once directly employed close to 2,000 direct employees, along with over 800 subcontractors, in several manufacturing, and land development sectors.. I did a lot of interviews over a 40 year period.  PHD degrees in theoretical majors like sociology/ psychology, economics, or humanities majors to name a few,  are not of much use really.  Take history. I minored in history, and love the subject. But what can you do with a PHD in history other than teach history ? There are many other majors that universities have created to boost their bottom line. However, the student finds out very quickly they can't find a job in their major when they graduate. Now they are stuck with a student loan they can't repay.

To be fair, I believe it was approved something like 15 years ago and at that time no one was talking about LRT's, for whatever reason. But yes,  an LRT might have been a better choice.  However the Rob Ford Folly 1-Stop Subway extension is particularly egregious since it was originally designed to be an LRT which would have served a much wider area, would have been paid for entirely by the province and the city would have had money available to build the Eglinton E. LRT extension that would have extended transit into a lot wider area of Scarborough.  So there is quite a pile of 'facts' that had to be ignored in order to change this LRT into a subway.

Social conservatives are freaking out because they no longer control the moral and ethical paradigm in this country, they can no longer have the government harass and punish gay people because they feel gay people need to be punished and controlled. That's what this is really about. Social conservatives lashing out, wanting the government, through a SCOTUS ruling, to enforce the social conservatives' feeling of moral superiority. This isn't about artistic freedom. This is about social conservatives feeling the need to express power.

In Syria however, these ineffective attacks using a single bomb or missile is NOT how trained chemical weapons forces use chemical weapons. They have to be used massively and NBC protected troops have to be able to take the affected ground and decontaminate for the attack to be effective. A single bomb or missile used in an area that can't be immediately overrun and occupied isn't a professional chemical attack.....it's a false flag.

0,"Hypocrisy. It's a term used a lot to dismiss those whose words do not match their deeds. Or, for those that criticize one side when their own side does the same thing. Leaving aside the philosophical question of whether one can criticize hypocrites if one has ever been a hypocrite, what happens when we see someone who embodies the lifestyle they propose others follow? Void of the sin of hypocrisy, do we afford them acceptance and seek to adhere to at least some of what they preach? Jan Spencer has shown the community what can be done by doing it. He walks the talk. His goals to take no more from the earth than what the earth can provide is a lesson to us all. And since his is doing it, no one can claim he is a hypocrite. Now some may say we can't all live like Jan and they are right. But nearly anyone can do some of what Jan does.  But anything less, and we have fallen short of Jan's living by example. I am in this category.

0,"Iran may have a nominal democracy, but it is the theocrats who hold the real power, just as the Shōgun controlled feudal Japan through a figurehead Emperor. They do have legitimate reason to distrust the U.S., however; America goaded Iraq into attacking Iran shortly after the 1979 revolution, leading to the bloody Iran-Iraq War.  You only need to take a stroll around Tehran (yes, Westerners may visit) and view the political propaganda murals on the buildings to show you just how unemotionally the Iranian establishment views America. The Statue of Liberty made up to look like a skeleton with a Grim Reaper scythe is particularly evocative.  Moreover, Iran doesn't have the best record on human rights, and that is supposedly nectar and ambrosia to liberals. You know a Middle Eastern nation that does have both democracy and human rights? Israel. But just try to get liberals in general, or anyone at the U.N. in particular, to say anything good about Israel. They are such hypocrites.

That's hardly “historic” and the furthest thing from “massive.” This is a flat-out lie, even if you allow a little embellishment for the sake of a good story.

In my original post I listed several causes of preventable death in the US that account for hundreds of thousands of deaths every year which, I think, goes a long way towards highlighting the irrationality (and uselessness) of Drumpf's ban.

China will then cut off all aid to North Korea while the U.S. and South Korea impose a naval blockade of North Korea to prevent ships from entering or leaving North Korea.  It might take a year or two before North Korea collapses, but it is the only way to make it happen short of war without the outside aid North Korea now receives.

0,"The two biggest drivers of State spending are Health and Social Services and Education.   Since 2000, we've added 100k people to the State, including thousands of school age children.   When you bring jobs to the State you bring families, including children.   With our high cost per student for education, it follows that the education expense has increased.   The largest category of State expense is health and social services.   The elderly population in Alaska has increased from 35k to almost 70k since 2000.   Accordingly, the medicare and medicaid expenses have increased proportionally.  Although these expenses can be trimmed, they cannot be significantly cut.   This is why simply calling for spending cuts will be insufficient to close our budget gap.   It's also why there has to be broad based taxes (income and sales) to tie our spending to our population levels.

0,"It is important that we acknowledge that the attitudes and actions current during earlier eras differ than our own (and in some ways were deplorable by current standards): We do both ourselves & the past a serious disservice, however, if we allow valid criticisms of our earlier leaders to obscure the good they did.  While Sir John A reflected the racist attitudes common to his era, he did actively oppose the strident anti-Catholic & anti-French Canadian biases of the Orange Order & too many other Canadians of that period. He was instrumental in bringing moderate Irish & French speaking Catholics & moderate Protestants together to form Canada & work together politically (failing only during the Riel Hanging Crisis).  We should celebrate the achievements of the past while acknowleging its shortcomings.

0,"In the early years of the Church, Justin Martyr expressed the proper 'Christian' attitude  Justin First Apology - “Reason directs those who are truly pious and philosophical to honour and love only what is true, declining to follow traditional opinions, if these be worthless. For not only does sound reason direct us to refuse the guidance of those who did or taught anything wrong, but it is incumbent on the lover of truth, by all means – even if death be threatened, even before his own life – to choose to do and say what is right.”  This attitude should be the first of our “Traditional Doctrines” in the Church.  The Spirit can only 'reveal' the amount of 'truth' that humanity, individually and collectively, is able to comprehend at any given time. It's the rule expressed by St Paul – 'when I was a child, I thought as a child; when I grew, I learned to think as an adult'.  If we cannot grow in knowledge, we will never attain 'the fullness of truth' - there is always more to learn!

0,"I agree. To me, there are tiers of objectives and the first is if someone has a job that wants it. I don't think the tax-cutting approach Trump proposed has done well in that regard, at least in Kansas. The second is if the working class is getting an appropriate slice of the pie. As you say, wealth and growth in wealth in the past decades has gone primarily to the very rich. Trump's tax plan gives tax cuts to everyone, but to the richest most of all, so I don't see that helping either.  His desire to bring back manufacturing would help wages, perhaps, but I don't see that as realistic, unfortunately.

When Trump had the first call to answer a question he threw out his usual garbled word salad which Hillary ignored and actually answered the question in her time. When her turn she did the same. Both she and her team know the fact checkers will later dissect and trash anything he said. By keeping her composure she showed clearly who was the competent and informed adult and who played the unprofessional, uninformed child on the stage. His attempts on embarrassment went ignored including the women he foolishly pranced across the stage. Actually they gave a good rational for Bill keeping his marriage together. Trump will never be able to truly debate due to ignorance. Her meeting him again would make that very clear and allow his boorishness to be shown again in public and deprive him of accusing her of cowardice. She would put on display again her demeanor that shouts """"President."""" Proof after the last meeting...she was rated winner by 57%.

Of course, the predictable play call based on down and formation makes it 200% harder to block when the opponent seems to knows what is coming. Making things worse, the coaches have refused to mix things up and give the line any help from a tight ends, a back, or extra lineman. Play a weak team against the run and Broncos lineup in shotgun with tight ends split out or 3 wides. Game plan made know sense, lack of adjustments, and lack of new creative wrinkles was dumbfounding. Joseph said he was puzzled as it worked in practice and earlier in the year.

The Attorney General's own Notary Office also does not provide public information on Notaries who are accused of misconduct.

Certainly the advice that everyone should get the shot diverts monies from the health care system where it could be better spent.  Interestingly the Globe published an article a couple of months ago to discredit the use of vitamin d supplements to prevent the flu.  Given that the absolute benefit was 2%, not very different from that of the flu shot, you might conclude that the article was severely biased.

Thus, while a President has the Constitutional right to fire an FBI Director, he may, under certain circumstances, be obstructing justice in so doing. I'm not saying that this is or isn't the case here; just that this point is overlooked in this article. Also, what civil liberties are at risk for protecting the people from Presidents obstructing justice? None. It protects the integrity of the Democratic system and provides a slight disincentive to Presidents who might be inclined to give into such obstructionist behavior.

Sure, we may get a person allocated to our area or your area, but that person is not necessarily one of choice.

There has to be a better system to hold the daycare operators and those who are supposed to oversee them accountable. The DHS has to make substantial changes to their policies and someone has to also make the DHS accountable. My sister's and King's loss are not the only ones. There are others that have only come to dead-ends when trying to find answers. To what end should this continue before the government or someone does something?

0,"It is utterly inappropriate and evil to demand that someone over an arbitrary income give money when there are already state and federal mechanisms of funding and paying for disaster relief.  Democrat Gov Blanco and now-imprisoned Democrat mayor Ray Nagin did not ask for support and were not specific in the relief they asked for during Hurricane Katrina, and the Stafford Act Amendment was a direct result: Now if the local and state leadership don't ask for help in a timely manner, FEMA and the Federal government can and will intervene and take action- including financial support.  Your demand is an asinine one.

0,"It's interesting. Israel took over the West Bank land from Jordan during the Six-Day War in 1967. As late as 1988, Jordan said it didn't want the West Bank land back. Jordan still doesn't want it.  So who now owns the West Bank land? The Palestinians don't own the West Bank land. Why isn't anybody telling Palestinians they shouldn't build settlements on the West Bank land?  Over the years, the UN has made about 60 resolutions against Israel. To my knowledge, Israel hasn't followed any one of them. Israel will not likely abide by the recent UN resolution about settlements in the West Bank.  If the UN doesn't think Israel should build settlements on the West Bank land, why doesn't the UN organize soldiers from many countries to head into the West Bank to control that land?

As applying our own Constitution of THIS Nation, and its legal citizens, you hold unto the position, that one cannot imply an amorphous potential of threat, even, at the same time, many individuals residing within said Nations, present a concrete, overt threat, unto our Nation as an individual, or group?  How does a sovereign Nation, such as ours, determine which individual is simply an amorphous threat, and which individual is an overt threat?  We cannot, because as you state, we are not the 'thought' police, and thusly, should err upon the side of caution within regard unto these Nations that the Obama administration deemed the most dangerous unto our own Nation.  You would not allow a potential dangerous character into your own residence, say a possible gang member, without finding out more about them, would you, Foster McTeague?  Well, nor should this Nation allow such entrance, until said individual has been deemed safe, and worthy to do so.

The excuses I've seen for people not wanting a muslim cemetery are all irrational, ignorant, and fearful with no basis in reality.  It's unfortunate that you can't see the difference between those concepts and are instead caught up in some self induced echo chamber of being offended about people being called out for their prejudices.

0,"There was an army-issued gun in pretty much every home.   Nobody used them and nobody was very interested in them.   They had to be locked away and secured.  There were also a lot of fully-stocked bomb shelters -- a holdover from WWII and concerns about tanks coming over the mountains.   There was a bomb shelter on the property of the home where I lived.  There was a field across from my house there.   Every few months, the army guys would set up for a couple of weeks and do training with tanks and so on - fascinating stuff.    There was also air-raid siren testing on a tight schedule every three months.   All the air-raid horns would go off around the country in a relay that would run all day.  Creepy and reassuring at the same time.  And - the trains were never late.  All I can say is that the Swiss are some of the most careful, prepared and meticulous people I have ever come across, and were also scared out of their minds by WWII.   And, yes, they are very contented.

0,"The comment from AC that """"“miscommunication” occurred because the airline was not dealing directly with the family"""" gives only a small clue as to how this actually happened.  Who were they dealing with - a third party booking site?  Were all family members on one booking, or were they on several bookings?  Did the booking indicate that the 10 year old was in fact a minor, or was that information omitted?  Were they connecting to Costa Rica on AC or another airline?  Was the problem at OLCI that the son could not get a seat assignment, or that he could not check in at all?  The answers to all these questions are needed before it can be determined exactly what happened.  Splitting hairs maybe, but the son was never bumped per se - he likely could have obtained a boarding pass with GTE for seat assignment, and sorted it all out at the airport.  AC was certainly not responsive both before and after, but it is likely the bookings did not give a true picture of the actual party travelling.

0,"I believe that's called a """"right of way."""" Usually from road to 15 feet past say the power lines. While it's still technically the owners property, the state/associated utilities can do what they want to it (within reason) that would be protecting the right of way. I personally think the utility companies along with the state should be covering the cost to put in this bolder reinforced trench. Course I also think the mat-su local, state, and or federal government should be attempting to protect the private property along the river, as it would be beneficial to all parties in the long run to permently fix this problem. Protected property = higher property values = stronger tax base. Protecting both infulstructure and private property = less federal loss claims ect. What is it 14 properties at around 300k a property, a little over 4.2 million in private property, a little over 1 million in power company, 2 mil in telecom, and 10 mil in roadway.

0,"Wayne Blank, CPA Most oil producing nations provide a production credit to the oil companies for extracting their oil. BP is paid $2 a barrel to extract Iraq's oil from its Ramadi field. Iraq then charges BP a tax on the sale of that oil which recoups the $2 credit and provides a comfortable revenue stream.  Alaska pays close to $50 a barrel for a production credit, so with oil below that level, we were paying them. They are now paying us, but not very much.  The argument is that Alaska is cold and remote, so companies need the incentive. Iraq is a war zone. I fail to see the difference. So, maybe to have a sweet pot, we don't low-ball them at $2 a barrel. Maybe set it at $5-10 a barrel. But make it a firm point. It doesn't go higher. That would be commonsense, which has absolutely nothing to do with Alaska oil tax schemes. I don't even know why we call it commonsense so it is so rare.

Imagine what being a Muslim must feel like. Look at this entire comment section. Just the mere mention of Muslims has people passionately inciting references to beheadings and extremism, as if all Muslims are akin to Islam's most extreme elements. I point out """"Most Muslims in the US are not like this."""" And I get diatribes about how bad some Muslims are, and being accused of endorsing or being dangerously complicit with those extremes.  My point is this: extra care should be taken to ensure peaceful law-abiding American citizens are not targeted by these demonstrations. If left unchecked there are consequences that erupt in the form of violent bigotry.  https://www.ted.com/talks/suzanne_barakat_islamophobia_killed_my_brother_let_s_end_the_hate

Even if this corruption charge does not go through due to Republican meddling, or Trump personally trying to kill the charges like he has been doing with other investigations looking into his misdeeds, he will always do more activities that will give cause for criminal proceedings.

Even through the legal routes of naturalization, immigration and naturalization costs taxpayers, and the states that many of this people reside in (CA, NY, FL, TX, NJ, etc), a lot of money to support them through federal and state programs.This issue is compounded by illegals who bring children and then birth children on U.S. soil claiming benefits such as food stamps, school lunch programs, health care, education vouchers, etc. This population of immigrants sucks resources from U.S. citizens, on the taxpayer's dime.

0,"Tim,  This article is about outside money influencing our elections.  Coghill's record is the perfect example of how outside money is used to hurt the interests of Alaskans.  VECO was the bag man for Big Oil.  VECO got lucrative no-bid contracts from Big Oil and the quid pro quo was that it would either bribe, wine, dine, and assist with campaigns of people like Coghill.  Coghill did not take bribes, but he took VECO campaign money, and their dinners.  The holy grail for Big Oil is the theft of Alaska oil- as is the case today- where billions of dollars of oil is taken, tax free.  Big Oil also enjoys one billion dollars in secret corporate welfare payments per year.  Coghill voted for SB-21.  He is responsible for this theft.  To enable the theft of Alaska's resources Big Oil (and other outside industries that do business here) use people like Coghill to implement all sorts of new taxes on Alaskans.  Hence the relevance of the examples cited.

Additionally, it is widely known that crime rates are out of control in the black community, with close to 50% of America's murders taking place entirely within that one community, despite it forming only 12% of the population.

Nope. The prices are climbing faster than you can save and, unlike the past when you could save up a larger down payment through sacrifice, the same strategy now puts you further behind each year.  Closer to retirement? Given the minor ducats most young people earn, this won't be the difference maker.  Absorbing the carrying cost of having a kid? As the article indicates, no way.

Personally, I actually wish Europe (especially Paris) adopted a tipping culture if only to create the incentive raise the level of service from a bare minimum, which I admit is typically pretty good but no higher than for here in the US, to result in less mundane if not deplorable experiences.  In other words, without tipping those service experiences are more likely to slide down than rise up.

Eric Norstad's conclusion to the facts: Mr. Sparhawk """"provoked the incident.""""  My conclusion: Any reasonable person would disagree with Eric Norstad's conclusion. Any reasonable person would also disagree when they see or hear the news media use language inferring Milo Yiannopoulis provoked the violent riots in Berkeley, or that Mr. Trump provoked any of the violence in the recent demonstrations, as if the demonstrators do not control their own choices and actions. Peaceful and lawful demonstrations are our right. Violence is not. Hold the right people responsible.

Did we seek his repatriation (as every other Western country did), and try to negotiate a settlement to the law suit then?  No.  We fought it.  There were 30 separate court decisions during the 9 Harper years, most of which we lost. How much did those losses cost? I found out the cost of two (2) of them so far, (from Hansard): the 2008 and 2010 Supreme Court cases - slightly over $625,000. What did the other 28 cost?  After the 2010 SCC decision confirming that our government had seriously violated his Charter rights, Khadr’s team amended the damage claim, way up – of course they did; they had more evidence and the biggest issue had just been proven. Did we try to negotiate a settlement then?  No. The Harper government left him in Guantanamo another 2 1/2 years, and over a dozen more court decisions.

Even the mighty Hollywood, California thought they didn't need their own tax incentives and as a result they lost thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to other locations who embraced them. We cannot afford to squander this amazing source of new money coming into the island by eliminating our tax incentives.

The right side won the Civil War, the USA.  Racism and discrimination of any kind by anyone is not only illegal but morally and ethically wrong.

The point of the article is that DHHL has failed miserably to spend the $38M in NAHASDA to do what these funds are for.

The hypocrisy would be breathtaking if this wasn't standard practise for Republicans these days.  Though given that this plan already has the ultra-conservatives railing against it for being insufficiently cruel to the poor, I'm not sure it'll even make it through the House; it's definitely not getting through the Senate.

Metro, on the other hand, may not blow the doors off but it's best in class and unless you need a 6% yield for income (in which case the lack of dividend reinvestment significantly impacts compounded returns) why would you care? Investors with six-figure incomes are better off with capital gains vs. dividends anyway making high-yield stocks a lesser choice for taxable accounts. By and large, they're also riskier. Mr. Heinzl's article was specifically intended to point out that a stock yielding only 1.7% should not be dismissed when superior management has grown the business as well as the dividend substantially and generated steady, above-average total returns over the course of many years. Some dividend investors screen for lower yields and automatically reject a stock on that basis. It's a mistake.

0,"In the recent past it was called a """"road purchaser credit"""" pertaining to timber sale contracts on federal public lands. The logging company which has been awarded the timber sale usually has to upgrade or even build new roads to remove and haul the trees away. The company gets big trees (usually at a huge subsidy) in exchange as payment for rebuilding or building new roads. However, they don't have to fix the roads after they are done using them. Once logging is done the good old taxpayer is responsible for its upkeep. Some may label that a form of welfare for big timber companies.  In Oregon and Washington on federal public lands there is over 120,000 miles of logging roads we taxpayers are now responsible for.

If citizens are more informed about their policies well in advance of the election, we allow people to have the chance to gain greater information and thus greater informed. By simply stating that people are ignorant and should not be allowed to vote undermines the idea of democracy. In the past, men prevented women from being allowed to vote simply because they regarded the opposite sex as unequal & more ignorant. The purpose of this piece was to give readers the chance to consider the high voter turnout in states like Oregon, Colorado, & Washington where the democratic institution has much higher rates of participation. States with higher turnout have demonstrated a push for more policies that are in step with the interests/needs of the greater population. There are no evidence that policies in these states have become 'dumber' because of high voter turnout.

The elector is appointed to perform the expressed will of the citizens of the State in the electoral process defined in the Constitution, not to represent them in that electoral process. Additionally, the quote you request was previously provided to you in the comment you responded to and there is nothing further to be gained by supplying the same text to you a second time.  Of course the legislature has the authority to direct the actions of a delegate of the State in the law that the legislature crafted.  To pretend otherwise is irrational.

0,"In the aftermath of the Holocaust, anti-semitism was temporarily driven underground by the magnitude of the Nazi's crimes. By the early 70s, this temporary lull began to wear off with the beginnings of the anti-Israel movement. The Jew haters of this world could feign innocence to that charge while hiding behind their vehement criticism of the Jewish nation.  Fast forward another generation or two and one increasingly sees that the primary stigma of the war, against anti-semitism itself, is now wearing off too. I don't really believe that there has been a rise in overall Jew hatred. We're just seeing it more clearly now.

0,"Kenneth:  We have over 300 million firearms in private ownership.  Such ownership is constitutionally protected and, barring a Constitutional Amendment, those 300 million guns will remain in private ownership.  I do agree that the NRA, which was once an organization representing sportsmen/women is now, unfortunately, largely controlled by the arms industry. Less than half the NRA funding now comes from individual membership.  Each day, of course, these manufacturers sell thousands of weapons as Americans attempt to """"arm themselves to safety.""""  Ironically, of course, the ready availability of firearms, according to all statistics, makes everyone around LESS safe.  Indeed, police officers are nervous....justifiably so.  Statistically, those """"domestic dispute"""" calls are among the most dangerous calls, and the more guns in those homes, the more dangerous it is.  It's easy to make arguments about the danger the omnipresence of firearms represents.  it's hard to find answsers for it.......

To the extent that the ideal citizen becomes that of Trump-like people versus people like Mr. Hecker this nation is not long for this world. The French knew what to do with people like Trump and their nation has been better of ever since.

However, critical speech is not what we are facing these days and it is not what we are protesting against.  In the 2016 Environics study of the Muslim community, Muslim youth was the LEAST optimistic about their future in Canada, and Muslim elders were the MOST optimistic. That should tell you the direction this country is headed if these simple motions are met with spin and politicking. Looking at this as a secular should not bring you to a different opinion. If anything is in danger of suppressing free speech, it can be brought to the Supreme Court. We have a Constitution for a reason. This is to address something that is honestly going to hurt everyone, not just Muslims.

0,"There was not any printing press in the Second Century.  The Liturgy was adopted to the area [province] where the people WERE Christian and celebrated.  There certainly wasn't any Liturgical 'watch-dog' group over-seeing developments in the liturgy.  This was done, not only in Greek, but in other languages in which the Liturgy was celebrated.  At this time, there was no Eastern and Western Churches.  For example, in the Chaldean and  Assyrian Rites, there are no words of Institution of the Eucharist, no consecration.  This went on for centuries [yes, they were and are faithful Catholics].  It was acknowledged with an agreement only on October 26, 2001.  There were other places during the Liturgies, where there is reference to the words of Jesus.  When the Benedictine Order was established, the monks undertook the task of printing by hand---Sacred Scripture and the Liturgy.  But there were mistakes as well in the hand printing.  When humans do anything, there are errors.

If it was your child maybe?  Let's put it this way.  For the purposes of the 4th Amendment, No Illegal Search clause, police may not use extraordinary means to conduct the search.  So, from a practical point of view, a police officer cannot use the Plain View doctrine of Evidence to determine suspicion, by using a pair of high-powered binoculars to view what is in plain view on your dining room table.

Instead, without any knowledge of Freyd, her publishing career or that of her better paid male colleagues, Bowers suggests that """"compression"""" is the cause of the disparity. Freyd's salary is paid by """"taxpayers"""" and therefore she should consider herself lucky, even if she is being discriminated against, because she makes 150K which is a nice chunk of cheese that evidently Bowers only objects to when paid to a woman.

It seems like in the beginning, when this was first noticed, it was brought to Clinton's chief of staff during a large meeting that did not include Clinton. She is shown as not wanting to give up her BB. This being a large security risk, why didn't national security make it clear that this wasn't an optional request? Very clear.

I'm not too confident the Trump administration has a reasonable view of immigration, though.  AG Sessions talks about """"criminal aliens preying on our citizens"""", but here in Hawai`i the new policies have deported a coffee farmer loved by his neighbors and others in the industry, a juggler who ran a circus for schoolchildren, and two housekeepers.  All of these people have US citizen children, which means that some of our fellow citizens will either grow up without one parent, or will have to leave the country of their birth.
