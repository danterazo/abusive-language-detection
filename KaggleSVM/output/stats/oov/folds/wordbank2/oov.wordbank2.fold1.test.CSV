1,"you are so incredibly stupid,, no all companies will not, see there is this thing called competition and it often comes from outside ontaro and even canada thus they have to compete and will have to cut jobs!,, , and the other provinces , please quebec already not a chance, etc, only the ones temporarily run by luantic leftis, but it wont last, elections in a year in several and the  game is over of you.. then look at places like apartments with rent controls from the libs,, they cant pass on costs and have essentially fix income stream thus they will be cutting jobs!, get educated, you are a fool

0,"A plea decrying unequal decrying! I'm glad to know you feel my decrying is important, although I don't see actual public support for addiction to opioids to decry. I will admit you have a point that there is a certain similarity; manufacturers are irresponsibly pushing out large quantities of a product that is being misused to the point of becoming a public health problem.

0,"It is not Sessions's future anyone needs to worry about. It is the fiasco that will result when Sessions leaves, is fired or what ever. Sessions has friends in Congress that Trump desperately needs. Sessions leaving will encourage others in the administration to also throw in the towel. What we all have to worry about is the abyss after Sessions. None of this ends well for the people of the United States and for that matter the citizens of the world.

0,"Mi Thoeni, Trump goes with the flow of what is needed to make the deal. He is NOT after money. He has all he needs at his stage of life. What he wants is a place in history as the greatest and most loved leader in the world. He will do what has to be done to get there. He views himself as a man with a huge heart and will act accordingly because that goes with the image he has of himself.
"
0,"I hear that a lot, but when I ask point out examples, they go blank, so when I read your comment, no examples, my response was """"And Your Point"""". Don't make a statement unless you have something to back it up,  why do you feel this way, not why others feel this way and your jumping on the band wagon.  At present when you listen to Trump and he outdoes himself everyday, attacking him is like shooting ducks in a pond, he is getting a head start on beating Obama as the worse.  He forgets what he said can be looked up, he cannot say he did not say it.  So please instead of making a one line statement, back it up, that is all you need to do.

0,"I know many who vote Liberal or NDP, the reason one of their biggest client is the government, think banks, insurance companies, construction workers, etc...

0,"We are talking tax cuts not increases. We need to grow the economy to generate more jobs-- growth not stay the same. Reducing the corporate tax rate to 15-20% is the rate which corporations are paying right now. So cutting the rate to what they are paying will do nothing to put more money in their hands. Second, when asked in polls from business publications and investment companies what they will do with money from tax cuts, corporate heads say they will continue what they are doing: buy back shares or distribute shares to shareholders-- an easy way to raise the value of their shares without making job producing investments. Reduce middle class rates-- so a guy with $2,000 disposable income gets $400 break gets you 20% growth multiplied by millions in the middle class. Give a guy who is spending $1 Million a year a $10,000 tax break gets you 1 % growth among the handful of rich guys. Consumption goes right into GDP growth and it gets multiplied quickly.

0,"A hypothetical scenario...  A firebrand imam in a mosque somewhere in the country begins radicalizing his community. He portrays Muslims as a group under attack in Canada.  His message is that Canadians don't understand Muslims, they hate them and the evidence is right there in front of their eyes. So it's time to """"push back,"""" he says over and over again, without actually recommending violence.  (So far so good, right? All the people here who insist on free speech support the free speech of that imam.)  Some time later, a radicalized youth from that mosque enters a church and murders six Christians. The country is aghast. A member of Parliament puts forward a motion asking the government to condemn the preaching of hatred and fear by any religion or group.  At that point, should Canadians reject the Parliamentary motion because it could have a """"chilling effect"""" on the freedom to preach hatred and fear? Yes, according to the usual suspects here. So what if people are killed by it?

In fact, the HEI """"business"""" model seems far more like the kind of extortion racket that has existed, and still does exist, in many formerly communist regimes, rather than good old American entrepreneurship!:)

1,"You keep whinging about my making misstatements about what you say, and here you are, doing EXACTLY that to me.  Marty, I don't like you. I haven't liked you for over twenty years. You are an ignorant, stupid blowhard who pretends to be neither ignorant nor stupid, but fails miserably. You claim to be an ardent follower of the magisterium, although in fact, you have shown that you are not.  You are dishonest and hypocritical. You will probably call this post uncivil, and one could argue that it is. It is, however, the last time I shall post in response to you. You typify all that is despicable in traditionalists -- dishonest, eager to have others do their thinking for them, ignorant of Church history and doctrine, narrow minded. I would not wish you a good day, since I am not a hypocrite.

He just bought his third house, which was 600,000 dollars and he is a millionaire. Trump is not any better but atleast he tells you who he really is. The problem with Burlington college and Mrs Sanders is she was way under qualified for the position and ran the college in the ground and then took 200,000 dollars from the failing college. This is after she bought a 10 million dollar piece of property which broke the college. Look politics and almost all politicians are dirty people, money corrupts people. Even the Dali Lama is a multi millionaire. The public is so un  educated on most governmental doings.

If the industry would like to spread odors, lets vote again. I also see a bit too much smoking in the parking lot outside some grocery stores etc.  The industry is fine if I can ignore it, but it is not ok if I smell it like the coffee roaster... That was not the deal when we voted.  I do not want our communities to be like Colorado Springs...  with dancing pot man ads and waiting behind confused, odiferous, slow customers at the store who get in to the car and drive away.  Honestly, I might want it legally available if cancer returns, but discreet and hidden. Control the smell like the industry propinents promised.

0,"Couldn't have said it better.  Next time try asking a polling question that includes the trade-off of higher taxes for the higher level of social services.  Then ask if that social safety net is sustainable if our largest trading partner and competitor is moving the opposite direction with taxes?  You could also ask if people feel there is an inflection point where higher safety net and corresponding higher taxes reduces incentives to work (receiving end is paid enough to do nothing and the biggest contributors work less because of crippling marginal rates).  Finally, ask if you think current federal and provincial governments are doing enough to reduce waste on overhead and low-value programs, in order to preserve essential social services without raising taxes?

0,"Thank you for your comment Paul.  I suggest there is a difference between inferring a person's principles and speaking to the general question of bias in relation to a judge.  I do not know McShane nor heard anything he has said.  I know nothing about him as an individual.  Yet, we as humans have general notions about how self interest can lead to bias.  My comments about McShane were not directed to McShane the individual but to a person whose personal interest could lead to bias in deciding a court case.  The concern was based on the general principle of self interest as in a woman judge would not normally try a case involving her son.   I know nothing about what is in the head of women who are assaulted.  Nevertheless, I have concern that society today has lost perspective on impact.  Sexual things are not as important as life itself.  I see people sentenced to 20 years for looking at a photo yet 10 years for murder.  This would never happen elsewhere in the world.

0,"Another senseless act that saddens us all, and our thoughts go out those affected. The argument that law-abiding citizens should be allowed to own guns seems rather ironic given that this shooter had no criminal record making him a law-abiding citizen. He will remain on record as a law-abiding citizen, as well, as there will be no conviction in this case. Many others cases like this exist in U.S. history. The gun lobbyist's 'law-abiding citizen' argument needs to be challenged.

0,"Think of how many abortions there have been since the dawn of time, Mr. Barrowcliff, if that's what you decide you should be bothered about but since you are incapable of getting pregnant or having children it seems a rather pointless preoccupation. It seems like something that someone would do who probably has a mental health issue. Mental fixation is a possible sign of dementia. Perhaps your letter is a cry for help. There are probably a lot of mental health providers out there who can help you,  Mr. Barrowcliff, with you mental fixation issues. Just don't wait too long and end up doing something weird and illegal like making your mental health problem someone else's and running into legal trouble. That would be unfortunate. Get the help you need.

0,"Unfortunately, the argument about alleviating congestion is often viewed as self serving - it simply allows smaller vehicles to move through the still congested traffic.  That said, there are plenty of circumstances in which a smaller vehicle can get through a tight space to make a turn and continue on - so why should filtering be that much different?  I think filtering (not splitting) could work well with the right restrictions, and it would work better if we can identify a way to introduce it gradually, because the public and more importantly driver awareness is going to be the greatest issue to overcome.  That will take a massive campaign, and the addition of material to the MTO knowledge tests for every class of license and driver training programs. I believe that for the vast majority of riders, self preservation will still be the guiding principle. That means that risks have to be understood, they have to be introduced in both novice and and advanced rider training programs.

The alt-right needs to be challenged and it's happening as all the marches show.  There will be a greater effort made in the future to protect the basically healthy societies that we have from those that hate.

0,"The term """"runaway warming"""" or """"runaway GHE"""" has a specific definition in climate science. For Earth, it would require about 80 additional W/m² of solar irradiance, bringing it to the K-I limit, boiling off all of the oceans while decoupling the Planck response, resulting in a surface temperature near that of Venus. No, you have not constantly heard this.  GCM projections have very successfully simulated a variety of future and past climate conditions.  Consensus reflects the state of knowledge of the scientific community. It is very much a part of science.  Speaking of which, again, the consensus """"best"""" estimate of ECS is 3ºC. (1.8 for TCR). Feedbacks supporting those values are clearly evident in simple calculations comparing forcing and temperature increase in the record. And, of course, glacials and interglacials in paleoclimate would not have been possible without those feedbacks.  Historically, human civilization has likely not seen global temperature as high as now.

0,""""".A vinyl record costs $2 to manufacture with markups often exceeding $20 per album""""  --  Not if you're paying master and mechanical royalties on it.  A 12-song album carries about $1.10 in mechanicals (songwriter royalties) plus whatever the artist's contract calls for.  Plus the original cost of manufacturing, plus shipping, advertising and discounts to retailers and returns.  Recording costs, mastering costs, package design can all be spread over all music formats but vinyl attracts its share of those costs.  So $2.00 as a base cost isn't even close.  The sale of 1000 units of vinyl (a big seller on vinyl) is going to pay for about an hour of the operation of a major label/distributor in Canada.  Much ado about very little.

The order includes exceptions for religious minorities coming from muslim countries (e.g. christians) and many in the Trump administration have referred to it as a ban on muslims.  Its this apparent religious test that is the basis of the constitutional challenge.

0,"Disagree.  Checked online and the Canary Islands has  Mount Teide with an elevation of 12,198 ft, just couple thousand feet lower than Mauna Kea, online pictures show that the mountain, like Mauna Kea Mount Teide has a gradual incline, meaning they can use roads to bring up building materials and ferry astronomers in/out of the new TMT telescope on Mt Teide.  Also the year round weather is pretty mild not that much rain, unlike some steep mountain in Nepal or Alaska always covered in snow or in a snowstorm.  Yes, shipping construction materials and workers to Canary to build the 30m TMT is much more difficult and expensive that building it in Hawaii and traveling US, Canadian, Japanese, etc. astronomers would have a much easier time traveling back and forth to Hawaii than to the Canary Islands across the Atlantic, but clear they cannot tolerate holding up the construction because of incompetence by those in charge in Hawaii and a small group of protestors.

0,"And what % of the road surface do the bikes occupy vs the motor vehicle?  Especially when we're talking dedicated bike lanes?  On Broadway it's something like 1/6th of the road surface, although that's probably the worst case.  But on many other roads with narrow dedicated bike lanes it's still something like 5-10% of the road surface dedicated to bikes, and of course it's 100% when it's a bike path built outside of the road completely.  Most of total road costs are not from repairing vehicle damage.  Most of it is in building the roads and bridges in the first place.  Vehicle damage is part of maintenance cost, along with damage from weathering (especially freeze/thaw cycles), snow plow damage, utility crews ripping up and patching roads, and other such factors.  It's a known fact that it costs a lot more to maintain CO roads that it does in AZ because of weather.  Obviously bikes do less damage than motor vehicles, but we shouldn't pretend that's where most of the cost occurs from.

The collision between the oil companies and their employees who, conveniently make up the decision makers in the government, is deplorable. This situation should never exist.  But this thought:""""Taking the PFD is the most regressive way to solve our budget problem. And for those who say you can't possibly fix our budget situation without using the Permanent Fund, answer me this: how does every single other state in the nation balance their budget when they don't have a Permanent Fund?""""  There is no other state in the union that is so completely reliant on one industry as a tax base, thus this particular part of your argument doesn't work.  Even if the $700MM production stimulus for the oil companies was cancelled, (as it should be) the $700MM from the PFD would still be required to fix the budget deficit.  We cannot sustain a deficit budget in our personal lives, we shouldn't in the government either.

Usually they put together an army and go steal the wealth of their neighbors.  Alexander the great, Genghis Kan, are 2 examples.  Looking at the current history book, what did the oil the other producing countries do when the price of oil fell? Kurdistan cut the cost of government 75% at the top end and at the low end 10 to 20%. Nigeria increased taxes on the poor and cut nothing.

But even the wealthy can't pay the amount needed.  The GET you will get from the poor is next to nothing.  It won't fund rail.  That was my point.  You have to tax the GET to pay for this boondoggle now.  There is no way to prevent all from paying it except on your taxes at the end of the year as a deduction which doesn't exist.  The poor pay no taxes.  By your way of thinking, all taxes are regressive.  That is just the way it is.  Gasoline taxes are regressive.

Nothing that indicates to me, as the person being asked to pay for this project, exactly where the tracks will go.  Whose property are they going to use? What lane of I-405 and I-5 will the take away to put the rail line down?  What will the environmental impact be?  I'm wary (and weary) of giving this organization money to do things they themselves don't really understand.   Ask for funding to develop a  comprehensive plan, and present that plan to us (taxpayers), and then ask for 54 Billion Dollars ( suspect it's actually going to cost a lot more than that in the long run).  2. It's not going to be ready for nearly 20 years.  Current technology will be obsolete by then.

Ten European countries, including highly socialist Sweden, provide better and more efficient health care.

0,"In all these discussions of this subject, I bring the primary responsibility back to the judges who refuse to take control of proceedings in their courtrooms.  Mr. Butt references """"aggressive"""" cross-examination.  Of course, every witness, including sexual assault complainants, should be available for rigorous cross-examination.  Whether that becomes """"aggressive"""" is up to the presiding judge.  If defence counsel wants to challenge the complainant with an alternate version of what happened (say, with respect to consent) then the judge can and should caution counsel that they had better be planning to introduce evidence to support their alternate hypothesis or else that entire line of questioning is going to be shut down.  Judges currently have the power to do that.  No fishing trips or blind accusations.  In the vernacular, put up or shut up.  Of course, in most cases counsel won't want to introduce that alternate evidence because it would mean putting the accused on the witness stand.

0,"Several reasons. Border officers have a legal power to refuse entry and direct persons back that inland officers do not possess.  Also once a person is physically within Canada, Charter rights are engaged and there is a right to have eligibility for a refugee claim assessed and then a hearing before an independent tribunal (the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board).  Back in 1985 the SCOC determined that the lack of an oral hearing for a refugee claimant before an independent tribunal was unconstitutional Singh v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177.  Singh determined that any person in Canada even without legal status was protected by the Charter.  That decision was based on section 7 rights to security of person and fundamental justice.

Father Fitzgerald was eventually forced out as director of the treatment center and replaced with someone more in line with the treatment philosophy of the Church. An opportunity was missed. Eventually the treatment center was forced to close. But not before many children in the surrounding areas were sexually molested by some of the patients at the treatment center. It seems that the priests were allowed to go into the local communities and say Mass and interact with the children. Several lawsuits were filed and settled by the Church. Mind you, this was 1963. Twenty some years before the scandal would first break in Lafayette, Louisiana with the arrest of Gilbert Gauthe who molested countless altar boys in rural Louisiana.

In any case, threatening to go to police isn't a crime.  If somebody repeatedly went to police to accuse men of sexual assault, the police would know from their investigation and act accordingly.  The bottom line is that most men accused of sexual assault will not have their name published, unless they're convicted.  It's a red herring.

This is why you look at homicide rates prior to the beginnings of gun control in the West in the first part of the 20th Century, and then as those restrictions were gradually increased to the strict controls first put in place starting in the '60s in most countries.  Prior to gun control there was equal access to firearms across the board and had been for decades, which means that we can compare the different cultures without gun -access- as a strong factor. The comparative rates from that point forward can then show us if, in fact, """"Americans are more murderous.""""  What we see is that for a variety of cultural and demographic reasons (assuming the false premise that violence is evenly distributed in our population, of course) we proportionately are, and have been since before 'gun control"""" could be entertained as a factor in any country. We have avoided the most stringent controls, yet we and they a century later are all essentially at the homicide rates of 1910.

Can you point to an area in the law that allows LEOs to kill people with impunity? No, you can't; but I can point to law that requires the government to adhere to standards of care of those in their charge, which is part and parcel of the government's ability to legally detain persons.

This man, with deep criminal ties in the Oregon cannabis community, falsely represented the will of OMMP Growers to line his pockets with a piece of the Recreational marijuana market this past session.  He made sure he was thee only one representing OMMP Patients in the hearing rooms, discrediting other Grower and Patient activists/advocates with the legislature.  Little did Anthony Taylor's dedicated OMMP Patient followers know, was that he was assisting the Recreational marijuana market transition medical marijuana Patients into consumers for capitalism knowing full well that the majority of OMMP Patients can not afford their medicine at Consumer prices.  What a con and crook.  It is concerning to me as a citizen of Oregon to have this man, a shining example of the adjusted marijuana criminal element in the OSP Report, continuing to haunt the halls of our Capitol.

0,"You are offering two choices that may not be the only options (fallacy of false dilemma). Obviously the first option to raise taxes won't work because you have determined that will hurt the economy. Which taxes increases will hurt the economy? How much of a tax increase will hurt the economy? And how much will the economy be hurt? The other extreme is to do nothing and hope for a great leader. A great leader may decide to raise taxes. Or cut jobs (things people do to make the State run). Or a combination. Let me offer another option: The Feds cut military spending. Just for an example: a 7% cut would free up enough money to double public housing across the nation. We just spent $22 billion for 3 Zumwalt missile destroyers. The entire HUD budget is $50 billion. It's a matter of priorities.

0,"Ms. Wilson-Raybauld claims that Canadian views are based on denial because, among other things, """"Indigenous peoples have to prove their rights in court even though they are recognized by section 35 of Canada’s Constitution"""". But this is hardly reason for complaint of any kind; the section in question only recognizes the existence of rights, it doesn't specify what those rights are. The only way therefore to determine the content of the rights in question is to claim them and then have that claim tested in court. Granted, we could have attempted to specify in the text of the Charter what those rights were, but I suspect that we would still be debating that matter today, more than 30 years later, if we had tried. Better to recognize the rights to begin with, then do the incremental work in the courts; that's a good thing, not a reason for saying that we're in denial.

Perhaps the similarity to Protestant forms of worship is a good starting point for building bridges of faith and charity and good will between Christians of differing traditions, and those with none. Unity of form is not needed; and neither is perfect agreement on matters of dogma and theology. There is already the ground for common agreement on the basics of the faith-God, the Holy Spirit, Jesus, the Word of God. The tribal meaning of groups and institutional forms and laws and rubrics is provisional;  it has a practical value in promoting unity among the members of a congregation and a church. Ultimately it fails in its mission if its concerns are limited to those pertaining solely to the survival of the institution bearing its name.

Between the longer distance to transmit the power to where it was needed and an attempt to pay off the developers to keep them quiet we drove up the cost of electricity by a billion dollars.

0,"I disagree with your comments. Firstly, the main purpose of a vaccination is to INFECT a person with the disease, just like catching it from a random person on the street. Only difference is that in the vaccine, the pathogen has been disabled in some way. Under these conditions, the body can create an immune response to the pathogen without having to suffer from the symptoms of a """"wild"""" infection, e.g. pox, swelling, inflammation. So to say that vaccines are making people """"weaker"""" is wrong because they are still being infected by the disease. Secondly, vaccines have decreased the incidence of many diseases (info on Measles and how the vaccine help fight it in the US https://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/webversions/InfectiousDiseases/activities/activity5_measles-database.html). Remember when smallpox was a thing? I don't, I was born a decade after it was irradicated, thanks to the help of inoculations and vaccines. Finally, lower mortality due to lower incidence of disease.

He certainly didn't continue to pursue the issue or try and get physical though. Pity.).  The whole saga certainly indicated a fundamental lack of understanding, and intelligence for that matter.

0,"I disagree with Berkowitz' contention that squatters on public land and violent crime are two different issues. He is wrong because both are lawless behavior. When the mayor takes a lenient position towards squatters on public land he is sending a message that some lawlessness is okay.  How are the squatters to determine where the mayor draws the line?  So the squatters then steal from nearby residents. They panhandle on street corners.  Then they get drunk and fight. The hoodlums take their clues from this behavior and start shooting.  No Mayor Berkowitz, it is all interconnected.  The notion that Mayor Sullivan decimated the police force is political nonsense. Berkowitz is looking for a scapegoat. Anchorage has 13 officers per 10,000 residents.  That is on par nationwide for a city our size.  Comparables are Las Vegas, San Jose and Fort Collins. Twenty more police will not make any difference.

0,"Absolutely managing your money takes time.  And for some using an adviser is the best option.  But just because you either don't have the time or inclination to manage your money does it justify giving up 22% of your return.  Especially when that return is only 6.8% to begin with.  The amount of time and skill it takes to generate 6.8% is relatively minimal - and not exactly the domain of a profession.  No different than having an accountant prepare your taxes and only claim the most basic tax deductions.  I have money and one of the reasons I have that money i that I was never too busy to look after it.  Most of the people I know that have money didn't get there by letting someone else walk off with 22% of their return while settling for returns that could and probably should be closer to 10% under the management of a pro.

0,"Notice that in Genesis 3:15-16 the woman, is spoken of in both the spiritual and natural context meaning we cannot separate the two. The same is shown in Ephesians 5:22-24.  We should remember that Adam and Eve were the first members of God's church on earth. God already said the man is to rule the woman (both as wife and as church). Thus within a church setting, God prefers men to rule the flock.  In 1 Timothy 3:4, 5, when talking of the Bishops, Paul said they were to be rulers in their homes. In Genesis we already saw that the position of ruling was given to the man, not the woman. If he ruled his home well, he could be trusted to rule the church.  So when we talk of Elders and Pastors, we are talking about rulers. We already saw which gender he chose to rule the church. In both the home and the church setting, things are the same.

0,"Indeed, Trump was the worst presidential candidate in US history, and at this point it seems he will have been the worst president in US history. That doesn't alter the fact that he won, not on votes by the people, but by a peculiar distortion of the democratic process found in the US and nowhere else in the world. He won less than a plurality of votes from those who wanted """"change"""", a change meaning a return to the US of the 1950's, including the good, the bad, and the ugly. Those voters deserve to be disappointed, because the US can't, won't, and shouldn't return to the bigotry, the divisiveness, the ugliness and distrust of that era. Those who believe in progress were divided in how much progress they wanted, and how fast. The upshot is that they (we, all of us) got the exact reverse of what we wanted.

Conscience is the ultimate connection between the individual soul and God.  Francis knows this, believes it with a quiet, dogged passion that wants to shape the church and our relationship with the institution as a wise, intelligent, well-meaning and accompanying soulmate.

The law provides a list of excluded benefits, but discounts are not listed.  Traditionally CRA did not tax minor discounts provided they amounts were reasonable and did not exceed the cost of the product to the employer.It is absolutely irrelevant that such discounts were part of a collective agreement..... in fact, such discounts should be taxed. The CRA position was an administrative position and they are free to take such positions in administering the law even if they do not accord with the law. Equally, they are free to change such positions, provided the new position is supported by the law. The recent change in position was.  That doesn't mean it was good politics or policy.

Khadr was, in fact, a traitor as he is and was a Canadian citizen fighting against us and our allies. Canada is not responsible for his the capture. Canada is not responsible for imprisoning him. Canada is not responsible for his treatment. Canada was responsible for interrogating him while he was being sleep deprived (See Supreme Court ruling) and that was done under the Chretien Liberals. The Court also ruled that the government (Chretien, Harper, Martin) was under no obligation to repatriate Khadr So, Canada's responsibility is minuscule, certainly not $10.5 million worth.

I've worked in film and TV since the late 1990s and I can tell you from  experience, women behind the scenes--from above the line creative: writers, producers, directors, show runners, etc., right down to crew members--make up a small fraction (less than 20%) of that workforce. And don't get me started on studio executives making the decisions, the stats more abysmal.  I'm referring to prime-time and late evening creative content for adults. Not the daytime fluff that most working women never see unless held hostage in a nail salon while The Social natters on about the perfect moisturizer.  This is why the content is what it is.  Doyle is right because the  unfortunate truth is that men still control the vast majority of executive positions in the film/TV industry and that means they control the money, and money controls what gets made.

0,"Richard, if you want to be pedantic - and channel Paris Dennard - then yes it's true that Obama did not specifically condemn Roof or white supremacists. However the reality is that Roof was arrested shortly before Obama's initial speech and therefore he could not comment on the ongoing investigation. Obama did clearly talk about the racially based motivation for the attack. Roof's involvement with white supremacy was not clear at the time although the racial motivation itself was clear.  Compare that to what happened in Charlottesville where obvious, even self described, white supremacists gathered and it doesn't take a genius to figure out what was going on. Yet instead Trump equivocates in his initial response, equates the anti-fascist protestors with the Neo-Nazis (and conveniently forgets that he did so when he referred to it in Phoenix). It then takes hm 2 days to clarify his position and condemn the white supremacists.  I don't see a double standard, I see a lack of leadership.

For some inescapable reason, people refuse to see that it's no more right for the government to do it than for a mugger in a park.  And, 6 (SIX) other states do not have an income tax. The fact that you don't know that is telling.  Lack of an income tax does not mean you don't pay taxes, but it does mean that you aren't disincentivized from working. AFTER you've made your income, you then are free to choose what to spend your money on and which taxes are truly worth paying ... based on your own priorities. It also requires that everybody actually have some skin the game because everybody will pay some taxes, somewhere, instead of being allowed to wriggle out of most or all of them as an income-based tax now allows to 47% of the working population.

0,"No statewide recount, much less a nationwide recount, would have been warranted in any of the nation’s 58  presidential elections if the outcome had been based on the  nationwide count.  The state-by-state winner-take-all system is not a firewall, but instead causes unnecessary fires. “It’s an arsonist itching to burn down the whole neighborhood by torching a single house.” Hertzberg  The 2000 presidential election was an artificial crisis created because of Bush's lead of 537 popular votes in Florida. Gore's nationwide lead was 537,179 popular votes (1,000 times larger). Given the minuscule number of votes that are changed by a typical statewide recount (averaging only 274 votes); no one would have requested a recount or disputed the results in 2000 if the national popular vote had controlled the outcome. Indeed, no one (except perhaps almanac writers and trivia buffs) would have cared that one of the candidates happened to have a 537-vote margin in Florida.

For Example: considering the number of posters who cry over the cost of health insurance, that only cover part of their medical needs, there is a failure to include insurance cost that as part of the overall items they pay for in addition to direct taxes. Then you have to consider the deductibles and medical services not cover by your insurance against coverage in another country with no deductible or co-pays for services.

0,"The per barrel """"credit"""" is, according to Rep. Gara, a misnomer. This """"credit"""" acts to reduce the effective tax rate - it is essentially a reverse progressivity designed to reward production.  When people mention credits, I believe they are referring to the ~ $700 million that companies earned from the Exploration Incentive Credit, the Loss-Carried Forward Credit, the Capital Credit or the Cook Inlet Well Credit.  These credits incentivize investment by subsidizing the cost of certain expenditures. The $8 per barrel credit is not part of the $700 million (or whatever the actual # is) that we owe to those that have earned credits. Moreover, the level of the per barrel credit depends on the price of oil - the credit goes down as prices go up.

0,"Your sense of accompany and study is clearly not what Francis means.  Your sense presumes as self-evident that the companion knows what is morally correct for the person in question beyond a shadow of doubt. Francis begs to differ. He understands that Jesus unambiguous command to not judge applies to assuming we know what is objectively correct for this person in this situation.  Now, were we not working under new rules of civility, I might go so far as to suggest that your approach is arrogant in relation to the other, and that is not Jesus' approach. But since we are under new rules, I won't say anything remotely like that. ;-}  Yes Jesus did condemn the Pharisees, but in general terms his condemnation tended not to be for their own action about themselves, but about their harmful actions towards others. Not completely unlike your approach of finding virtue in imposing a burden. Again I know you understand my gist is not derogatory, despite ad hominem implications. ;-}

A child who is born a hermaphrodite is the only circumstance where sex is unclear.  Are we now going to question the sex of animals as well?  Science and Biology is very clear. A male can never conceive a child , and a female can never fertilize  the egg of a woman.  Are you stating that I can be a man today, a woman tomorrow and neither the next day, and science will back my beliefs up? If I really believe I am a Black male, even though I was born a white male, is it possible for me to have my skin pigmented and become black?  This gender issue is diabolical in my opinion.

His and his subordinates subsequent boycotting of police services to the Whiteaker hasn't exactly built any trust. Command staff continues to lie to the community about this boycott, although several patrol officers have been candid about it, which has also not exactly helped build trust. At this point, we know the command staff at EPD is being untruthful when we see their lips moving.  Ruiz is now faced with yet another test that he will likely fail. EPD needs a housecleaning. The new chief needs to come from outside, but not be someone just looking for a cushy pre-retirement gig. I'm not optimistic, given Ruiz track record of hiring decisions.

Currently the language laws are pretty much in compliance with the Charter.  So, no cherry-picking, alwordman.  The Courts determine which rights are legitimate, and yes, they do it with great skill.

These people and the ANC as a whole, should be prosecuted for HIGH TREASON, and nothing else.  This is total betrayal of the people who put these criminals in power, and have sworn to defend every cadre sent to the SOEs by the Guptas.  This was also evident after the Constitutional Court's judgement in the Inkandla verdict when Zuma was found to have flouted and disregarded the oath he took when being sworn in as president of this nation, and to protect the constitution against foreign and domestic foes, and the National Assembly did nothing to hold him accountable.  My whole respect in this mess, goes to the Economic Freedom Fighters party, which said then, and still say Zuma lied.

Since the medications for these disorders are not controlled substances, the prescriber would not have worry about losing his/her license or being charged with a felony if someone made a case of it.

What's noteworthy (and therefore ignored) is that since cops were recently pressured into at least FABRICATING their kill-counts according to 'race', 72 of 'em in 2015 were described as 'race unknown'.  What?  Did they EXPLODE when the cops shot 'em?  Melt?  Vaporize like vampires in sunlight?

And, yes, pick up trucks are 7% of Canada's GHG but pick up trucks are heavier than cars and will not have pure electric range for many years to come.  The internal combustion engine is dramatically more efficient than even five years ago such that, even without any government subsidized shift to EVs, GHG emitted from cars will continue to diminish as old is replaced with new.

The USA-coalition's campaign in Mosul has run for far longer than the campaign for Aleppo did, and it has caused more than double the average weekly civilian casualties as were caused in Aleppo. So, if Aleppo was a tragedy (and it was), than what is Mosul? If there was nonstop Western MSM hype over Aleppo, then shouldn't there be just as much, or even more than double the hype concerning Mosul, Iraq? If Russia was framed negatively for Aleppo, then shouldn't the USA and its allies be frames perhaps more than twice as badly for Mosul, Iraq (and for all their other M.E. wars and creation of terrorists)? Aleppo was a case of Western MSM opportunistic propaganda, because it was about creating a conniving impression of how bad the campaign was, without ever mentioning Western nations' own concurrent campaign, which was, and is far worse than Aleppo.

You could run a sack of marbles as a candidate representing any of the 3 leading parties and it could attract as many votes as a living human being if both were to represent that same party.  There are some commenters on electoral reform who insist we all vote for individuals to represent us in government however, I say to them that, in practise, the vast majority of votes end up being markers for political parties.  Electoral reform needs to be modeled on reality, not on theory.

If a candidate makes entirely unacceptable statements on tape and film there is no denying he made those racist, sexist, misongynistic, xenophobic, bigoted comments. When voters choose to vote for that person in spite of his normally disqualifying uncivil statements then they are approving of and normalizing behavior that until now was considered off limits by any standard of decency in our society. Trump crossed numerous lines that until this election no candidate would ever utter in public but instead of finding those comments gross, rude and boorish you and your fellow travelers reinforce the ugliness by voting for or defending what we teach our kids not to do.

Yes, under a succession of U.S. presidents, North Korea has made slow, steady progress on its bid to join the nuclear club. But it is naive to think its rapid acceleration on Trump's watch is purely coincidental. Is there any doubt the launch of its first ICBM on Independence Day was intended to call Trump's bluff. 'A gift for the American bastards' was Kim's gleeful retort to Trump's litany of desperate, dismissive comments.  Better to shut-up than engage in empty threats and ridiculous assurances you can't back up. Kim is well aware Trump has so isolated himself from other G20 leaders, compromised himself with Russia, and foolishly misread China's motives that there is almost no chance now that he can achieve international consensus on dealing with this rogue state.  Never in modern times has America been so badly represented on the world stage.

Along comes Trump, who is proving the real white entitlement in the US is the white male right to the expression of anger and aggression.  Poor HRC, she doesn't get to express anger either because women don't have the right to anger any more than black males. Trump will rely on his entitled right to anger and aggression until he's taken the blinders off of everyone.  That will be his downfall and perhaps his only contribution as president.

But in markets with less competition, it is easier to, for lack of a better expression and to steal a line from Adam Smith, have an invisible hand guide them to uncompetitive behavior that mimics deliberate and active coordination. To the players of seems like they are competing and they mostly believe they are competing, but it is not the kind of competition envisioned by economic theory, so it does not help with real and original innovation or price competition (meaning something like price equals marginal cost in economic speak). The Colleton bureau is corrupted. By that I do not mean dishonest, they simply have a distorted view, on practice at least, of what economic competition really is.

I think Obama can rightly be criticized for being overly sensitive to that. Firing the Director does not stop the investigation; by firing Comey, Trump probaby gave the investigation a boost. But Trump has been clear that he's trying to impede it; he's just too dumb to know that he can't, not in any significant or lasting way. (The White House is not Trump Tower.)

Russia is working with Iran and has made progress toward permanent bases there. Strategically, Russia having air bases and military in Iran will give them a strong position in the region and could give them air superiority. Russia's clear objective is to gain air superiority and push us out of the Mideast. This is the reason Russia is supporting Assad in Syria as it gives Russia additional air fields and bases. A danger facing us soon is a pro Iran movement in Iraq which has covert Russian support-- if this group captures the Iraqi elections in 2018 they will ask us to leave Iraq and we lose bases and support there.

The first is when the spy agency deems the information sufficiently important. The second is when the spy agency offering the torture confession offers a disclaimer like this:  """"Senior American defence officials acknowledged Wednesday that U.S. forces have been involved in interrogations of detainees in Yemen but denied any participation in or knowledge of human rights abuses.""""  Short of a Canadian spy actually witnessing a prisoner being tortured, the Canadian government will use the information obtained under that torture. Worse yet, even if the Canadian spy DID witness the torture, the government will still use the information if it deems it important enough. In other words, Canada will use virtually any information obtained via torture, in contravention of its international obligations.

0,"rhockin, for the most part, I agree with you. I'm concerned about small businesses, which employ about 1/3 of Ontarians.  Many of these entrepreneurs work long hours and live humbly.  Minimum wage hikes of 30-something % is money directly out of the small businessman's pocket.  Soaring hydro rates and increases to CPP (all of which have recently happened) are quite a financial burden as well. This is why I simply can't believe that Wynne gives a dam about business (our tax base) and I'll actually venture to say that she'll love the extra tax revenue the wage hike will bring to her empty coffers.  Remember Ontario is hugely in debt, and yet needs to keep the public sector unions happy during contract talks by offering wage increases, plus enviable benefits and gold-plated pensions.  This is all done with money she doesn't even have, and the tax payers are stuck with the bill! I'll say it again--she's a morally & ethically corrupt politician who's buying votes with our $$.

First, there's costs to the state like I mentioned with moving prisoners down and back, whether for court appearances, incarceration or release.  Second, there is a long-term issue with recidivism rates. Moving inmates Outside removes many from their families and other means of social support. Maintaining ties to healthy family and friends relationships have been found to be a critical aspect in reducing long-term recidivism. If we fail to do this, the same person will just end up back in the system over and over costing us money.  Finally, it's a political grenade no one wants. DOC wants them here to justify funding, nationally there's a push against for-profit prisons, and the Legislature doesn't want to send more of our limited money Outside when it could be used here to improve our economy and doesn't want to lay off Alaskans to send jobs to the L48 etc.

Therefore, the provocation by the Board had to have been very high, for Providence to decide it could no longer work with this Board, whose chair is Susan Hanson.  I will be saying more about all of this, but in the meantime, I have a suggestion.  I am asking all of the families of residents to come together, and demand of the VCC board an accounting for their actions.  In particular should this Board assure, and reassure, the families, and thus the residents, that there will be no closure, and thus no sending of our residents to other places, which would have to be off-Island.  For the VCC Board has broken faith with the Island community, which word is still in """"Vashon Community Care"""".  I am working to have our families become involved.  I will be announcing my Way Forward, for there is one, in Beachcomber shortly.  But be not deceived-this is a very serious matter, and threatens the existence of our VCC.  Captain Joe

Here is one, and not the bloodiest by any means...""""Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you...Slay them whenever you fall upon them...apostasy by force is indeed more serious than slaying...Fight them until there is no longer apostasy, and the religions is Allah's.""""  (Sutra 2:189). The issue with Muslims in the West is not whether or not they are terrorist threats,  the issue is precisely at the source of their religion...the Quran.  It is apparent the religion is in need of scripture criticism as there was an initial period of biblical criticism out of Germany in the early 19th Century.  But it isn't going to happen in the Muslim stream, and as a result this evil cult will ultimately collapse.  We can see it happening all around us.

I'm of the belief that the Democratic Party is big enough, wide enough, and strong enough to accommodate many views on this issue, unlike the Republican Party, which tolerates only one, firm absolute position. As many have said before, being pro-choice doesn't necessarily mean being pro-abortion. Speaking only for myself, I would like to see abortion remain a safe, legal medical procedure in order to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by pregnancy. Such cases may be rare, but they do happen, and the law should take them into account. The bishops may make no distinction between a fetus and a mother with a family, but I do, and I know how I would behave if I had to make a choice as a legal caregiver.

They waited patiently for him to arrive, but it was the Japanese Prime Minister who announced he was a no-show. The word """"screwed"""" was being used by those present. Back home I think words like """"embarrassed"""" and """"ashamed"""" would be appropriate in describing the reaction to our Prime Minister's behaviour in front of 10 major allies and trading partners. Justin Trudeau has yet to learn what leadership and diplomacy mean, for he possesses neither of these attributes.

0,"I have been fervently promoting #ZilleMustFall on the basis of her position up till the apology conference; now I believe she deserves another chance to redeem herself. Why did I make this apparent U-turn? Because, anyone who knows her, knows how utterly embarrassing this massive climb-down was for her. It is a pity how little empathy exists among the many people who claim this was a farce. Try putting yourself in her position, knowing all that you know about her. Imagining sitting right next to your boss who repeatedly tells the millions of people watching (or even just the few dozen in the room) how you cocked up. I shiver! But I must qualify my satisfaction by saying that she, and most politicians (most people) don't truly understand how to apologise. They always add some sort of qualification. The people to whom the apology is due, are not particularly interested in the apology per se; all they need is for the offender to show they genuinely understand how wrong they were.

Into a battle against the Vatican! Amazing blunder on his part. As for Boeselager, I cannot recall exactly what vow he had taken. It was reported that he felt that the request to resign (and then the order of dismissal) was grossly unjust. Also, that the Order's proper procedures had not been followed. And this last element must have been acknowledged as true by the Order, since (alongside the Papal commission of investigation) there had begun an internal review enquiry, at Boeselager's request. And thank goodness that Boeselager did resist the unjust orders - or none of this nonsense between Burke and Festing would have come to light.

Very clearly the US government can't support the lawsuit because that would open up the can of worms where US soldiers could be sued for their actions during war. The US opposed the International Criminal Court because they did not want their soldiers subject to judicial processes outside of the US.

I use this app in Costa Rica, and it is absolutely the best app you can put on your phone there.  Almost 10% of the population uses it.  It is much more than Google Maps.  Try it.

Ms. Notley needs to begin the work of changing GOA culture and keep the promises she campaigned on. To date, I see no differences between the NDP and the PCs.  We have broken promises in the continuing care system, no sort of change to problems of retribution using the Trespass to Premises legislation created by the PCs and kept happily by the NDP.  We have no change period. I voted NDP for change and I feel betrayed. The most vulnerable citizens in Alberta are given these tired political responses of a panel and a new ministry while recommendations made through decades wait for implementation. It's a farce that began in the PC error and continues in the NDP error.  Sadly only the kids suffer.

This is the area I studied academically & musically. I loved being a part of OBF growing up - watching the cantata rehearsals & performances every afternoon from 5th grade through high school & ultimately singing in the choir, and as much I adored Herr Rilling, the lack of shift towards historical performance practice has always been a detriment in my view. So the fact that they have fired the person who was finally implementing it tells me that they only want money and have no idea what they are doing musically. The idea of  guest curators from Jazz and even choreography tells me that there will be no consistent musical theme to the festival across time. This will be its deathnell, in my opinion.

With the rise of secularism discussing secularization as a historical process seems rather to miss the point. The Church, the culture is now having to deal with those who aggressively advocate for a new sort of society thoroughly secularized. This is where the real issue lies and this is the real form of secularization that Christians must contend with. The days of dealing with secularization as a passive historical force are over. Christian failed to creatively respond to secularization, particularly over the last 100 years. Another failure respecting secularism, may be, well who knows?

0,"I always find the Star Wars/Star Trek debate funny because they seem so different to me that I have a hard time understanding how the two can be compared. Star Trek was created as a series of books and an episodic TV show, meaning that it was meant to have discreet stories told and wrapped up in a short time. Star Wars, on the other hand, was written as a series of movies with a far-reaching storyline. Star Trek is meant to be set in our own future, complete with our history and built upon our understanding of the real universe. Star Wars, however, exists """"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."""" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic. There are many other reasons, but fundamentally, comparing SW and ST does not seem like an appropriate comparison. (Also, if you insist on comparing them, it would probably be best to be done by someone with a reasonable degree of knowledge of both properties.)

0,"Mortgage default rates are always low while the economy is growing (they are a lagging economic indicator).  For your education historically mortgage arrears used to be much lower than that.  Specifically, the major banks (who represent the majority of the industry) used to have default rates <5bps in the 1980s - 1990s when I worked in the industry and tracked that data.  Canadians are definitely living beyond their means, savings rates have steadily diminished, inadequate savings for retirement or contingencies, etc. etc. This will become very apparent in the years ahead as people must retire with inadequate financial resources. Also if interest rates rise at some future date (interest rates move in long cycles and the next cycle is an upswing) it will be painfully obvious.

Could it be they were-gasp!-lying? And could it be that they are taking their time now primarily for political expediency, so they can retain theirs seats while they implement their plan to slowly screw the American people over, hoping that they won't notice if they do it little by little, as opposed to all at once? And finally, could it be that they know people are going to find out just how many lies they've been fed by the Republicans on all fronts-not just healthcare-so they're waiting to come up with the right spin to keep their base convinced everything they're doing is Ibama and the progressives fault.  The answer to all is a resounding YES.

That would necessarily involve wiping out all supply lines and destroying the country's infrastructure.  The regime would collapse within a few days.  But, at that point, who's responsibility are the some 25,000,000 people in the collapsed regime now facing imminent death by famine?  It would not go down well simply to walk away and say let them fend for themselves, but propping them up would be logistical hell, astronomically expensive, and Iraq-in-spades squared.

There isn't anywhere else to cut unless you want to feel it on the street where people live. Everyone of those citizens will have different plans that someone else will disagree with.  2) The state employee salaries (real earnings) are made public every year. The average salary last year was around $22/hr or $43,000/year for a professional. Many could make much more in the private sector, which is why state employees are hard to retain.  3) PERS has already changed. Tier IV PERS operates like a 401K, most Tier I and II folks are retired or close anyway, though you could offer early retirement to clear some of it out. Tier III is the weakest pension plan of the 3. Our unions (there's about 7) haven't negotiated deals like the MOA unions have, nor do they aim to.

"""" -  It seems that the 'morning after pill' is only an abortifacient if indeed there is a fertilized ovum. - If there is not a fertilized ovum then nothing is aborted. From one perspective then this is birth control which  under the circumstances of rape is not a grievous matter, much less a sin. - Despite what some might insist upon, the raped woman should take the 'morning after pill' as soon as possible without first determining if the ovum is fertilized. That this is so is premised on the fact that the medical technology for determining this is not available to everyone as soon after rape as needs be, and the premise should be that most if not almost all ovum generally are not fertilized so the intent to prevent pregnancy is a neutral act especially in the context of  recovery from rape.

You see why we need to finish the revolution that started in the 1960's. Because when miscreants like Ronald Reagan, all the fanatic religious evangelists like Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority,  Brian Mulroney in Canada, attacked everything the boomers accomplished in the 60's and 70's, most of them were married and unfortunately did not fight back. Generation X was too timid to carry on with the move towards democracy, equality, inclusiveness, and an economy that works for all. Thus all the elitist institutions and corrupted dysfunctional democracy we are burdened with today in North America, with all its religious divisions causing so much trouble, drifting ever further to the right wing where militarism, corporatism, fascism, and religion march in lock step keeping the people down.

Finally, that leaves the decision on a special counsel to Rob Rosenstein and was no one aghast at how quickly that happened?  I believe this was set up a long time before it happened and with Robert Mueller pre-picked.  Sure they floated out names but, once they chose Mueller, the deep state Republicans and Democrats were out there cheering.  I believe the Democrats are really going to pay for this in 2018.

He also stopped building anything, including roads, hospitals, seniors lodges, etc. Some of that infrastructure deficit had to be made up in the last few years, especially with an overheated economy drawing mostly young people with children to the province. In fact, a large part of the deficit addressed in the article has gone to capital spending on schools alone, just to build to keep up with the youngest population in the country.

On the other hand, Mr Trudeau swept to power with a government based largely on symbology and the perception of wanting change. He promised everything to everyone.

0,"What does Sunday have to do with it? People of conscience should continue agitating non-stop against cuts to Medicare and patient protections.  22 million who now have coverage will be uninsured. Those left with Trumpcare will no longer be protected from the high costs of a cancer diagnosis and other chronic conditions. Insurance companies will be free to once again charge rates most people can't afford for pre-existing conditions. The patient protection part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) will be gutted, thanks to the Cruz Amendment included in the latest version of the Senate's wealthcare bill, which delivers big tax cuts to the most affluent Americans by taking away from the poor and working people. The GOP has no healthcare plan and never did. Their only plan is take away whatever benefits the uninsured were able to acquire during the past eight years and transfer the funds saved to the wealthy in the form of tax cuts.

I'm sure that there are many, many reasons other than rape or aggression. I doubt that it's as easy a decision as choosing toast or biscuit. The issue is, the woman is the one carrying the baby. We are not breeding stock, we are not property. I can not imagine being forced to carry an unwanted child to term. I support health care including abortion for women and children. Better yet, universal health care, excluding Viagra. It's kind of like the notion of Civil Unions before gay marriage was legalized - health care for women and children is at least a start.

I used to go to ABT, but after some irresponsible statements made by visiting pastors & Prevo's stand on some of the same issues as you mention I have quit going to ABT. I had written up several letters to him about some of the flaws I have noticed in the preachings, but never sent them. I was told by a member of the church that I would never be permitted to have an appointment with him either. I was told that he is too busy, although I interpreted it to mean that he is too important to visit with me as I'm a less important member of the church.  For one thing, I don't bring him homemade ice cream nor do I bring him M&Ms. I have yet to look for a church to go to, but hope to find one that follows Jesus'  teachings.  I believe that Jesus was more accepting of the difference people have.  I don't think you have to throw out the baby with the bath water & stop believing in Jesus. I'd recommend being more selective of where you go!

Most likely, teenagers don't really know much about the different careers available.

Then use the current formula to determine the PFD amount and  limit any state income tax due from those listed on a tax return to that PFD amount.  At worst, the PFD would directly offset all state income tax due.  At best, your property tax offset might qualify you for a full PFD.  In either event if the state would control spending  you could still realize more of  a PFD payment; however, If the state spends so much that they can't issue a PFD then they also cannot collect any income tax revenue that year.   In other words you could never owe more in state income tax than what you would have received as a PFD payment and the people would demand spending control to insure a maximum PFD which is the basis of Jay Hammond's argument.

Currently, Oregon is 50th, dead last, in corporate taxes in relation to total taxes. We have no sales tax. That makes our goods and services a bargain.  People who don't work in schools don't realize just how much we lost in the last recession. We are still dealing with its effects, including large class sizes. Many of our first- and second-graders will struggle throughout their years in school.  Oregon's boom-or-bust way of funding schools needs to change. We need more stable funding, including being able to set aside money for those times when the national economy is in recession.  If this measure passes, it will have a profound effect on our options during a recession. Ultimately, we will have better educated children. This benefits everyone, including businesses.

If he were younger with the prospect of a long career in the Senate afterward, it would be a different matter.  But let's face it -- he's long past that point now.  He'd just be doing a disservice to the Senate, the country, and his party if he doesn't step down and hand the reigns to someone else.  Especially now, while his party has a slim 52 seat majority where as we've seen, just a few Senators on each end of the spectrum can torpedo legislation.  Even one vote is HUGE.

These finding could also be used to dramatically change the face of Industrial Agriculture, but that will never happen because of this obsession with corporate greed through obscene profit making.

It speaks well of Anchorage and her voters that ensuring the common good exceeds selfish personal interests.  It is unfortunate that the four conservative former mayors of Anchorage fought so hard and successfully to reject the additional bond proposal. Neoliberal austerity as advocated by conservatives nationally is counterproductive in the long term. I certainly hope that none of those four or any of the people who they convinced to vote no are never in an unmet need for ambulance or other services that would have been funded by the bonds.

He fell asleep on duty, and received a vote of no confidence by the police officers that served under him. He led the charge to abolish civil service so he could hire and fire at a whim. His decision making put officers in harms way. He would show up at SWAT calls and try and run the show. There was extremely high turnover on the force (around %40), and morale was in the toilet. My advice is get rid of him. He is a cancer than needs to be cut out of law enforcement. PS. Ask him about the vicious toy poodle that he killed with OC pepper spray. :)

Because civil law is largely a matter for state and provincial governments, it was necessary to get those governments signed on, which is why the agreement is not a treaty; the junior governments can't make treaties. Under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments agreement, default judgments are not enforceable. Further, there is a question of jurisdiction. Speer's widow brought an action in a US court against a Canadian on account of wrongs allegedly committed in Afghanistan. The general rule in torts is that you can sue in the place where you find the tortfeasor (which I believe was Alberta at the time the suit was launched) or in the place where the wrong was committed. No Canadian court would accept American jurisdiction in this case.

Pork because of what pigs eat and quick decay.Camels because they gave hair for clothing and transport over the dessert.Unfortunately a lot of diseases  can spread through homosexuality and that might be a reason to be called a sin.Christians generally believe that God will punish you if you sin.God do not micro manage us as we all have a free will to do what we like.If we skip a traffic light, chances are good that we would be involved in an accident.That is natural law kicking in and not God.All sins in the Bible involves are things that hurt other people.

People on Medicaid don't have deductibles or copays like the rest of the population.  I find it interesting that only 42.3 million Americans live in poverty.  This is 13% of the population, but we need to provide medical coverage to 31.8 million Americans through taxpayer dollars.  We still have 31.1 million Americans uninsured. This is 9.6% of the population.  I bet most of the people in the United States don't realize that in the 1940's very few people had any medical insurance.  We also have permitted our elected officials to create a medical cost crisis for the country as medical services is now 17% of the GDP.  Not sustainable.

That is ONE system. Can it be allowed to overwhelm the thousands of examples in Canada which work?  Health care in the private sector would mean that people who can pay, pay. Just like all other goods and services in Canada. Those who can't pay would require help, as they do now for every service and product.  Having people pay, and according to US data that would be about 85% of Canadians, would no longer be a charge on the taxpayer. Deficits no longer for health care.  Canadians would have a choice of level of care and cost. Not like now where all Canadians have to pay top price. Imagine only about 15% of Canadians would require help. 1 in 6.

Additionally, if we had a flat rate income tax, everyone would pay an amount that they could afford to pay and it would be deductible from federal income tax. Why not keep our tax money in the state? We could make the first $20,000 income-tax-free for everyone, so that really poor people would not be damaged. A sales tax is harder to manage as we should make sure that life's necessities are not taxed (food, water, heating oil). When I say """"food"""", I'm not referring to sodas, fast food, candy, and so on. Those items should be taxed if there is a sales tax. Alaskans should pay for the services they receive from the state and an income tax is the fairest way to do that. Reducing the PFD is the worst way as it impacts poor people more than the rich.

0,"Part 3 of 12 C. Jules Bailey opposes holding city council accountable for its failure to maintain Portland’s roads. Which of the following most closely resembles your views on how to resolve Portland’s street repair deficit problem? A. Prioritize Street Repair In General Fund Budget. B. A New Portland Gasoline Tax Of Ten Cents Per Gallon.   Answer A. For more than thirty years the Portland city council has redirected and misappropriated budgeted funds for street repair to their pet projects. There is every reason to believe this practice will continue.  ANY size Portland gas tax is a vote in favor of allowing political skulduggery without consequence.   ANY size Portland gas tax is a vote against an essential value of a democracy which it to hold publicly elected officials accountable for their actions in office.

Furthermore, the State passed a specific measure in 1992.  Apparently that law wasn't binding on the Navy, but it greatly antedates the 2015 Fed-Navy agreement and makes the State's position crystal clear.  So even if the Navy is exempt from State law, at least Hawai'i made a record early on in the controversy -- made it in no uncertain terms.  If the Navy isn't willing to protect Oahu's water supply, the State should take them on in court.  Those tanks are time bombs and the clock is ticking.

There was no active resistance to the draft in 1964-5 when most of us were called in for our physical, no well publicized expose of the war. In fact U.S. soldiers were just advisors in Vietnam. So Trump the pampered son of privilege was too scared and cowardly to join the service. Many were sent to Europe, Japan or Korea.  Many more served their two year hitch in the states. His odds for a duty that might require courage were very low. Still he had to commit fraud to better the odds.  How will this cowardly bully manage the military?  He won't.  No self respecting soldier would follow a cowards orders.  His behavior with regard to the draft is grounds for immediate impeachment if we have the votes.

While on paper we are millionaires and have good incomes, we sure don't feel well off.  I wish that the government would look at it's taxation policy and start taking into account how hard it is for young families to get ahead and still enjoy life.   It seems there is a lot of money / resources directed towards seniors and the ultra-rich, but the middle class (which is still families making $200K+ family income in Vancouver) don't have a lot of focus.  I think we need to investigate removing the capital gain exception on homes, but allowing for mortgage interest deductions on income.  Also, taxing income on couples vs. sole income in keeping with what seniors have would help.  If we don't start focusing on the younger people, we won't have any left in our major centers.

0,"""""Both the Kennedy and Reagan tax cuts increases tax revenues. Period. No lie. It happened."""" . The tax rates were the same on the day that Kennedy died as they were when he entered office. Period. For the rest, you are making classical attribution error. Tax revenues were increasing BEFORE those tax cuts as well. The fact that they continued to rise after the cuts says nothing about any benefits of the tax cuts. The Eisenhower cut from 92% to 90% had no significant effect on the growth rate. The cut under LBJ from 90% to 77% slightly moved the needle. The Reagan cuts actually slowed the growth rate (as well as those for GDP and net private sector jobs). All your argument really shows is that the Reagan tax cuts didn't immediately bring the economy to a screeching halt. Even then, the effect of the first round of Reagan tax cuts was that FY 1983 tax revenues FELL by half a billion dollars.

I also agree that poorer people, too, will have to pay whatever increases occur in the items they purchase. But I also believe that the poor will benefit greatly from the additional support from more wealthy consumers, from the corporations, and from the money leveraged from the federal government. Oregon Health Plan benefits alone are life-changing--way beyond any percentage of the 2.5% tax on the less than 1% of companies registered to do business in Oregon they end up paying. Add to that support for public schools and for senior services and you have a vast advantage for the poor in Measure 97.

The presence or absence of criminal action hangs not on physical fact but on consent or lack thereof.  In such situations, rape kits provide no material evidence.  While DA's are compelled to turn over exculpatory evidence (not that they actually do anyway), they have no particular requirements on how they investigate a case.  Nowhere in the constitution are rape kits mentioned.  Unless legislation has been passed to require a rape kit for every sexual transgression, there is no mandate that one be obtained.   While we as a society should ensure that solid investigation into every rape allegation is conducted, each situation is different and rape kits are not always material in any way.  I suggest that conviction hungry DA's already process rape kits when material.

Donnie Trump admitted to his meeting, and that he emailed an invite to Kushner to meet with a Russian lawyer to get dirt on Clinton, which may or may have been illegal (TBD).  Kushner's failure to disclose foreign contacts on his security clearance application is illegal. His negotiating an arms deal with the Saudis also is questionable.  These are are just samples of many questionable actions that merit investigating. If nothing comes of it, the Trump team is cleared. If there are crimes, they should be held accountable under our nation's laws.

It was necessary to reign in Obama's mad spending spree but as we learned over the past 8 years, central planning stifles growth and hurts the working class.  It's time to take a page out of Reagan's book, slash taxes and grow the economy.  Clinton was able to balance a budget based on the Reagan expansion.  We can do it again with 4-5% growth and, in the near future, begin to pay down debt.

0,"Thanks for the link. I still have enough of the Catholic tradition in me that I can't bring myself to accept the idea of a priest breaking the seal of confession, but I think canon law should require a person who confesses a crime against a child to surrender in order to receive absolution. During the U.S. presidential primary, at one point Donald Trump's marital infidelities and serial sexual offenses were front and center in the campaign. The only surrogate willing to defend him on the Sunday talk shows was Rudy Giuliani, a thrice married Catholic who was also famously unfaithful to his wives. When an interviewer suggested that he might not be the best person to defend Trump given his own cheating, Rudy responded, glibly, that """"everybody does that. I just tell my priest,"""" thus giving credence to one of the most egregious anti-Catholic canards: that confession allows Catholics to keep re-offending. Requiring someone who has harmed a child to surrender would close the revolving door.

A man knocks a woman up , of course he is responsible to pay until the child in 18 . In some states he has to pay until the child finishes college.   My point is , if women really controlled they're body , they wouldn't get PG and wouldn't do what it takes to get PG unless they had protection.  Sure , a man should use protection as well , but the buck stops with the woman. She alone can decide if she wants to get PG or if she wants to kill an innocent nearly born baby. Except in the case of rape. Rapists should be executed . If Planned Parenthood is all women have concerning health care---they are in deep trouble . IF PP really cared about women , they'd stop doing abortions and over night the conflict would be gone towards the use of taxpayer money.

Roger, the stories you find so often against Trump are stories based on Donald's own statements. Every day Trump makes some gigantic blunder with statements that are so bizarre they deserve  to be refuted by the news. He turned two  presidential candidate press conferences into grand-opening ceremonies of his hotel; press conferences that were suppose to be his policy statements.  Then he faults the media for pointing out the press conference was a publicity stunt for his own edification. He made claims about his employees problems with Obamacare where he implied many many of those employees were using the ACA. Almost instantly his own manager pointed out Trump was in error as most, better than 90%, of the employees are given a company sponsored health care insurance.  Many Alaskan's have listened to his messages and found them offensive enough to vote for anyone else.

0,"Gary, The problem with claiming to be exceptional, is too often used as a way to dominate others and to excuse bad behavior on the part of the “exceptional” one. The US is a classic case of this. To be exceptional one should at least behave in a moral way in one’s dealings. The US fails miserably on so many occasions, going back to it’s origination. It talks a good game, but plays another entirely.  “Third is the sense that the United States' history and mission gives it a superiority over other nations.' “  This is the carte blance ticket to evil, this sense that it is superior and hence must dominate. The military’s term is “full spectrum dominance”, and it means it will brook no rivals in any sphere. It’s in the DNA and will likely lead to a global war, probably the final one. I’m sure I’ll get hate for this, but I don’t really care, IMO, the US is the most dangerous nation on the planet precisely because of  this sense of superiority and need to be totally dominant.

0,"Canoutchie, your comment re income from a REIT is erroneous and your comment re income from an income trust is outdated and also erroneous. A significant portion of most REIT's distributions are ROC. This is not subject to tax but rather reduces the ACB. When sold the capital gain arising from the ROC is taxed at 50% of the rate for regular income - so even more tax favourable than dividend income.  Most income trusts that did not convert to a corporation in 2011 changed from paying distributions that were primarily 'other income' to payments that are 100% or close thereto eligible dividends - I would refer to  SRV.UN and KEG.UN as examples.

TABOR requires that any taxes collected ABOVE what is allowed to be spent for the year be returned to the voters.  If the legislature wanted to dedicate 10% of the current approved amount in the budget as defined by TABOR, they would not have to return it to the voters but it could indeed be saved.  If the state collects more in revenue than is alloted for that year, they must either ask permission to keep (spend) the money or they must return it.

In part it is a redistribution of wealth from people who have earned it to people who have not earned it. An income tax means the government decides how much of the fruits of my labor I am allowed to keep. The weaker private property rights are, the less freedom we have. People who have no property rights at all have no freedom at all. The income tax was the 2nd tenant of Marx & Engels “Communist Manifesto”.

Anyone who has been reading newspapers, magazines, watching television, etc., is well aware of how much attitudes towards gender-related issues have changed over the last few decades.  I have personally been struck with how many professional men have neither the time nor the interest to read much more than what they need to read to keep up with their particular specialties, and in whatever leisure time they have, they prefer doing something physical to take their minds off their mentally strenuous work. So they are often woefully unaware of what the rest of society now takes for granted.  This judge's formative years were in South Africa, and as Alceste has pointed out below, his legal experience here did not prepare him for such cases. He has since been given a crash course to update him, and his present position is in another area anyway.

0,"As for me and my house, we will continue to serve the Lord. We are answerable to Creator God if we do not encourage and empower the women in our church families to minister both to their congregation and to the wider community, as He has ordained/blessed/imbued each one with unique talents. Down under, yes SPD, Women's Ministries is alive and well. There is little 'church sanctified ordination' can do to change the direction God is leading, or the abilities He is bestowing on, the majority of members. Nothing, no edicts, decrees, pronouncements, editorials, agendas, authoritative statements, will stop the spreading of the good news that Jesus' sacrifice saves, God loves, God forgives, God wants us to come home. Why, oh why, are some so adamant that the mouth/voice which shares this simple truth, must be equipped/backed-up by male hormones? Brothers and sisters in Jesus - speak to someone today - """"Jesus loves you, He wants you to come home"""".

When looking for employment one must realize that the person hiring them is also simply a person and they'll have their biases whether planted in fact or not.  Combining humanities along with other """"hard"""" studies such as the sciences can beneficial for sure.  I've noticed that with sciences there is more of a rote/regurgitation feature for many, not all, classes resulting in memorization for right/wrong answers on assignments/exams.  Compare this to many humanities being more subjective in nature, ie. you need to prove your point, where one can have the right answer, but if their essays/reports are weakly supported they'll not receive full marks.  A hybrid would be something of a positive note.  Time will tell.

0,"Born and raised in Hawaii, I do find the changing demographics and change in culture to be a little saddening.  A significant amount of people I grew up with, whose roots are in the islands, have left for better opportunities, only to replaced by foreigners or mainland transplants.  When these locals leave, a part of Hawaii leaves with them.  In it's place comes an outsiders perspective and influence that slowly changes local culture.  Kauai has become a vacation/snowbird/retiree mecca, swamping or pushing out locals.  All the new development around Ward caters to outsiders, as does tourism activities, while locals get nothing.  Hawaii was and is special because of the generations of local influences and shaping of it's culture, let's preserve that.

0,"I certainly DO KNOW what Jansenism is.  It is the Catholic version of Calvinism---an almost Puritanical version of Catholicism.  And I am well aware of its tenants.  In fact, a lot of Jansenism crept into the Catholic Church in America  Jansenist spirituality was an attempt to control the human passions through self-denial, mortification and asceticism.  This was essential to Jansenists because they feared that if they could not demonstrate control of the passions, they had not really been chosen by God for salvation after all.  A person predestined to salvation, it was thought, will act in a certain way.  Many priests and nuns coming from Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were trained in the French theology and spirituality method [of Jansenism].  Too many Catholics were taught to be a suffering people, estimating how many days their aches and pains would get them out of Purgatory.  The joy and love of a savior who loves us was missing.

I fear that without these plans and disciplines in place, the success rate would be even lower than it already is for small business survival.

There are many differences between Alaska and all of the other States including that the other States have a more diversified economy than Alaska.

There is no need for an income tax or a sales tax so long as we have a PFD check being issued. The Permanent Fund needs to be used for its intended purpose.  I do not believe we can replace the revenue stream that oil has brought to our State and we should have saved more of that revenue over the last 40 years.  We should not be “diversifying our income stream” by telling people to open up their wallets and pay taxes while continuing to distribute our oil savings income stream in the form of a PFD check. That income stream needs to be used to supplement our budget rather than be gifted away.

Far from a given who are the good and bad guys.  Sadly, policing in Canada is trending towards  the current model of the USA's  Wild West.  There are too (one) many police executions here in Canada.    Demand accountability. Demand it from those in positions of power.  It's the only way to ensure  quality policing.

0,"Rare times indeed when I largely agree with Picard.  Although I will elaborate beyond him on a solution.  School hours of 9-3 are an archaic relic of the past, when moms stayed at home and kids worked the farmers' fields.  It creates a whole childcare crisis.  Most parents work 9-5, plus commute time.  In multi-child homes, losing an income is often cheaper than paying childcare.  There isn't enough time to cram in the curriculum, so PE gets cut, and schools rely on parents to help kids with homework.  The solution is to make school hours 8:30-5:30, with a designated hour of PE and a designated hour for kids to complete assignments - with the teacher there to answer questions - and longer recess and lunch breaks.  The biggest opponent of this is the teachers' unions.  They love their cushy 6 hour days while getting paid for 8.5 hours, on a 10 month year with 3 months vacation time.  It has been shown in Asian countries and some US charter schools this improves outcomes.

Three people I know have converted their rentals into vacation rentals because they can easily get triple to quadruple what they would get for month to month rent from a local tenant.  My tenant approached me about voluntarily increasing his rent since he sees what extortionate rents are going for in this neighborhood and he's worried.   And I suppose it's tempting when instead of getting his $975 per month I could be getting $2400.  On the other hand, he's been a great tenant for 6 years and I feel I owe him my loyalty in return for his.  After all, we have to ask ourselves what kind of city we want to live in?

One idea I've heard is to shorten the state work week (non-emergency, obviously) to four days a week, giving everyone a 10% pay cut for 10% less hours. If people need to then supplement that income with fishing or subsistence, they would have the time to do it. Most employees work a 37.5 hour week. If you cut it down to four 8.5-hour days, that's exactly 10%. I would love someone in the know to do the math on that to see what the savings would be. I have no idea how many non-essential positions we have, but I think most people would rather have a job that doesn't compromise their benefits at a lesser pay than get a straight out pink slip.

It's ironic, though, that both Hillary and Trump represent the same foreign policy extension; while both Trump and Bernie represent the same kinds of manipulative handles on the electoral process, from two very different ends---with bible-thumping Cruz sweeping up the fundamentalists.

I like a representative democracy, where we vote in people to represent us and they make decisions on our behalf.  I feel that the representatives have greater access to more information, and as they are involved in weighing ALL the issues, they have a better sense of how to balance them.  Individuals may be passionate about a certain issue, and they may not be taking into account other seemingly (to them) unrelated issues.   I have a concern that a public vote takes the control out of the hands of the representatives we elected to do this work to govern us.  In issues of economic development, I have a concern that the voting populace will not take the time to educate themselves on the issues enough to make an informed decision.   Note that this is a belief about a system of governance that I know not all share.  I prefer a representative democracy and not direct democracy.

(And Canadian corporations do pay income tax on profits from exports.) Ross, like Ryan, is either deliberately trying to mislead the American public by equating consumption taxes with corporate income taxes, or is ignorant of how both taxes actually work.

FDR warned that the military-industrial corporate takeover of government was the essence of fascism in the 1940's. Today, the media are afraid to use the term """"fascism"""",  warning of """"authoritarianism"""".  I've been saying for a year, a Trump presidency would be a great opportunity for Americans to rise up like they did in the Nixon era (1968-73) and revive what remains of their democracy.  If they don't, they deserve what they get from Trump. But it's always the lower classes that suffer the most when there's a move to the right (The wealthy get stealthy and healthy, the poor get poorer and horror).

0,"Believe it or not, in many of these cases of racist vandalism , were the works of Clintonites. Why would they do this? Probably to grossly exaggerate and create racism when it wasn't there in the first place. Democrats and Clintonites can't survived without creating a racial division. Obama himself admitted in wanting to create a """"browner nation"""". There has been several cases of things like this happening and I believe that in most parts, its an inside job. Muslims are doing it too as this article stated. And its not only blacks or the Muslims. Gay rights people have done this before to advance their cause. Classical case of some woman in the mid-west who claims to be beaten and carved by some conservative thugs, only to be revealed that she did it all to herself. This sort of behavior can only backfire in the long run. If there were a real white racist doing this, it could easily be dismissed by most of the public as another inside job. Classical boy who cries wolf story, isn't it??

And as far as a new vote in Shungnak, according to elections no one voted twice in that race.  So everyone who voted for the legislative candidate voted using the ADL ballot-because there was no candidate on the Republican ballot.  Democrats voted on the ADL ballot, and Republicans exercised their """"right"""" to do the same.  48-2 result. No do-over needed.

When this house of cards starts to collapse, watch the government step in to insulate the precious banks and the real losers will be the customers/taxpayers who will still have no recourse.  Our banks look great because they have no real domestic competition and can use Canadian depositors to subsidize their foreign expansion and capital markets businesses.

0,"In my parish’s RCIA recently, near the celebration of the Baptism of the Lord, we focused on the words of the Father: “This is my beloved child.” I think that is why we baptise infants. It is an opportunity for parents to say “This is my beloved child.” Friends and family gather to say “ THIS is your beloved child.” And with them all, the Father affirms “This is my beloved child.” This provided a basis when we moved on to learning to pray Our Father, for us in our session and for parents with their children. I don’t know if the Church has ever articulated baptism in that way in theology before. Or ever will again. But I think it is the lesson many parents take from the baptism of their child, the joy of friends and family celebrating their child as a child of God.

This onus, however, is an obligation they have to THEMSELVES, and has no bearing on the crime of rape--sex with a person without their consent. The former is a moral obligation to oneself whereas the latter is a legal obligation for all citizens under the explicitly written laws of the United States. Failure to observe the latter obligation can result in felony convictions that lead to extended incarceration.  Your contention that it is """"unfair"""" to blame young/men for """"actions"""" (interesting that's the same euphemism the rapists's dad used in court) committed while drunk is obviously pure bunk but your sympathy for rapists makes you a certain kind of """"softie,"""" Outsider77, doesn't it?

0,"L.L. Raymond - Many Alaskans are already being deeply harmed by Obamacare, which has driven 300% increases in premiums for a large number of Alaskans. Eventually, Obamacare's lack of economic basis will bankrupt the state and individuals who are forced to purchase insurance they may not even need. Something must be done before the whole ACA system comes crashing down and takes the medical sector of the economy with it. That's a given. That's a known. That's non-debatable.  This latest proposed bill won't fix the ACA. It ignores economic realities of its own in an attempt to keep what some people like about Obamacare while only tweaking what some people truly hate about it. But it might reduce the harm and slow the inevitable crash so that there might be time to actually fix it before it crashes one-fifth of the US economy (meaning it will crash the whole of the US economy).  But, hey, just keep hanging onto the pipe dream and eventually reality will smack you in the economic face.

At some point, one party or the other decides that the situation is no longer profitable and they cease operations.  And what did the owners in the lower 48 do to earn the oil they own? Some ancestor homesteading the land four generations earlier? They happened to be sitting on the land when an oil prospector came along and sunk a well and found oil? Sounds a lot like luck to me.

Maybe the markets will slow down. Or maybe not. It may take many years before interest rates rise quite significantly.

The Arabs conquered North Africa and did not learn any of the Berber or Amazigh languages; the Berbers are (and sill are) the indigenous people in North Africa.  It has been a constant in the history of peoples that the strong, the conquerors, the invaders impose their language and religion. It has been so for all people, not only for Europeans that you dislike so much.

0,"Just so we don't forget where this point of view comes from. https://www.manningcentre.ca/about Based in Calgary, the Manning Centre was founded in 2005 to support conservative and libertarian activists and ideas in Canada. Named after its founder, Preston Manning, the Manning Centre is an independent organization that believes in a limited role for government in our lives.  This is part of an anti-government lobby that has been operating in Canada and the US for decades. This ideology brought deregulation of the financial sector in the US (among many other things) that culminated in the 2008 financial meltdown and ownership and control of the world's wealth by the 1% - corporate elites.

1,"It's flagrantly ridiculous, and easy to refute.  First, note that the speech was made to the Nasser-era Egyptian parliament.  He blames Israel for a ludicrous claim of Arabs having to spend on their military (to make good the threat to destroy Israel, I suppose).  No doubt the so-called refugees can join the ethnic Germans of East Prussia, the Sudentenland, the former Yugoslavia as the victims of the losing side in history.  They're only two years apart in time.  Except, the vast majority ran off for an anticipated couple weeks - expecting their Arab colleagues to win the 1948 Israeli War of Independence and get rid of the Jews.  Well, too bad, the """"refugees"""" slipped on banana peel of history and fell on their butts.  And their Arab brothers (except King Abdullah of Jordan) didn't welcome them in their own countries.  Incidentally, until the British Mandate in 1921 (and long thereafter) they weren't """"Palestinians"""" but Arabs undifferentiated from other Arabs of the Ottoman Empire.

We did have 10 years of Judicial Reviews related to clerical paedophelia and episcopal cover-up of same. In the meantime the credibility of the bishops and the Vatican hit zero.

In this instance he is stating his belief but it is not a comment on democracy.  Democracy won in this election.  He just didn't like the outcome and wants to find the boogeyman to blame (in this case the Russians) when in fact, he and other democrats should be looking within and realize they had an unpopular candidate who did not represent enough of the people to get elected.  They have written off the white middle class in favor of identify politics and it didn't work.  So with all due respect to Mr. Lewis, this is his opinion.  It is not about democracy.

There are 1.35 Million civil servants in Ontar-i-owe and when you add all of their friends and so-called working families together, that's the balance of power. Ontario has literally been HI-JACKED by it's own civil servants, and they continue to vote the liberals back in, to feather-nest. It's shameless, disgusting and unsustainable financially and should have never been allowed to happen. Back in the 50's civil servants could not vote, I think it's time we had another look at that policy.  In order to regain the province back, i.e. wrestle it back from the civil service. They should NEVER have been allowed to vote in conflict of interest elections to begin with, this must be a cornerstone of election reform legislation, including Legislative Power to the Auditor General and effective and Strong Recall Legislation.

As discussed above, regardless of whether the law permitted the general counsel’s office to take custody of a student’s (counseling) file, (Kerr) had an independent, primarily ethical obligation under (professional ethical standards) to protect the student’s confidential information.""""  The board appears to be saying that the obligation of professional ethics is a higher duty than obedience to the law.  That may be a moral truth, but the board itself, by fining Ms. Kerr, is exercising authority that is has ONLY because it is acting under authority of law.  The board has no inherent """"professional"""" authority to fine people; that authority comes from its status as a state agency.  Good luck sorting this one out.

So why pass more laws, when agencies are not enforcing existing law? 2. Mental health needs to be a major area of focus. James Holmes was obviously suffering from mental illness, was seeing a therapist, yet fell through the cracks. Paying lip service to mental health is politicaly expedient bull feces. Requiring mental health professionals to notify law enforcement when patients exhibit delusional tendancies and entertain fantasies of violence is a dicey step, but without pertinent information law enforcement is blinded to sick people.

In most provinces such reductions are subject to the consent of the regulator.  The ironic part is that many of the unions that are members of the CLC are actively lobbying governments to introduce legislation recognizing them as target benefit plans and removing the requirement for consent to reduce benefits.  Mr. Hussan should recognize that the government is only introducing a concept that many of his own constituents both support and are actively lobbying for.

The Ravens serve a great if troubled Democratic city; the Colts have moved to a GOP state, once governed by a homophobic ultra-Catholic (i.e. taking the worst of right-wing Catholicism with him as he chose the company of evangelical extremists, now playing a Machiavellian game in DC), even if their city is a Dem stronghold. Those matters alone might matter to Catholics, as Catholics. Then, the name of the one is inspired by a brutal, competitive business, so-called sport, based on animal abuse, the other by the poetry of a distinguished US writer. And since competitiveness is the root of all moral evil, one may mention that the men called Colts and Ravens are just overpaid mercenaries good at pointless competition. These are all great moral/ethical issues that might engage any Catholic. Or have they no place in your Catholic ghetto?

No gay person can believe in religion. Women were held down until 40 years ago largely by religion. Look what happened to Israel and the Jews when they turned fanatically Zionist. The most common cause of wars throughout history are religions. How can Muslims possibly relate to democracy. Almost impossible.Look how divided and barbaric they are in the Middle East. Religion is absolutist, hierarchical, and phantastical; democracy is relative, inclusive, and scientific. One contradicts the other. religions have been used by kings, empires and imperialist invaders to pacify entire populations. On and on...

So we can populate """"remote"""" areas that need people (Timmins, Northern Ontario, Manitoba, Sask, etc.).  This will help with population distribution, as well as more properly integrating new-comers in smaller communities.  There is both a supply and demand problem with real estate.  This can help with the demand side, and help alleviate some of Canada's other problems at the same time.  This is not a big price for immigrants to pay to live in the best country in the world.

Expanded Medicaid would largely be covered by that federal program under the ACA. Republicans want to kill Medicaid. Shift your focus to where it belongs, Congressional Republicans. Or do you want to return to the yearly double digit inflation of health care premiums before the ACA, only a lot worse, with people with cancer being cut off from insurance, going bankrupt, losing their houses, and dying at public expense?

The wife and children should get a couple million at least.  Heck, a couple of days ago, some dude was sentenced to 20 years for touching some boys.  That's 2 million dollars in taxpayer cost to compensate.  In the Finicum case, men shot and killed a man, the family will be far more devastated than in the touching case.  There is dispute over whether police could have avoided killing Finicum.  Irrelevant, that they killed him is not in question.  The killing was for the public good.  Actions taken for the public good have cost.  The family should be compensated for their loss supporting the public good. If it was standard process to compensate family several million dollars from the police budget consequent to every police killing, suddenly we would see police tactics tilt toward preserving life.

If donald/republicans try to help it succeed, it'll get better. Working together is becoming a foreign idea and no longer something the parties look to try and do.

0,"Yes, it was a good month for exports but let’s keep things in perspective. As Dave notes, a big part of the increase in volumes was due to big exports of softwood lumber to get in under the deadline for countervailing duties that kicked in at the end of the month. There was a 2.0% increase in April, up from a 1.8% increase in March based on StatCan’s so-called chained 2007 estimates. To say this is likely to reverse is an understatement, since not only will the increase due to evading the duties be reversed, but our exports will suffer a big drop due to the duties themselves.

Everything reported in so called mainstream media is distorted and slanted against the Trump Administration. Just like when we have a mass murder in Las Vegas the 1st thing the Democrats do is to politicize the situation and begin yet another assault on gun ownership and the 2nd Amendment. Democrats have polarized this country with their never ending assault on American values and rights. Gay marriage, trannies, abortion, false racism,  Socialized medicine, globalism over patriotism, open borders, environmental extremeism, increased welfare, and demonization of White America. These are what the Democratic Party stands for. Democrats are Communists and Bernie Sanders even admits he is one. Anti American values and insanity run rampant through the Democratic Party. America has eoken up to the Communist values of Democrats and the elections in 2018 will show just how reviled theh are.

0,"Max, your not wrong, however something that Bernie has taught me that the system is Rigged to the two main party's and unless we can change it there is no real chance of a third party having a majority for many years to come. As of today,  a third party candidate is not likely to win any major seat in our Federal Government.  My views align with Bernie, the quickest way to change our rigged system is to change it from within the Democratic Party, the longest route to  change is to continue to fight it from the outside the Party.  Strategically it does not make sense to support a third party today.  I am firmly a progressive liberal, and I can't get on board with a candidate that has no real hands on experience within the Political System, given the chaos in our world today, even if I agree with the platform.  It isn't electing the lesser of two evils, it's voting for the best person given our choices, to run the Country and the only one capable right now is Hillary.

The corporate tax rate is 35% and 39% if you include state taxes on average while Canada is 15% and 26.7% if you take the provincial average.  In fact the Nordic Countries which the left love all have lower corporate tax rates than both the US and Canada.  If you want a strong welfare system, you have a high VAT as that is hard to avoid.  The reason Europe has more generous social welfare programs is they have a higher VAT than in North America, not income or corporate taxes.

0,"The European bans on the niqab are a backlash against the increased presence of Muslims across the continent.  Muslims represent a much higher proportion of total immigrants, and immigration has recently been much larger (as a percentage of the population) than in Canada.  And there have been far more incidences of Islamic extremist terrorism than in Canada.  Furthermore, the EU has attempted to force member nations to accept a certain quotas of (heavily Muslim) immigrants, leading to outrage, nationalism, and calls for greater national sovereignty.  My view is that the bans on the Nicaq etc are more of a symbolic protest against all of the above real objections to face covering.  In this context, the reactions are more understandable.  But this does not make them right.

In both cases, the vast majority of ppl flooding the courts or paying huge fines the city knows they can't afford to fight, are all minor offenders. The reckless drivers who go 120 in residential areas, think traffic lights are optional, who's blood alcohol levels are triple the limit, or all of the above; These are the ones police don't catch and eventually cause major accidents.  It's easier and more lucrative for police and their quotas to focus on making the highest number of arrests. Instead of hiding behind dark corners like highwaymen thieves, we could give them the technology and incentives to arrest reckless drivers. Automated traffic sensors/cameras could easily be integrated to alert nearby cops of reckless driving.  0.05 would likely have an opposite effect on ppl where some might take more chances knowing they'll be over limit anyway...

So, what we need to know is the cost to the employer of all benefits, pensions, vacation and statutory holidays, etc.  their employees receive.  In the private sector this has, at times, been valued at 20% of a person's salary.  I would expect this number could be even higher in the public sector - perhaps as high as 30% or more.  Finally,of course we would need to know how many hours a person works on a regular/normal work schedule.  After that it is simple arithmetic to determine an hourly wage.  Then we would really see who the wealthy ones are.  The one missing factor is how does one establish the value of the jobs created by the self-employed folks Gerry is targeting.

Anybody that would beat their own mother up is not acceptable  in my book Jack.   But I don't approve of your judgment of me or other Trump supporters. Not a single person I know approved of the march in Charlottesville  let alone  the vile murder that was committed there. All these groups have one common denominator, hate.  They talk peace and tolerance for themselves  but they won't show   tolerance for anyone else.. Blatant hypocrisy is the worst kind as it's so obvious you can't simply  not see it. . Your opinion, such as it is, is wrong. And I suppose  it's a persons right to hate but  when the  'haters'  break our  laws they will pay. On both sides.  It's fair and it's right and it is the American way!

With interest rates at an all-time low, these assets are just what the 1% want, they want an assured revenue stream - what is the government to do with the money they raise from the sale - squander it and then we are left with nothing to show for the sale. Maybe we can sell the whole country to the Chinese - for a tub of USD. Would that make CD Howe happy?

0,"The Franciscan theologian and spiritual writer Richard Rohr has this to say and I see it as what lies at the heart of Abp. Chaput's """"view"""" of  HIS church. He would neither read nor agree with Richard Rohr. Spiritual blinders are tragic... so are shepherds who don't smell like their sheep! The “Christ Mystery” is much bigger than Christianity as an organized religion. If we don’t understand this, Christians will have little ability to make friends with, build bridges to, understand, or respect other religions or the planet. Jesus did not come to create a country club or a tribe of people who could say, “We’re in and you’re out. We’ve got the truth and you don’t.” Jesus came to reveal something that was true everywhere, for everyone, and all the time. Many Catholics have a very limited understanding of Jesus’ historical or social message, and almost no understanding of the Cosmic Christ—even though it is taught clearly in Scripture (see John 1, Colossians 1, Ephesians 1, 1 John 1, )

We are more than flesh and blood we all have a divine spark one of God’s Spirit (Truth) within us “God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth."""" You say “It (ego) is not in and of itself capable of meaningful rejection of its ultimate creator or the Ground of its Being” The divine spark (Consciousness /freewill) within all human ‘Beings’ can separate itself from its Creator by rejecting Him, and we do this when we reject the essence of His Love which is Truth. “He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him--the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day”  kevin your brother In Christ

0,"The inquiry was an election promise, but it was never really clear and still isn't what the goal was. In the case of the murdered women over 80 per cent have been solved,and like any other murders, the answers are there. The missing women are a different story. Every year thousands of people go missing, both aboriginal and non-aboriginal, and most eventually are located or at least get in touch with someone. But many do not for any number of reasons, most often they don't want to be found and return to their former life. It's not clear what the inquiry could do about this, as there are no answers only speculation.There was never a promise that there would be ground breaking results from this inquiry, nor was there any mechanism that could somehow provide answers to individual questions by those who participated in the hearings. Yet somehow an expectation developed whether well founded or not, and as result the inquiry is seen as not living up to expectations. An impossible situation.

The National Popular Vote bill is 61% of the way to guaranteeing the majority of Electoral College votes and the presidency in 2020 to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in the country, by changing state winner-take-all laws  (not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, but later enacted by 48 states), without changing anything in the Constitution, using the built-in method that the Constitution provides for states to make changes.  All voters would be valued equally in presidential elections, no matter where they live. Candidates, as in other elections, would allocate their time, money, polling, organizing, and ad buys roughly in proportion to the population  Every vote, everywhere, for every candidate, would be politically relevant and equal in every presidential election.

My first residence here was in East Anchorage; it was a good neighborhood when I left in te early '80s and I didn't realize how much things had changed.   On garbage day, there was trash everywhere; open cans, torn open bags, ravens, bears, dogs, probably human scavengers too, but I never saw those.  We went through this in Juneau in the '80s and '90s; doing anything about it was going to be the end of the world and women and children would suffer most.   The only place we required bear-proof equipment was in public areas and commericial establishments.   Residential customers simply had to keep their garbage inside until 4 AM on pick up day; you could use regular containers though most people in JNU used bungee cords on the lids because of the ravens.   Threre were some slow learner and a few fines, but before long, we ddn't have a bear problem.

It started out as trade group like the G7. Since expanded to include military security, intelligence, monetary policy coordination (meaning get rid of the U.S dollar). SCO now covers all major states in Asia with India and Pakistan just joined. SCO is Sino-Russia version of G7+NATO, with population a few times bigger, military power bigger, but economic power less. SCO is bound by treaty and cannot be cancelled with a change of leaders. It glues the strategic alliance of China, Russia, India with smaller states in-between. So you think the U.S. will break up SCO?

0,"I understand the need for quality control in the materials used for Holy Communion. We should have some reasonable expectations that bread is bread and wine is wine, without any extraneous additives.  That said, this is one of those times when the letter of the law might be overriding the spirit. Jesus used the bread and wine at hand when he instituted the Eucharist. It was  probably provided by the innkeeper who rented out the 'upper room,' and I doubt he first did a chemical analysis of the product.  But the greater point is that Jesus used common elements. Wheat-based bread and grape-based wine were staples in first century Palestine, but does that mean that for all times and in all places only those materials should be used? I think that's worth discussion.

The strict regulations the Liberals are working on, with accompanying high retail product cost, will allow the black market to thrive.

The PC police, using today attitudes/thinking to measure people/events in the past, is so insufferably condescending, calling people racist/bigot/anti-XXXX on a whim. This may be one of the reasons some Americans voted for Trump, out of spite (in their mind, of those condescending snobs) if you will, and still continue to support him no matter what. His base of about 35% voters can't be all racists/bigots (only a tiny % are), but they sure feel snubbed by the lefts who think they hold moral high ground and are more superior rather than listen to their legitimate concerns. These kind of attitudes on both sides sure don't make friends or build bridges. They will continue to talk past each other and the country division will deepen.

0,"Hello agordo - Thank you for providing the link. People still have to provide a 10% down payment from their savings and are not borrowing this amount when purchasing a home. """"The practice has grown fast because it allows borrowers to make down payments of just 10 per cent, dodging federal rules that require either 20 or 35 per cent down on mortgages not backed by government insurance, according to industry experts."""" - A quote taken directly from the article.  Granted using one of the 'bundled' loans allows people to skirt purchasing mortgage insurance but they are not funding 100% of the mortgage using financing as Waterfront10 and others have stated. Also, the primary lender, who I care about, gets paid first in the event of a foreclosure. Finally, as I stated above, the primary lender has to take into account the other debt when determining how much of a loan a person qualifies for. This means that the person will likely not be able to afford as much home as they otherwise would.

Trudeau states proportional representation is the 'wrong way to go'-obviously the charade of cross-country consultations with Canadians was exactly that-a charade. He had no intention of listening to what the population wanted. All Trudeau & Liberals were willing to accept was preferential ballot to ensure Liberals always held balance of power.

The constitution of the UK, in fact, is largely embodied in such conventions (which slowly are recognized by the courts as evolving to meet social, economic and political evolution) while jurists and legal scholars in the US strenuously debate the extent by which evolving convention supersedes the US's written constitution.  In Canada, courts and scholars are influenced by US trends (and those in western Europe) but give implicit primacy to the English tradition of looking to conventions when interpreting the Canadian constitution.

So Jesus meant that controlling the god is not the purpose of prayer. The next verse is 'Your Abba knows what you need even before you ask,' so no need to ask. Then the text has the Our Father which is not necessarily a prayer of petition. How could it be if Jesus has just said no need to ask. Rather think of exclamations.  """"!!! You give us each day our daily bread !!!"""" Not a petition. Not trying to control the god.

0,"Taxpayers should not be on the hook for PERA if it does fail, especially since the taxpayers have no say in the people making the decisions at PERA. If their liabilities become so underfunded as to collapse because of their investments and returns, so be it. Many municipal public pension funds are way underfunded as well, many are such a liability to the municipalities, as to strap them into going darn near bankrupt in economic downturns. Another recession like the last one would force many cities to either shed those liabilities totally, or severely reduce benefits, (which here PERA recipients won't accept), or raise taxes on the people to record levels that would virtually kill those cities.  PERA needs to face reality just like the private sector. GM and many huge pension funds are underfunded, they made forced cuts in benefits in the last recession. Since taxpayers have  no say in the investments or cuts at PERA, let PERA stand on it's own, no taxpayer liability if they fail.

Admittedly, the Pope, presumed to be a proponent of modifying the rules, refused to close the door altogether, leaving a minute, if unreliable opening (not to be accepted worldwide--as you conjecture...correctly, I gather).  But the thing of it is, it's an attempted compromise, by the Holy Father, following the Synod.  The problem with the Gang of Four is that they're attempting to slam the door on the Holy Father's foot, from where I stand, and are doing it not by simply filing dubia (to which they're entirely entitled), but by going to the press.

Until an effective non-lethal means of protection becomes available, the public should be warned bear spray is not yet it. (was it Larry Kaniut's idea referred to on a bear attack forum where flare guns have been used effectively [though only about 4 cases]?)  This attack of an outdoors university professor could have been Chris Morgan of WWU in Bellingham. Morgan is an ecology professor affiliated with National Geographic and bear documentaries, but advises people to use bear spray. With the reintroduction of grizzlies into the Cascades proposed for nest year, and with Hilary Clinton likely to win, it's almost certain they will be reintroduced.

0,"Thank you also, Dennis, for your response above.   Sounds like you are a wonderful student, and a reliable classmate!  And it appears, at least to me, that you're getting a good grasp on what EQUITY is all about.  Our British forebears were instrumental in establishing a court system which mitigated the frequently harsh application of the law, which is why, even today, we speak of PRINCIPLES of equity which would, among other things, prevent a plaintiff, in a law court, from being unjustly enriched by a law court.  Plaintiffs in chancery courts are still called """"petitioners,"""" and His Majesty the King appointed his chancellor to oversee, preside and tweak as necessary.  Hence the name chancery courts.  Because certain nobles feared that the chancellor was acquiring too much power, the courts of law and equity were ultimately combined.

But if Alaskans protect their dividend now, they will continue in the future as they always have--with little erosion from inflation. We just lost 50% to Governor Walker!

The author's narrative fits equally well upon Canada: The tobacco growers of Ontario, the cigarette manufacturers here, the stores selling the boxes of them.

My concern is that if Hillary had won as expected, I am positive that he would have backed any and all of her promised anti-fracking measures as he has been a rubber stamp for Harry Reid repeatedly.  But I admit it is no fair to condemn him on votes he hasn't taken.  The Senate wasn't allowed to vote on the merits of the Iran Deal because Senator Bennet VOTED to sustain the filibuster which prevented an open discussion and an up-or-down vote on Obama's reckless unverifiable deal with Iran. He thus voted not to block the deal.  http://graphics.wsj.com/table/IranDealWhipList_0815  Obviously all you need to know about the ACA is that without massive governmental subsidies it doesn't float.

They are focused on helping victims and their families to cope with what happened to them. SNAP is doing for victims, what we Catholics would have assumed that the Church leaders would be doing, that is, protecting the innocence of children and vulnerable adults from sexual abuse and rape. It is shocking for me to have to admit that the pope and bishops are still ignoring the command of Jesus to protect the innocence of children. All I can conclude is that Gretchen does not realize the shame and shock that victims have experienced from clergy that have no conscience about their own crimes against children and vulnerable adults. It is very hard to talk about to anyone since the Church leaders keep denying that it is true. The Church is full of liturgy, where is its integrity?

0,"Pretty much. Especially when many (most?) shareholders are going to only be paying capital gains taxes of only 15%. So its not like you are going to recoup anything at the individual level. I get why people would want corporate taxes down, because it may create a couple extra net jobs, or may make their retirement go up, but they'll likely come out net losers, because the mega rich are going to reap the lion's share of the gains. However, I disagree about the recovery, giving all credit to Obama. I don't think Obama gets enough credit for how he managed the 2008 crash, but these gains are purely based on two things: perception of decreased regulation, and anticipation of tax breaks. And the regulation only provides extra cash for the companies because they can shift the responsibility of negative externalities onto the government. Reduce taxes, allow them to create externality, then have the government (with less budget post-tax cut) clean up the mess. Nasty death spiral.

By openly urging the Russians to interfere and undermine his Democratic rival during the election and by selecting key advisers and cabinet level officials who have close personal and financial relationships with Russian leaders in banking, finance and government, he may be approaching the legal definition of treason as defined by U.S. federal law.

Why say anything to the media at this point with how bad the season is? I don't think it serves a positive purpose.  And my other issue is accountability for the coaches. The players may not be executing properly on some plays or hustling as hard as they could be, but I still believe that the Ducks do not have enough FBS quality play-makers on defense, and so it really doesn't matter what their scheme or game-plan is, because they simply lack the talent to be effective. One of my favorite quotes is by Bill Parcels, who said """"you are what your record says you are"""". The Ducks are a 2-5 team.

0,"I think you need to look much broader than ROIs of green roofs alone.  The negative effect on housing affordability will mostly be attributed to constricting housing construction and making so only high-end luxury housing is cost-effective to build. To put it simply and quickly, any sort of restriction on what can be built or any added cost has the effect of reducing construction and thus housing supply.  This is the main driver of unaffordable housing. Cities like San Francisco and Boulder are great examples of this.  They're cities for the rich white elites and minorities can go live elsewhere and suffer long commutes.  It's indirect segregation.  If you're not familiar with the state of housing construction today, the rising cost of land, labor, materials and regulation has driven the cost of construction up so much that it's almost impossible to build housing which is affordable.  This initiative is just another item on the pile adding to our housing affordability crisis.

When we go back and forth, I feel like we are both just tools of oligarchs. While we squabble, """"left and right"""", money and power keeps getting concentrated into the hands of a few. By his actions, and that of Republicans in  Congress, the President and his cronies are all about the concentration of wealth. It is my patriotic duty to speak out.

0,"Good post but I disagree with your desire for a public apology from each of the Prime Ministers.     We live in a Parliamentary Democracy, so any decision is not made by one person.     Yes, the PM has a huge influence (eg:  in the case of Harper is was virtually a Govt of One) but every MP has a vote and a say (technically).  Khadr received an apology on behalf of the Canadian Govt and it's the Canadian Govt (not one person) that messed up here (repeatedly).     So I see no need for any personal apology from any of the PM's involved.   If they want to make an apology personally and privately face to face - that's their business - but no need to do it officially.

Harper stated: Canada is  “virtually unaffected” by an emerging political division between elite and populist interests. But it’s a mistake to believe that the country is immune, he added. “The reason Canada has not experienced these divisions is really rather simple: in Canada, at least until recently, we had middle class and working class income growth over the past couple of decades,” he said. “Should that change, I predict our politics here will change along the same lines.” Bring on Max !!!

He did so well that it locked Papa Bush as well.  That was a long time ago however... I think our current President has good intentions but has basically given up because of the government grid-lock. If either Trump or Clinton are elected, we will see more grid-lock from the opposing party unless we push the entire RNC/DNC out of office for a term. Doing this would cause the people from the opposing party to backlash where they can.  My thinking is, instead of the predictable Left or Right hook from the people, how about a kick to the groin. Neither the RNC or DNC would see it coming. I think it would send a clear message to our government that the people are tired of the circus show in D.C.  I think we need to remind them who is really in charge. Also, Johnson will push term limits in the senate. No more career politicians!

The woman had peed herself PRIOR to the assault, evidenced by the fact that her pants/underwear was soaked - making it highly unlikely that she was conscious at the time of the assault itself (most people who wet themselves while drunk do so because they are unconscious).  The defense is asking us to believe that this woman peed herself while conscious, consented to a sexual encounter in a way that magically surpassed a severe language barrier, then happened to pass out after.

They think it has something to do with those cancer-busting cannabinoids (the ones that we know causes cancer cell death, prevents the cancer from metastasizing).

Even with these three virtues in play, bishops still have the power to judge and negatively impact the lives of LGBT Catholics, while operating in secrecy and lying about their own sexualities.

0,"You're correct that this issue is far more nuanced than ppl often allow for in the gun debate. They simplify it by pointing to simplicities like """"Look at Canada!

When obvious apples-to-oranges comparisons are pointed out, they change the topic and don't address the argument.  If you want to advance the gun control narrative, maybe start by comparing the US to countries with similar rates of gun ownership and cultural norms. Or maybe start by comparing states within the US according to murder rates and the rates of gun ownership.  What you'll find is that there is very little correlation one way or the other... suggesting, perhaps, another root cause of violence other than guns.  The other issue is how often the guns are used to protect life and prevent crime. Low estimates say 150,000 times per year (US DOJ study... look it up).  But that is an inconvenient fact left out by the gun banners.

He had several good games in 2016, and placing the sole blame on him for the Broncos offensive shortcomings indicates a lack of knowledge about football. If the factors that challenged the offense last year are improved, QB play will get better as well.  Trying to develop an elite QB is a challenge, and Lynch's need for playing time is crimped by being on a team that is good enough to win with average QB play. Making the call on him after 1 year is premature. Of the 4 QBs that are truly elite in the NFL, none have been in the league for less than 10 years, and the game is so complex now that it takes a couple years of playing to just be average. Will Lynch develop in to an elite QB? Probably not, it's just statistically unlikely, but unless a team drafts one with measureable tools, it's even less likely.

Nowadays, one has no idea what to expect when going to Mass in a 'Catholic' church for the first time. Like the Anglicans we have become 'High Church', Middle Church and 'Low Church'.

Most cultivators and cannabis traffickers are otherwise law-abiding, non-violent, etc.  As to your question, the black market still controls about 35 per cent of the market in Oregon,  which means the regulated market controls about 65 per cent of the market. In other words, legalization has removed 65 per cent of the criminal element from the market. It's not perfect, but to the extent that the regulated market displaces the unregulated market, things improve. The extent of the displacement depends in part on how reasonable the regulations are and how high the taxes are. See for example tobacco.

I worry somewhat that widespread mocking of his backing down will have the effect of making him double down even harder on stupid positions, since the entirety of his presidency seems to be driven by what cable news is saying about him.  But on the other hand, I certainly don't feel like he deserves widespread praise for backing away from a position which was held out of complete ignorance and incompetence in the first place, so I'm not sure I'd actually prefer any change here.

This intent is hard to prove even wth a recording of the conversation.  Contacting Russia with this request for a secret channel is not very smart because it give the Russians a chance to learn something from us, but also to manipulate information and create questions about Kushner that would hurt his credibility-- for example, if the Russians were to leak and exaggerate what was said that could be a blackmail threat or a weapon to create confusion.

The reasons for adopting such dress (when male muslims do not) is contentious. Obviously sometimes it is forced on the women by male relatives but in many other cases it is embraced by the women themselves and one has to ask why. It is not required by the Quaran -  so why is it adopted  - and outside Saudi Arabia it has only become common in the past 3-4 decades. Is it to to advertise the fact that the person is a muslim and is different from kuffar?  If so then obviously it attracts attention and it is hardly surprising that people notice the difference.

Sadly, Democrats are fine with this because they've calculated that a poor voter i.e. one dependent on welfare and food stamps, is more likely to support them than a voter in the middle class. 1)	Higher Health Care Costs: Everyone who pays attention knows that Obamacare was sold entirely with lies. One of the biggest lies was that Obamacare would reduce the cost of care Obama actually claimed it would cut premiums by 15-20%. This was the middle class death star. In California, costs will be going up 64-146%. 2)	Amnesty For Illegal Aliens: When so many middle class Americans are struggling to find work, it's unconscionable to allow 20 million foreigners who are here illegally to take jobs that would otherwise go to Americans. Democrats don't realize that they drive down wages for Americans who are already employed this hurts poor Americans  CONT'D

0,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I didn't read that we were being forced to watch any Canadian content on Netflix or to even pay directly for them. Netflix has agreed to do more work in Canada, just like they do in Europe or New Zealand. If you have watched any of these shows you know how good they can be, why should Canada be any different?  There is currently an incredible selection to chose from that does not include Canadian or American (yeah, there is some poop from there too) productions. Try the British or Scandinavian crime dramas for example. For total junk try some of the Turkish productions.  And for the commenter who claims they couldn't find anything to watch in a timely manner, try learning how to use the search function properly, there is a boggling amount of content on Netflix Canada. Don't want to watch Canadian content, don't click on it, simple as that.

China has benefited from globalization more than any other country other than the US and it has a powerful interest in keeping it going. Canada should align itself with China for our own economic future. I should point out that China is far less militaristic than the US -it's amazing how distorted Yakabuski's views can be when he looks at the world through US- colored glasses. China is making a genuine effort to get off coal and develop alternative energy. Yes, its reasons are political, but so what? The US is planning to go back on coal. Deal with that. The end of American dominance in the world was always going to happen. Trump is just making it happen faster. Embrace the change and let's work it to our advantage.

0,"This article provides a needed perspective from a correctional officer as to the challenges of the job & internal politics. Correctional officers aren't the only ones to blame & they don't have support they need to do a good job. That said, the many documented abuses in Corrections cannot be laid at the feet of Williams, who thankfully made a start to expose the problems. This was only a start. If ADN hadn't made open records requests of DOC, it all the deaths & abuses would've been swept under the rug.  Now that we know there's a problem, the state must go beyond a changing of the guard to clean up our prisons & ensure prisoners' rights, health, & safety are protected. As a lawyer who represents an inmate who was assaulted & denied humane & adequate medical & mental health treatment, I strongly believe that reform & accountability will only come through sustained public pressure for transparency &  reform, & litigation for prisoners' rights.

0,"IF a pregnant woman shot herself in the head and killed herself, THEN she would be acting on """"her own body"""".  Although, like states wherein a traffic accident results in the death of a pregnant woman, the perpetrator is charged with TWO counts of homicide. By murdering the baby, they are acting upon a separate, unique individual.  That baby has different DNA than the mother.  Therefore, it is a different individual.  And I'm curious as to who appointed Remington as the spokesman for all on this subject.  The fact that the woman has made choice after choice after choice to arrive at the point where she has intercourse and conceives seems to be lost on the pro murder crowd.  At ANY point in a long chain of """"yes"""" decisions made, she could have said """"no"""".  Abortions as a birth control afterthought show the absolute disregard for individual life those women have.  Perhaps it would be best to take a """"progressive"""" stance and sterilize them. No?

0,"An honest critique of your argument might require a more nuanced understanding of the historical timeline and context of events: A preamble, in practice, is typically an ambiguous statement of noble platitudes and banalities chosen more for poetic license than as applicable rule of law.  Modern Americans often roll our eyeballs when we read that Jefferson penned a Declaration of Independence stating “all men are created equal” while his slaves were toiling on his tobacco plantation.  The Constitution was written 136 years before any New Deal redistribution schemes were created; there wasn’t any peacetime federal income tax until after 1916. To say that a 1787 preamble is a blank check to categorize modern entitlement programs as constitutional rights is an absurdity that no credible court would propose.

So he lies and claims he doesn't believe the science, which sounds more legit.  What I don't get is all the """"family values"""" people who are always the first to chime in with """"but what about the children?"""" not caring about climate change now. It's clear to me as a gay person that """"family values"""" only ever meant """"no homo,"""" but still, you'd think that conservatives really would care about the world they're leaving their children. The fact that they elected Trump tells me that they don't give a d*mn because we all knew Trump's plans before the election. Hypocrites all.

1,"Jeff Flake and Bod Corker, are the reasons Donald Trump is President. Both are not fighters. They both support the Trump agenda, because they both were elected on that agenda. As most Republicans in Congress. But Washington Republicans refuse to stand up for themselves against the media and Democrat, they are more comfortable criticizing other Republicans and Republican voters. Has either of these men, stood up against Republicans being called racist, sexist, bigots, and homaphobes. Has either on these men stood up against wanting to kill 100,000 Americans. NO. When the media calls a Republican a name it reflects on Republican votes as well.  So, I will continue to tell these men to not let to door hit them in the rear on their way out.

Meanwhile others see a different future; one where Trump will not be close to winning reelection.

All one has to do is look at the polls, as confusing as they were, to see a swing in the results during the closing days of the campaign.  What changed during those last weeks was not either candidate taking new positions on their ideology.  Both candidates continued to election day to promote the same ideas they spouted for months.  What influenced voters during the end of the campaign was simply an inundation of Wikileaks and a few other revelations, true or false, blasted to the voters.

0,"Duke Charles Martel: 1. Winston Churchill was the PM of Great Britain, as is Theresa May.  I don't think May was partying Saturday night.  2. Whereas Churchill didn't hold any concerts or singalongs (as far as I know) the British were encouraged to celebrate with song, dance and laughter during the  horrors of WW2.  A celebration of community spirit is a time honoured way of dealing with loss, grief and even fear.  Manchester did the right thing - as we all trusted it would.

0,"Seems illegals in the U.S. and the anti-wall people have found a voice in many Canadians.  The reason for this is the sheer joy that problems in the U.S. bring to so many Canadians. Gun control, universal health care and any good economic stats in the monthly reports on the U.S. economy, and of course a better handle on immigration are all items Canadian don't want to see. As has been said many times, these American problems are the Canadian identity.

0,"The Democrats do need more energetic voices, and I'm not sure how that eliminates Sen Warren.

Trump shows signs of taking control of all our institutions.
"
0,"Bikerman; you do realize that the US has not elected their presidents by popular vote for hundreds of years, right? So, the way the candidates campaign is like this. They target the states that they think that they can win in terms of the number of electoral votes that the state will garner. In Hillarys case, she felt that she could virtually bypass Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin as they had almost always been sure Democratic states. She spent little time in those states. She was playing the same Electoral College math strategy that Trump was. Difference was, he campaigned hard in those states right up until the end. He barely set foot in California as he did not see taking those electoral college votes. Clinton won California by around 4 million votes. That is why they have the electoral college....one state cannot negate the other 49. Why is this important?? Because they both knew that the ELECTORAL COLLEGE vote is all that mattered......and she LOST it. Have a good day.

0,"TOO MUCH carbon dioxide is changing the climate.  Those large quantities of carbon dioxide are being produced by human activity, namely the heavy burning of fossil fuels (coal, gasoline, etc.). When it was only a matter of plants consuming CO2 and animals producing CO2 by their respiration, things were in balance.  Once humans had figured out how to control and manage fire, we started producing extra CO2.  For most of human history, the amounts of CO2 produced by human activity were still pretty small.  However, in modern times, we have figured out how to utilize VERY concentrated sources of carbon, namely coal and petroleum, to produce energy.  This results in the release of larger quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere which tends to hold in the heat of the sun and prevent it from radiating back out into space.  This extra heat, in turn, is  changing the climate of the earth, making some areas dryer and less suited to agriculture.
"
0,"No. It's true that SB 21 is flawed, and we're also giving up too much in credits, but no tax regime would do the job at these prices. Many Alaskans are still living under the delusion that production hasn't fallen dramatically ... but it has. The delusion was reinforced by the lucky coincidence of ACES plus historically-high oil prices. We got fat because someone else's steer wandered into our pasture and we slaughtered it.  Oil prices have, in fact, collapsed due to a flooded market, and that combined with our low production is killing us. But even if prices somehow bounce back it'll only delay the inevitable. At some point we're going to have to pay for our own government. You know, like everyone else does.

0,"Addicts would bring their own drugs to the injection site.  I’m pretty sure these drugs had no manufacturing and distribution oversight by the FDA … more likely a Mexican or Columbian drug cartel.  Who knows the purity and potency of the drugs?  The addict could very well be injecting poison. Secondly, a legal issue could be raised about Bellevue hosting an illegal and dangerous “Attractive Nuisance”.  Same legal argument when swimming pool owners do not adequately protect children from drowning via a fence etc.   A drug addict suffers brain injury or dies then sues the city. Does anyone not believe lawyers would take the cases of the addicts?

0,"yes, you are wrong.  a viable world economy is best for America.  even though many manufacturing jobs have been lost to overseas, American is still the greatest economic country in the world.  if the world economy is good, then their citizens can afford American products and services which means more export of good and services to these countries.  on the flip side, cheaper made products mean that more Americans can afford items and services that they might not able to afford.  hence, it works both ways.  losing jobs in the short-term appears bad but in the long run, it really helps the American economy.  can you argue with results?

The Tamils felt discriminated because Sinhala was the only official language, replacing English after Sri lankan independence (similar to the Quebec issue - would you classify that as an ethnic conflict too?).  As for immigration, let's take Italy as an example. It was an emigrants country till late 20th century. It's citizens emigrated to the USA, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, UK, etc. today they are a large recipient of immigrants. Ditto for the Irish, the Brits, the French, etc. London would never be the world's largest international financial center without those immigrants.  Let's take the USA. It is a hyperpower due to its immigration policies. if they had depended on the sons of the soil, they would have been a middling power today.

Call me crazy, but last time I was in DC, I didn't see vagrants handing out on the whitehouse front door either.  Since the typical norm in society is to keep these people off private property and to not allow them to sit in front of our buildings (whether it be a safeway or Trump tower), why is it an issue for a presidential candidate to act within societal norms?

By the end of prohibition there were more drinkers than at the start.  Same trend has occurred with illegal drugs.  When I was growing up pot and a few hallucigens were available but with the war on drugs, Crack and Chrystal meth soon came onto the scene.  As a result there are more drug ealers than ever before.

Russia as the USSR made such good friends with all the other Central European states (former Warsaw Pact members) they could not run to NATO fast enough.  That """"run to NATO"""" is realpolitik: the real consequences (fear, hatred, mistrust, so many others...) due for occupying those countries for nearly 50 years.  As for the Cuba side issue:  USSR could have as many troops as they wanted, but no first-strike nuclear weapons on Cuba - that why it was called the """"Missile Crisis"""", not the """"Invasion Crisis"""".  Finally, as for responding to Article 5, I suppose the only way to find out is for Putin to invade, and take the chance of starting WW3.  You think Latvia is not significant enough for NATO to defend it.  I think Putin would be very unwise to test NATO over something so relatively insignificant as Latvia.  So is Putin a wise leader of Russia, or just a wise guy?

This action was in keeping with eugenics core belief OF DOING HARM to others for community safety and full exploitation of the disabled. Today, Canada only helps hide the full extent of crimes because they are guilty.  BC claims only 200 were sterilized, sure seems low and they destroyed many of the records for fear of the truth being revealed.  Question, how many were killed?

I'm not saying much on this issue of a definitive nature because I don't have a good handle on all the nuanced and legalistic arguments.....what I do think is that many people, even pundits, are either purposely or unintentionally allowing the criminal liability argument and the impeachment support argument to become conflated....which only muddies the water.

In my opinion, the key question is whether or not one can find within the history of liturgy internal principles, inherent guidelines, that can be used as a foundation for moving forward.  One prime example, IMHO, is the core of the what we now call the Liturgy of the Word. From the beginning in Jewish synagogue practice right on thru Trent, including all western and eastern rites, the pattern has been a set of two or three readings separated by psalmody. The purpose of the readings, in the synagogue or Tridentine ritual, has been to nurture our faith on scripture. For that purpose, that people might understand it, it was translated everywhere into the local language until the counter-intuitive concept of """"sacred languages"""" took hold, pretty much universally. That the scripture be addressed to the people in their language is a guiding principle embedded our liturgical history.  Internal principles is the only way to get beyond diverse taste.

The only other crop that is at all likely to have a HT variety developed is wheat, but that's primarily a winter crop, grown when the monarchs are in Mexico.  As for as monoculture is concerned, that's a side effect of farming practices that were standard well before the arrival of GMOs. I agree that monoculture is a potential issue, but the ability to target specific attributes means GMOs provide a mechanism to preemptively increase crop diversity, or even add resistance when a blight appears.

I would offer this perspective as a user of public transit for 30 yrs and observer of train, subway rail, light rail, express bus, etc. As a rider I evaluate daily what is optimal for me, and as an engineer I think about how I would improve the system. To get people out of their cars, transit has to offer cost/time/stress savings. Current transit riders, will  surely take an easier route. People that are on the freeway now, will consider if they improve, (but they are predisposed to drive currently.) The transfer point from one system to another, is a big negative At-grade light rail, with dedicated right-of-way (unshared lane) can offer benefits, but the more the route is mixed with traffic, there is less/no benefit. So a big question is, will an at-grade rail system, with a transfer point, attract current drivers to take transit or will be be mostly for inner urban core.

Pope Benedict might have taken less of a hammering if he simply held bishops accountable and removed bishops who covered up abuse or didn't report it.  Benedict was either unwilling to do so or simply didn't understand that holding bishops accountable was what people wanted.  Patron saints and Masses of Reparation are all well and good---but they are not substantive action.  Changing Canon Law is all well and good, but that is not a substantive action.

Once that is achieved he starts backtracking on a number of high profile faux pas so that people will psychologically conclude that """"he's not that unreasonable"""" or """"I knew he'd listen to reason"""", etc., etc.  Similar to a government projecting a fiscal deficit, low-balling revenues and then surprise! surprise! the deficit isn't that bad or there's even a balanced budget. Suddenly the government goes from goat to hero.

On the other hand, the GOP bill serves only the interests of our nation's wealthiest -- nothing new for today's Republican party, which was once respectable, but no longer.

Charamsa had clearly been living a double life for some time, until his moment of coming out. But his dishonesty was not very """"long term"""", as you would know if you had troubled to read his account. And 'Yes', his coming out did indeed make him honest, although there was nothing """"magical"""" about it. Betty Clermont's comment was accurate, inasmuch as Charamsa was indeed fired for his 'coming out' statement. Your own comment criticising her alleged 'inaccuracy' was, therefore, incorrect - as was your further claim that Charamsa had written a letter of resignation. There was no such letter.

No existing home-owner would ever want to see the value of his/her home eroded through government intervention. And there are a lot of existing home-owners in the GTA. If they see the Ontario government doing anything that reduces the value of their biggest asset, they are going to react very, very badly. There is an election coming up next year, and the Ontario Liberals don't exactly have popularity to spare. Let the market decide. Nothing good ever comes out of government interventions.

Plus, he was given only a verbal description of a few of the photos on Ratigan's laptop computer, but he never saw the actual photos. In fact, nobody in law enforcement ever did. Why? Because Bishop Finn turned the laptop over to Ratigan's family, after which it disappeared.  I could go on about how the diocesan review board was completely bypassed, about how the principal of the parish school where Ratigan was pastor wrote (a full year before the laptop was discovered) a letter of concern which was ignored, about how Finn sent Ratigan to a therapist of dubious reputation to be """"rehabilitated,"""" etc.  The bottom line is, no reasonable person would say that Bishop Finn acted responsibly or objectively. He was predisposed to save Ratigan's priesthood, and that is never a good thing where suspected predators are concerned.

The quality i.e composition of crude oils vary and is a significant factor in the economics of crude purchasing and refining.The heavy oil produced in Western Canada contains about 35% material that must be processed in a residue processing unit such as a Coker or Residue Processing unit . The refining capacity in Eastern Canada is about 1.1 million barrels with only about  25000 barrels of Coking/residue processing capacity in Ontario vs about 350,000 barrels in the 1.1 million barrels from the Energy East. Significant capital expenditure will be required by the existing refiners to increase processing of Canadian bitumen derived crude so impact of Energy East pipeline on reducing crude imports will be very limited.

If you get in touch with them and explain that you don't know about firearms but you consider it a responsibility to learn about the important cultural issues that are roiling our nation they will be happy to find someone near you that can give you a much needed """"hands on"""" experience with firearms. Explain your theological concerns and that you really would like to deal with someone who can work with your issues in this area. If you are close to the Indiana border I can set you up with someone myself that I know would be perfect to work with you.  I promise you that you won't die from the experience.  It won't compromise your convictions or beliefs in any way to have a practical, physical session in a controlled, protected environment with someone who knows exactly what they are doing. And you'll know more when you finish than when you started.

If someone wants to stand up for Constitutional principles, the restoration of checks and balances to the three branches of government, especially the Executive; fiscal restraint, involving maybe not being the world's policeman for a change and simply defending our borders as the Founders envisioned; and lessening the sheer size of government, I think Margaret Stock is actually the candidate to vote for---An intelligent independent with an impressive resume, who is well-spoken and has something important to say.

The mission of AGDC hasn`t changed from the original intent of ANGDA; get gas to Alaskans and to market.  The letters of interest in Alaska`s gas by AGPA added up to over 5 bcf annually. That was during a gas price spike, but the price has since rebounded back above 8 bucks (was as high as 9 dollars just a few weeks ago on the Asian spot market, and the trend and demand is up looking ahead to 2023-25,..our window for our gas.

With blacks killing one another at record rates, he blames racism.  The breakdown of the black family is a disgrace to our nation.  Unfortunately it can only be solved by honest, well-intentioned black leaders that do not continue to blame whitey for their condition.

Not saying we should have tariffs, just that it's a little more complicated than that and government subsidies come in many forms. What about colleges that put gender studies people into lifetime debt because government subsidized loans drive up the price of tuition. I often see people on these posts that are all for the state investing in the gasline or taking over oil production, outright, and keeping all of the profit.

While Shakhova and Semiletov have retracted their statements regarding a sudden (""""at any time"""") 50 gigaton release of methane, statements made in the video where the blood drained from Shakhova's face in stark horror, the methane is a huge factor in the warming.

0,"Thank you for this article.  As a woman who lives in a family where four generations have experienced sexual assault and harassment over many years, the category rape culture seems apt. Even today with better laws, the challenge of having the perpetrator suffer any punishment/rehabilitation/effective response remains. The assaults on trans and other non-conforming identities are also terrible. It is not all men who do this of course but there is no question that a culture of toxic masculinity exists. I’m a teacher and have great admiration for the young people who are struggling with this issue now. They are not afraid to name injustice. The universities and other institutions need to make their policies more effective. Indigenous women are ten times as likely to be assaulted and the taunts and racist comments happen all the time. The continue here is in the targeting and inhuman treatment that diminishes others in the interest of enhancing ones own sense of power.

Many of them do not believe some of our doctrines, and are even embarrassed by some of them.  But I continue to be puzzled as to why those who don't really believe the pillars of the Advent faith, continue to call themselves Adventists.  I can understand wanting to continue to socialize with friends, but if I didn't believe what the church teaches, I wouldn't call myself an Adventist.  There was a time when we would call these folks backsliders, but back then they usually quit coming to church.  Now, many of them keep coming, but they're not really on board.  As for not sweating the small stuff; who defines what is small?  Any deviation from truth is a step away from the kingdom--and that's a pretty big step.

If you won't do the job and persist in finding weak excuses,  find another line of work.  Baking a cake for a wedding does not endorse the marriage or the couple.  Some hospital recovery room workers who claim to be 'pro life' have refused to even take the vital signs of a patient who has previously had a medically necessary abortion in the OR because of their professed conscience issues.  They were not participating in the actual abortion,  but were still  refusing to monitor vital signs after the fact to be sure the patient was stable.  There was a big legal flap about it a few years back.  It reminds me of archaic legalistic Jewish laws wherein even contact with (touching) someone viewed as spiritually/culturally/physically impure would render one ritually unclean.  We have more than a few nitpicking legalists in religion today. Nuf said.

0,"No doubt the need is there and likely critical.  A shortage of inpatient  psychiatric beds and psychiatrists is a national problem.   For that unit to work properly, that  hospital would need to budget funds likely far in excess of what they initially determined, otherwise it will either be of questionable quality or be closed in short order due to the hit on the bottom line.  Staffing will be key.  They will need to hire clinicians and not just hope those in private practice will admit to the unit and care for the indigent population which will (and should) make up a significant part off the patient population that will access that unit. Psychiatric units are often a significant loss to a hospital's earnings.  That is one of the reasons you do not see a private company operating one in this area.

Use of the CRA Interpretation Bulletin 459 """"Adventure in the Nature of Trade"""" needs to be scrutinized to distinguish what is intended as a short term flip vs. capital intention. (longer term). Investors living outside of Tor or VC do not benefit with double digit annual real estate gains...they use financial investing for which they are rewarded with T5's and T5008's which they pay tax on at their highest marginal rate, which even in good stock market years will reduce their  return and CRA will go after every small T slip missed. Not fair to increase capital gains inclusion rate for long term stock  holders, which Stephen Jaroslawsky says is a tax on inflation. Maybe ALL real estate transactions should be T slipped and reported to CRA.  The rate for flippers should not be 50% but closer to 100% .  CRA offices in TOR and VC should devote more resources here.

A celibate priesthood is a relic of an earlier period where it made perfect sense to a largely uneducated society comfortable with male authoritarian rule of all of their institutions. GenX'ers and millennials learn early from history and current events that such a ruling strategy today is intrinsically harmful (e.g. Hitler, Syria, Russia, North Korea, etc.) and they insist upon diversity at all levels of society.   Jesus' """"Love they neighbor as thyself"""" admonition permeates their worldview but it is a worldview that conflicts with a Church that insists that women are unequal neighbors when it comes to spiritual responsibilities.  Ordination of married men and women won't in itself bring back young people but it could signal a change that may help start reversing the trend.

Name me one thing that Trump has lied about that endangers national security and was being considered for possible indictment on federal charges as Hillary was. The trial about Trump U is a civil, not criminal trial. Nowhere near the same. Tell me when being sued is a criminal matter?

It's like all those American celebs that said they'd move to Canada if Trump won. Did any? No. It's posturing. The UK may lose a few banking jobs, but they stand to gain more by opening to more bilateral free trade with Canada and the US. And what happens if banking contagion spreads out from the sickly Italian and other southern European banks? I'd rather be out of that mess than stuck in some mutual bail in compact with those institutions.  I'm willing to bet in the long run this looks like a smart move. Hitching yourself to North America and Asia seems a lot smarter than hitching yourself to the EU these days.

0,"As any Rockies fan can attest, this franchise has provided some truly breath taking pitching performances throughout the years.  My personal favorite, prior to this weekend, was the Jamie Moyer experiment a few years ago (he of the Stanton gopher ball that knocked out the Miami scoreboard lights, among the many other """"highlights"""" of his time with the Rockies).  However, coming on the heels of the fine eight walk (in 21 batters) effort provided by current number one starter Mr. Chatwood on Saturday, we come to the very definition of what fans have come to expect from Rockies pitching.  In a performance likely not seen since the unfortunate meltdown that ended Rick Ankiel's pitching career, we have Mr. Ottavino's Sunday matinee. Clinging to a two run lead, he uncorks two wild pitches (in a matter of a few seconds) gifting the Dodgers three runs (and perhaps the turning point of the Rockies 2017 season) without even requiring them to put the ball in play.

0,"I see a couple of problems with your plan.  To start with, Pebble contains fairly low grade ore, so tens of billions of tons of ore would need to be relocated for refining - I don't think they will want to be hauling tens of billions of tons of material very far for offsite extraction.  Also, pebble east will be an open pit mine, and about 10 billion tons of overburden needs to be removed and stored locally - I don't think they will be hauling billions of tons of overburden away.  finally, when they are done, they will have a pit 2 miles wide and thousands of feet deep.The extraction chemicals are a big problem, but they are far from the only problem associated with the mine from an environmental standpoint, and hauling billions of tons of ore to an offsite location for refining will never be economically viable.

In neither case is there a clear philosophy. The right-wing populist (and sometimes the fascist -- witness Hitler) comes to power through the democratic process, but once in power undertakes to subvert democracy.

It's evident not only in the birtherism drivel, but in his rhetoric about Muslims, Mexicans, judges, etc. etc. ad nauseam. There was never a legitimate """"debate"""" about Obama's birthplace (or his religion or his education); this was always and only a racist effort to portray him as the """"other"""": not one of """"us""""; not a Christian; not smart; not white.

If you go through property tax records here you find lots of little trusts, like the one set up to buy the condo, that Keoloha stole from. Why have a trust? Except as a tax dodge. Hese records are full of obvious shell companies too. As the Trumps have highlighted these can cover up lots of illegal activities, from tax fraud to money laundering. And the obvious connection, one seldom reported in the press here, is """"cash sales"""". In Miami these are reported monthly. Here seldom. The last one I saw indicated 48 percent of all transactions in a month were cash. That these, possibly illegal activities, are fueling homelessness, impoverishment of the middle class, and least of all the Kealohas theft from relatives,, should motivate serious investigation.

Is there a single line in this publisher-pampered columnist's lament that has not been expressed time and again in the pages and on the screens of the so-called mainstream media? He seems upset that in the debate over climate change people with contrary views also have a voice. Few of these people - many of them young or with young children - will be unaware of our dependence on oil, gas and coal or are so naive as to believe transition to alternatives will be anything but a multi-generational challenge.  But they may not be so persuaded by the fact that Canada emits only a small percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions. They may feel that doing nothing is  an inadequate response to a crisis, and to lead by example is an essential first step. They may also suspect that a gentleman who has made many millions of dollars in the oil-and-gas industry is unlikely to have many answers with which to address their concerns.

0,"Actually, a lot of Christian schools are very intolerant of others who oppose their view. Then about bilingual ridicule, You need to look no further than GW Bush who ridiculed John Kerry because he spoke French. Many of his supporters thus adopted that view.  A lot of Americans state that they don't need to learn another language, that everyone should speak American, even though they think that what they speak is English. They even demand it when they go to a foreign country. Islam, now that is another story. If they only read their own Quran they would have an awakening. Problem is that many people who follow Islam cannot read or write in their own language. They are told what is in their book, therefore outfits such as Isis and its ilk arise. School vouchers equal the dumbing down of America.

0,"1)  We live in a country where there is separation of Church and State.  It is this separation that allowed the Catholic Church to grow and flourish when it was very much a minority religion.  It seems grossly unjust to decide that Catholics no longer want the separation, once they have been able to grow big enough to bully others. 2)  Evangelizing and forcing others to adhere to Catholic doctrine are two different things.   If Catholics were so successful in evangelization that everyone in this country became Catholic -- that would be one thing. But we are nowhere close.  The Catholic Church is actually losing faithful, so I don't see this happening soon.  . 3) The Catholic Church supports freedom of religion and agrees that there is more than one way to God.  So, why would Catholics want to impose their beliefs on others?

What I can't stand is the hypocrisy of pretending his uncharitable behavior either doesn't exist or is justifiable.

0,"The media, financial industry, anyone deriving income from real estate , and politicians will always seek to increase the population, for obviously self serving reason; more money, and more people to tax.  But the poor, working and middle class, including upper middle class, will see their respective quality of life decline.  There are numerous neighbourhoods in cities, say in Toronto, where a middle class person used to be able to live, and now has to live far outside of the city and commute an hour or more, just to have a reasonably nice home.  IF anyone thinks that an increase in the population is the answer, just look to countries such as India.  Want to be a middle class person in India, and live their middle class lifestyle?  Didn't think so but that is what happens when wealth is taken from the many and channelled to the few.

And as a Graduate of Gutenberg I can with confidence say that despite most students and all the Tutors being christian, they do a really good job of leaving Christianity out of most of the discussions.  The first goal for them when reading a book is to understand what the author is trying to say, using the book we are reading and the context of when and where in history it was written. We know Christianity was not on the table for Aristotle, so why would we discuss Christianity when we are reading The Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle?

I wasn't moved onto my farm 1 week before the Veneta city council expanded their urban growth boundaries, and rezoned my """"farmland"""" to force into development. Then there is Starlie, whose 10 acres of wetlands, aka un-farmable swamp (to be continued)

Also sorry but you don't get it, and your making yourself look extremely ignorant by posting stuff like that. It's not anti-white it's anti white nationalism. Whites haven't been oppressed, whites have oppressed. I find nothing to be proud about being a white person myself.

What you offer is a road for North Korea to have 10 nukes in 2021, 40 nukes in 2031, and 100 nukes in 2041.  I say END the trajectory THIS YEAR. THAT is a solution.  What you are to North Korea is what Chamberlain was to Germany.

0,"Businesses and many conservatives see DACA as benefitting our economy, adding to economic growth and job growth. The Cato Institue is a conservative think tank that has many supporters of Trump. Cato just stated that its economic studies show that abolishing DACA would have a negative $200 Billion impact on the US economy. They note that this is as bad as the cost to cleanup and repair the damage to Houston from Hurricane Harvey. Trump has now made it clear that he supports DACA and the dreamers based on his promises today to the dreamers and Nancy Pelosi.

0,"On the Republicans health bill.  Anyone with common sense would get the idea that the Republicans don't really care for the poor and old people in this country.  Yes, the old and poor need the most help with health care. This bill will be for the rich because if you are rich you can very well afford the cost of it, but if you are poor and especially old, you will have to do without. Many will die because they would rather eat.  The wealthy will benefit the most. Bernie Sanders has it so right. Money has taken over our country. Trump has helped that by hiring only billionaires.  Defense of our country is fine, but spending more for it than taking care of our people is inhumane; and giving tax breaks to the rich is just as bad. Who  cares that Bernie calls himself a socialist; he's not a communist! That's the difference! He's a good man. It is a sorry thing to see our country stoop so low.  Our country would be great again if we had our integrity back.  Judy Gilkerson Sultan,WA

The President is mentioned three times in this editorial and - to date - neither he nor his supporters have been involved in any of this. In fact, most of the anti-semitic acts that have been solved by police have been either fakes or been perpetrated by liberals/Progressives/Democrats and individuals who supported either Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton. In short, this is YOUR side's problem. And it's a problem that doesn't seem likely to be fixed anytime soon given the fact that the Democratic National Committee has selected a notorious anti-Semite to be its deputy chair.

0,"Respectfully CHRISTIAN MANNHOOD, in a world where people say and do many things for many reasons, one thing is clear, accusations are nothing more than accusations, till they are proven. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Clinton have paid off women accusers in the past, and to me that taints them, but they'll say it was less costly. I like this case because it must be proven, even if by a lower means of proof in a civil trial versus a criminal trial, preponderance of the evidence versus beyond a reasonable doubt. There are people, both genders, who seek the rich and powerful for their personal gain as a deep pocket being the motivation for accusation. Also, with men it is much easier for them to be so trapped, which is why I admire Mr. Pence and his manner of carrying himself concerning women outside his marriage. That kind of honor is most rare today. If Mr. Trump is so found at the conclusion of this case, then so be it, he brought it on himself whatever the penalty may be.

0,"The reality is that the runaway housing market is due to the failure of a number of federal institutions, Fintrac, CRA, Immigration Canada and CBSA. Of course, historical low interest rates can take a lot of blame but that is federal monetary policy. The personnel within these organizations failed to do their jobs. Of course, the BC Realtor Association failed to live up to their reporting obligations but we know they have a vested interest in selling homes. Governments at all levels are now in a bind. If they bring the housing market down, many will find themselves underwater leading to a plethora of other problems. The reality is what could the NDP have done, nothing.

This suspect who had  such large amounts of viable evidence is a direct threat to the vulnerable youth of our community. Dealers who are arrested with such high quantities of lethal drugs(, not to mention the illegal firearms) should be prosecuted and held as a high risk to society. Had he molested a child or raped a woman would he be so dismissively released on such low bail? Yet he is a walking manslaughter bomb, praying on our youth. People need to start writing the prosecutors office, because the police and sherriffs departments are making arrests. Clallam co has become a comfortable zone for heroin and meth dealers. It is harming the youth, the mentally ill, and the community

If so, your posturing has had the opposite effect, which is to let others see that you don't know the meaning of the phrase.  In fact, Dr. Krugman posed a direct question.  And the right answer is, that all four candidates are fighting for the votes of a majority of Americans who are ignorant, angrily opposed to educated rationality, unwilling to give up the slightest convenience, outraged to have their responsibility to future generations laid at their feet, and finally, more concerned with making a decent life for themselves in any way they can.

0,"Well, you're right there and I worded that poorly. Regardless, it is in Canadas and even more so US interests to help Mexico develop an economy that retains its citizens instead of seeing them moving across their borders illegally, en masse in search of opportunities. Mexicos economy is growing thanks in no small part to massive investments by major US corporate investments there and it seems a shame to roll it all back just for what? To wall them off and let them fester in poverty? That's no long term solution and walling them off is at best a stop gap measure. Certainly Mexico shares some of the responsibility in developing its own nation but without access to US markets any of their efforts are doomed to failure, just like Canada. Trumps offered plenty of stick but now he should be offering some carrot

0,"The problem is with companies that don't have much feeling for the value of their employees. Then they wonder why they have to spend so much time hiring and training new employees as their turnover rates grow due to poor wages and stifling work environments. When I have had employees, I have paid them far above minimum wage or at union wages as I learned quickly that having happier, long term employees that I could depend on and promote from within saved me a ton of money in the long run over low paid, unhappy short term employees. A sound business plan should include such. Companies that do the bare minimum aren't contributing to the betterment of our community, rather they are part of the problem - and a burden to the taxpayers who have to help subsidize their labor, medical insurance costs, and profits.

0,"2 Be -- Let me assure you -- you need not educate me about refugee resettlement.  I worked for several years with a resettlement agency.  Some of my clients are refugees who file for permanent residence.  I am intimately familiar with the process and the problems caused by the EO. Also, a federal judge recently ordered a stay on parts of that Order, and the 5th Circuit refused to lift that stay. Asylum is an immigration benefit.  I regularly work with people seeking asylum.  Many people who are considered by some to be coming for purely economic reasons are coming here because they fear some sort of persecution.  Unfortunately,  it's very hard to get asylum, so many people do not, although I think many of them should. People in detention centers can certainly file asylum claims.  The problem is that with a difficulty to access legal help, their asylum claims stand little chance.
