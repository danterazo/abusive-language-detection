"
0,"I don't have a problem with politicians who support abortion restrictions entering as Democratic candidates based on their other issues of concern.  However, I would never vote for such a candidate. This is true even though I believe abortion is immoral.  We don't force men to see pictures of kidney needing patients, if they are a possible donor match.  Right-wing fundamentalist states are now putting restrictions on abortion and birth control access so there is reason to attack back as a force for Justice for women, including boycotting a candidate for his stand on this one subject.  This writer is clearly a Pro Life supporter based on his labeling of Pro-choice as Pro-abortion.  The ultra sound issues, though not forced on women in some states are being forced in others, and this strikes many women as a coercion technique and an insult.  Women are aware they can get an ultra sound when ever they want one so no offer need be mandated/regulated.  Assuming women are stupid is an insult.

0,"Republican and proud of Lisa.  If Trump could have come up with something better, he would have.  Instead he failed and now is blaming Congress for trying to come up with a new plan in a matter of days that Lisa and other smart people said 'no' until it can be analyzed. Thankfully leaders like McCain and Murkowski still exist instead of pandering wimps.  Hopefully courage is contagious.

0,"Back in the 70s intimate partner homicide was around 50/50 but since then the rate of women killing their male partners has dropped even more than the rate of men who kill their female partners, to where in the US we're at about 2:1 ratio.  The bigger distinction is that women are so rarely convicted when they kill their husbands and boyfriends. There is a famous feminist law professor in Toronto named Elizabeth Sheehy and her specialty is """"proving"""" that women who shoot their sleeping husbands are always acting in self-defense. All the built-in privilege women have at every stage of the criminal justice system culminates with them being able to literally get away with murder.

0,"Either try harder or stop.  I said """"intelligent, balanced socialism"""" which encompasses the state working with private sector operators when that can be made to work in the best interests of the ultimate owners - the people.
"
0,"Antebellum slavery created an estimated four trillion dollars of wealth that went into the pockets of whites and has been inherited down through the generations. Jim Crow laws denied blacks basic civic opportunities (even remaining alive). The federal government in the post WWII era denied home loans to blacks while making it possible for whites to purchase homes that today are worth millions. These are historical facts, and there are innumerable other examples of the systematic discrimination against blacks and other minorities. So tell me again about our color blind, one race, Homo sapiens society? No one is accusing every white person of being a racist. But identifying the historical legacies of racism is altogether necessary to understand why BLM and other such protests occur. My guess is that you'd be out in the streets yelling too if your country, government, and president made it clear just how much they hate you and want to keep you oppressed for their own aggrandizement.

Quoting from ADN: """"Alaska's major oil producers, ExxonMobil, BP and ConocoPhillips, have board members on Red Cross of Alaska who have provided support and helpful information about the flooding and rescue efforts, Libbrecht said. The parent companies have made significant donations to support response efforts, he added. . ExxonMobil has given $1 million, including $500,000 to the American Red Cross, Libbrecht said. ConocoPhillips has also given $1 million to the American Red Cross. And BP and the BP Foundation is giving $750,000, including $250,000 to the American Red Cross, and is also matching donations from employees."""" .

0,"i fell victim to the hype and went to see it. Blech. Not only did we not enjoy it, for us, the movie was entirely cringeworthy. For the life of me, i can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. The two leads were completely miscast. Why would you take two people who can't sing or dance to star in a musical requiring singing and dancing. And take someone who doesn't know how to play the piano and attempt to teach him to play in a few months?????  Watching him play was worse than getting my teeth cleaned (and that's marathon man torture for me). I totally don't get it. And i don't understand how anyone could have liked it. a very painful two hours in the theater.

0,"Good pickup on Rui's story.  Do exactly what you are doing use professional help and modern techniques.  Exterminate vermin and quarantine the suspected areas.  Get professionals to do the work with protective gear.  Epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists, ER rooms and health care workers need to get immediately involved with potential victims.  State of Hawaii Department of Health needs routine inspections and laboratories should be dissecting vermin for  diseases and fleas until they are satisfied that situation is over.  Totally over.... Educate the citizens and the community. Don't take this lightly.  This is not a joke and must be taken seriously.  Spend the money required.  Do not wait. Then be vigilant and stay on it.  Finally, rats are not hard to kill.  You just have to want to do it. It's a lousy job but it must be done. Rats have very little trouble killing you and no remorse while doing it. Criticize me all you want. I really don't care.  So important.

And the opioid stuff is just dreadful.  I don’t know if it’s true but I heard that a lot of docs with working class patients prescribed opiodes for work related accidents or surgery or whatever as it was cheaper.....these guys got addicted....  Whereas in a more sophisticated milieu, patients got quite a bit of Physical Therapy (more expensive by far but not addictive)  Think we need to look at this issue...if it’s a medical finance question....definitely think we need to get a lot more PT. Further, have heard that once addicted it’s a very long struggle to get clean...many years with help (also expensive) ..I’d be curious to hear from JD Vance (Hillbilly Elegy) on this issue as I think he’s working on it!

0,"I hope Trump does pull us out and not bend to hype and overplay?  Have you noticed the climate people believe that we can control the atmosphere, but don't think we can control our borders?  If Trump pulls us out it will be healthy tone setter.  Where's India and China in this agreement? 2030?  No sacrifice for them until 2030, or something crazy like that.  We need more reasonable and favorable terms.  Trump has far more responsibility at stake than does Pope Francis, who is not a stakeholder.  He has no skin in the game, no employees or citizens who will lose their jobs.  He's merely an advocate without portfolio.
"
0,"BLM are correct about white privilege and one of the salient points they make is that too many whites are blind to their own white privilege.  One of my favorite pointed examples is how white fans of football castigated NFL teams who tried black quarterbacks.  Blacks may have earned their presence at some positions, but God did not endow black athletes with the intelligence and leadership skills to be quarterbacks.  That's lasted as long as white ownership was afraid to sign off on a talented black quarterback.  It isn't true anymore.  No more white quarterback privilege.  The rest of unexamined white privilege will also fall by the wayside.

"
0,"In the zero interest landscape that the FED has fostered, for years, in an unsuccessful attempt to stimulate economic growth, which has only fueled excessive debt and an inflated stock market, pension funds in all states have suffered. In many states, legislators have desperately raided pension funds. Illinois being one of the worst. When the value of money is near zero, it creates risky mal-investments, asset bubbles, and pensions with increasing payouts and declining revenue in dire straights. The present money card game of confidence will some day have to reckon with the immutable laws of math, but until then the fumes of confidence, skewed statistics, and the normalcy bias may take us down the road for years.

0,"I believe in an open, competitive opportunity for everyone.  Nike didn't have to compete fairly with their competition because this was not put through the RFP  process.  Why was this opportunity not put out so minority or woman owned businesses had the chance to make a proposal to the school district to provide the items listed in this contract?  Nike is not the only company who can fulfill the items listed in this contract, they are not """"Sole Source"""" providers.  I don't have a dislike for Mr. Yancey, but he is a public employee who pushed for a contract with a value near $150K without putting it out for competitive bidding.  I see problems with these contracts in the future when parents say """"No"""" to their children being billboards for Nike or any brand label in order to play competitive, amateur school sports offered through their public school district.

0,"In short: unlike his predecessor to the Congressional stand James Comey, AG Jeff Sessions conducted himself without the hyperbole, hysteria and personal bias in his actions and his responses to questions. He talked about evidence-example, the memo that then FBI Director Comey received but denied getting in testimony-as well as his actions well within the DOJ code as well as his position as a member of the President's cabinet. There is no question the Democrats are using the Al Capone method of trying to find a scapegoat. It's sad that they didn't show the same zeal to reopen the case against Hillary Clinton-especially after 30K emails were found on an unsecured laptop owned by known pedophile Anthony Weiner.

Witness the 2016 Presidential election. 1b doesn't apply because the supreme power is vested in the Law of the Land, the Constitution, which can't be changed by a simple majority vote. 2 doesn't apply because our Separation of Powers between the Legislative, Executive, and the Judiciary don't operate by majority rule, but by the Rule of Law.  We are a Republic with a few democratic processes, but most of them aren't.  We don't run this government by mob rule, and trials aren't determined by popular vote.

0,"To the contrary, that is what Disqus attempted to do, rather miserably.  The approach Civil Comments appears to take is two-pronged:  There is an algorithm that attempts to detect certain inherently uncivil posting and filter them without posting.  Those that pass the algorithm post and then are “crowd sourced” to other posters for rating as to civility.  Since this is a new process, it is still a work in progress.  Incivility, as I see it, consists of direct attacks on persons and their beliefs: """"You are a *&^%$"""".  Since this is the National Catholic Reporter, I also rate direct attacks on the Church as uncivil - e.g. referring to a Catholic as a “mackerel snapper”, as well as juvenile attacks on the Church’s hierarchy - e.g. “Bishop so-and-so is a fascist”.  They will respond to reasonable inquiries - “can you give me some insight into why this post: (text quotation) was considered uncivil?”, which is a heck of a lot more than Disqus ever did.

0,"Will there be added dedicated parking for these stations so people can park and ride?  Or will they be parking their cars in existing store parking lots subject to towing?

I imagine the Boeing Plant station will be a destination for many.  Is Boeing contributing anything to this?  Especially land and funding for the station at their location?  Big employers should be required to contribute to mass transit solutions for their workers.  Microsoft set a good example with their Connector service!  w.r.t the 164th street station concern, they need to build the station closer to where the people and the parking will be.  There are new apartment complexes going in nearer to where the alternate suggestion was made and also possible land for a parking garage for a park and ride.

And indeed I would say that was the best argument in favour of the Trudeau Liberal plan vs. what existed under the Harper Conservatives.  Previously we had the Universal Child Care Benefit, the Canada Child Tax Benefit and the National Child Benefit Supplement (plus there was the Child Tax Credit up to 2014, though the Conservatives replaced that with an enhanced UCCB in 2015).  3 different programs with 3 different rules to calculate who got what replaced with 1 program with 1 set of (somewhat complex) rules to figure out who got what, so a slight improvement.  Unfortunately the new program was a lot more expensive than the 3 it replaced, and that extra cost was funded entirely through deficit spending even during a period of global economic strength.

On the other hand, a significant depreciation in average benchmark price would be considered more of a 'slump'.  What we are seeing currently are twofolds.  Firstly, the foreign buyers have left.  Secondly, Canadian buyers have become spectators since the new foreign taxation law was implemented to see how low the price will go.  Demand has gone down, but it is only slightly under par currently with the city's low supply leading to a gentle depreciation in benchmark pricing thus far.  The last 6 months have given us a good idea of what would happen to the benchmark price when demand both domestically and internationally falls off a cliff.  The foreign buyers are gone but the domestic ones will return (give them roughly 6 months).  Expect gentle depreciation for 6 more months (10%-15%) before stabilization.

No- the baker, the photographer, the florist, do NOT have a right to hide behind the false narrative of 'religious freedom' to deny services to the general public.  Odd how the 'Christian' conservatives are so insecure in their beliefs that they must impose their own version of sharia law in our secular nation.  Even Gov Pence was rebuked by his own Republican Statehouse for his repeated attempts to push his small-minded religious bigotry into State policy.  They told him to stand down and shut up.

Militia members, """"...shall within six months thereafter, provide himself..."""" with a musket, bayonet and belt, two spare flints, a cartridge box with 24 bullets, and a knapsack.

So if a number is not a match to other data points then the person  presenting the number needs to contact the SSA to clear up the matter before employment. - If it is found that someone is employed with irregular SSNs or that the employer is not submitting the social security tax for person for whatever reason, then justice demands that the employer be remanded to the justice department and other law agencies for remediation. - Indeed, that businesses and individuals hired people without verifying the social security numbers (in early years this was somewhat difficult) is what created the draw for people looking for an higher standard of living with no regard for labor laws.

Now, high schools can be geared to interest students in IT, but normal high school students will never emerge with skills necessary to do general purpose competitive programming without additional training.  It is misleading to suggest to high school students that they can end their studies at HS level and make big bucks.  As to tech job salaries, the numbers are cooked.  The top jobs earn massive salaries perhaps 5+ times higher than the grunts in the company.  Take the average salary and it is massively distorted upwards.  If you want to tell HS students a more truthful and honest number, give them the median salary of all employees of tech companies.  Moreover, include all tech companies, not just a few cherry picked to produce high salary numbers.  My own high tech manufacturing company (20 employees) has not been surveyed.  Honesty is tough.

And you simply prove how we're going to go on and on and on talking past one another:  You, for example, surely and evidently believe that a life """"lived well and faithfully"""" can include to some degree same gendered sexual/romantic relations, whereas I am going to continue to say that those desires and the actions toward which they are ordered are inherently an indication of the opposite, of NOT living well, nor faithfully.  You mention """"the majority of Catholics in this country,"""" something that to me has no meaning, as I don't see how my belief, or yours, renders something true or your disbelief, or mine, makes something untrue.

There are thousands employed in this Alaska resident dominated industry in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Mat-su and Kenai Peninsula. I wonder if he'd be singing a different tune if he represented a different district? Any cuts to credits should be in sync with any other cuts that would have to be made. This being said, I think around $200 million in cuts is likely fair enough. But we shouldn't kick em(the producers) when they are down, because they probably have to spend 8 or 9 billion dollars to get a mere $7 billion dollars worth of oil...

The real problem is finding a government (pick  colour, same result) that has the intestinal fortitude to purchase the necessary equipment (capital expenditures) that our Armed Forces needs.  As of last week, the Royal Canadian Navy no longer has a destroyer in its inventory. So what you say? This is first time in its history that it hasn't had a destroyer or larger in its inventory. It's kind of a big deal!  The planes that the Air Force use to fight with, while updated, were built in the 1980's. The helicopters that support the Navy were built in the 1950's. Until Afghanistan happened, the tanks that the Army used were built in the 1970's.  The successive government's have all said that they are doing this or doing that, but really they haven't done much.  Until capital expenditures are made, it doesn't really matter what the defence budget is.

I would like a politician who would push heavily for green, fish-friendly energy (no hydro-dams, instead in-river hydro, tidal, wave power in addition to wind, solar and other) to ADD to our current oil and natural gas production. Plus a bullet LNG line to Fairbanks, with a tap to ship gas via barge up and down Yukon River wouldn't hurt. Also to increase fish hatchery use around the state, & to boost all salmon/fish in rivers.  I am tired of Alaska's and the nations leaders seeming stuck in retrograde, trying to drag us back into the past.  Palin is a whole lot of old school thinking, in a closed room with the oil industry.

The brain damage does not suddenly begin in the NFL nor limited only to football.

Sadly, for many of the players noted in this article, the depth of information was not readily known during their playing days.  Yes the equipment is safer, rules are stricter and the standards for being able to re-enter a game are higher...but there will ALWAYS be a danger to participants. Yet it remains a CHOICE. If you do not like the potential consequence of participating in a sport, then do not participate in it. You have now been warned!

At worst, all of the above. Not much to like here.  You can't fix childcare by fiddling with this tax credit, although you can certainly make things worse.  To fix childcare requires holistic tax and policy changes that supports all parents and all kinds of families, and makes it possible for a parent to stay at home at any income range, with as little long term impact as possible.  Increasing gov't revenues is not just the wrong way to look at this issue, it's a thoroughly antithetical approach to childcare and parenting.

We cannot bluff our way into a cheap solution-- we need to offer carrots that help NK and us. No more failed policies.

0,"Yeah, those say what most say, that the harsh decline in native born Canadians and their stated beliefs is being somewhat ameliorated by new immigrants who generally arrive with much stronger degrees of faith, but even those studies and polls generally show the same trends we're seeing here in Canada as those new immigrants acculturate.  Macleans did this piece:  http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/what-canadians-really-believe/  On how the rate of decline has not been as steep as originally though, largely because of immigration, but look at what those poll numbers are showing.   The HIGHEST value, for 18-34 who are recent immigrants, is ... wait for it ... just 43%.  Older immigrants do nothing but decline from that high bar, so the longer they stay in Canada, the lower it gets.  In the end, we don't have a single generation in majority status, and not a single demographic in majority status, even with our most optimistic estimates.  The only variable left is, 'how long'.

The weapons charge was due to a hand gun that was still on the seat of his car after he had been target shooting, that had inadvertently had a coat pushed onto it. The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

DC and Hollywood Liberals are used to ignoring sex crimes. Bill Clinton was a known dirt bag long before becoming President, but he was a rising star in the Democrat party so his crimes were forgiven/forgotten by the Dem elite and their voters. Many have been calling for Hillary, a close friend of Weinstein's who received millions in donations from him, to come out and condemn his actions. She hasn't yet...mostly because sex assault is a """"poor person crime"""" to her, hence the reason she helped cover up Bill's various crimes throughout the 70's and 80's.

Then they shut up. The women who had affairs with Bill Clinton are only brought up by Republicans and conservatives when it's convenient. Otherwise, they are stored back on the shelf. All women should be armed with the knowledge and the legal means to fight back if they are subjected to workplace sexual harassment, regardless of the workplace and regardless of the man's wealth, power, or political connections.

Of the 1880 regular CRC appointments, women represent just under 31% of the total applicants and hold slightly more than 28% of the Chairs, representing at most an 8.5% difference between the expected allocation and the actual.  Not nearly as dire as the inveigled 'gap' between the 31% actual and ~50% female population at large.  Moreover, the CRC's own rules were actually punitive to women by excluding/restricting applicants with CV gaps (maternity leave) and those who'd earned their PhD's more than 10 years prior.   That's the fault of the gov't, not universities.  That the real gap is <10% despite these factors indicates that the environment is far more egalitarian and supportive than the minister claims.

If you want to, many of you complainers can easily cut your cost of living 25%.  My income currently is median, and I live well on 25K/Yr expenditures, saving the rest.  You could do it, too.  All of you.  But, you won't.

Sorry to burst your greasy bubble but opinion polls show a majority of Greater Vancouver citizens oppose the project.  Among other municipal leaders, the Mayors of Vancouver, and Burnaby ( where the terminal in located) oppose the project. The BC gov't, though not opposed, has a very long & stringent list of requirements the project must prove it can meet before the BC gov't will approve it. Two thirds of first nations affected are opposed.  Vancouverites  & BC-ers won't agree to see their city & province  be made a colony of Calgary & its Big Oil masters - no matter what PM Trudeau, or Christy Clark think about it. It's not Calgary's  harbour that's at risk. Albertans don't give a flying****. But BC-ers do. The project's  D.O.A.

Drugs don`t make sense as first-line treatment for the biochemistry of depression.  To treat with drugs before addressing more basic issues is to put the cart before the horse.  It`s optimal to do the adopt: Good nutrition (eat as your great-grandparents did - including organic, grass-fed meat), don`t eat anything with chemicals added (including folic acid added to wheat products), get tested for nutritional deficiencies and address those, and do genetic testing to determine major genetic SNPs that could disrupt metabolism.  In addition, people may need acute treatment, which should include either B-12 (hydroxycobalamin) shots or a combination of methyl and adenosyl (cobalamin).   Methyl clears toxins and supports healthy blood cells while adenosyl strengthens immune and neurological function.

All of those things combined with a terrible 2017 season given VJ's track record (or lack of a track record) is what should give VJ a shorter leash than most rookie coaches.  One thing to keep in mind is we finished 9-7 last year with what were essentially two rookie qbs, a worse oline than this year (if possible), and a SB hangover.  This year we have improved in essentially all accounts, but are on track for a much worse record.  I don't know where else to point the finger than the coaching change.

These effects can last for days or even weeks. During this time, the body is replacing the depleted enzymes in the nervous system so it can function normally again. Exposure to small amounts of chlorpyrifos can cause runny nose, tears, and increased saliva or drooling. People may sweat, and develop headache, nausea, and dizziness. More serious exposures can cause vomiting, abdominal muscle cramps, muscle twitching, tremors and weakness, and loss of coordination. Sometimes people develop diarrhea or blurred or darkened vision. In severe poisoning cases, exposure can lead to unconsciousness, loss of bladder and bowel control, convulsions, difficulty in breathing, and paralysis.""""

Further, a majority of respondents feel that immigrants aren't connected to Canadian society and an even more feel that immigrants need to do more to adapt to Canadian society. The study suggests that while Canadians are more open to immigration from poor countries than are, say, Hungarians, they are less so than are citizens of many other Western countries.  http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/canadians-not-so-exceptional-when-it-comes-to-immigration-and-refugee-views-new-study-finds

Regarding """"the very few cases"""" you've examined, are you suggesting that the victims tried to tell """"parents, doctors, teachers, coaches etc"""" before they told Bishops/Church reps, or those Bishops/reps heard of it? Seems to fly in the face of the general observation that victims generally don't, or didn't tell anyone. The reporting of abuse now has increased since the general population now tend to believe victims, even younger ones, even when cases can't actually be proven. And what kind of proof do you think would be needed to convince you that abuse has taken place?  Can you acknowledge that the Bishop may have known about the abusive activities well before he was made to act? Even if you are correct in this one case, what you are discussing here would have to be more the unusual than the usual, given what we now know of the culture of cover up and shifting of offenders. Yes, we have righteous indignation - for the overall proven approach of Bishops who knew but didn't act.

0,"What I didn't realize at the time was that the way we projected the cost savings was a fraud.  We used charts showing how much the price of natural gas had risen over the previous ten years, and projected that rate of increase 30 years into the future, which made the cost savings from solar look very attractive in the long run, if not in the short run.  The retail price of natural gas had been capped by the FDR Administration during the Depression, and hadn't been deregulated.  Since oil producers couldn't make money on nat gas at that price, they just burned it off at the wellheads.  This led to a severe shortage in nat gas, so in the early 1970's, the price was deregulated.  As the price rose, more oil producers started capturing it and selling it into the market.  By 1983, the supply caught up with the demand, the price began to fall, and consumers didn't buy our projections any more, and stopped buying solar.  (cont'd)

The bigger problem is that the Republicans do just that and the pro-life movement is fooled.  The second problem is that their objectives are not only unattainable, but wrong.  Repealing federal jurisdiction in equal protection law is to give decisions on minority rights to the mob.  That the mob takes direction from Catholic bishops is not a point in its favor.  Truth is not about exercising raw political power, although the bishops seem to forget this, as does the pro-life movement (especially the inaptly named Susan B. Anthony Fund).  Roe is not going away.  If the new Justice is anti-Roe, that will be one vote for repeal (Kennedy, Scalia and Chief Roberts are no votes and Thomas is for declaring personhood federally).

Raising interest rates should help slow down the rate of increase in debt and that process has started; putting brakes on real estate in hot markets has also started. While I agree that these problems have been addressed later than they should have been, in Vancouver probably by decades, at the end of the day interest rates and control over housing markets are about all that can be used - what next?

Of course, many historians actually believe that to be true, that Pearl Harbor was an """"invited attack' arranged by FDR who believes we should get into the world conflict. But that would be counter intuitive. This can only be true if FDR knew ahead of time that Germany will declared war on US to support Japan and there was totally no guarantee that this will happened. Without Hitler's impulsive behavior that caught most people in the Third Reich completely by surprise and in utter dismay, US would have only gone to war with Imperial Japan and left Europe to her fate......an exact opposite of what FDR really want. Reason for this is that alliance between Japan and Germany was defensive. If Japan was attack or if German was attack, the other side will join the war. But clearly, Japan was the aggressor and Hitler had no obligation to do what he did.

Back then, Johnny Nusunginya, the hero of the Barrow Duck-In, was effectively gerrymandered out of office, as races in rural districts in those days largely favored candidates from the more populous part of the district.  Kotzebue has long prevailed over Barrow in this regard over the past half-century-plus.  Anyway, I wouldn't try to imply that Al Adams wasn't a real Democrat, but I'm pretty sure that he was in the House when the practice of the Republicans caucusing with Bush Democrats began.

0,"Palestinian factions in the central occupied West Bank city of Ramallah have called upon the Palestinian people to partake in a “Day of Rage” on Tuesday, during the planned visit by US President Donald Trump to the occupied Palestinian territory.  White House circulated a video publicizing his itinerary that showed a map of Israel that cut out the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and the occupied Golan Heights.  The map angered Israeli officials, and likely also alienated Palestinians for listing Trump’s schedule in both West Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank as under the heading “Israel.”

The paperwork & documentation required is not trivial, and if you need a lawyer to help then the filing fee is the least of your expenses.  As a result, permanent residents often wait until their green cards are about to expire before applying for citizenship and many simply renew their cards and remain permanent residents.  Of course, none ever thought they could be locked out of the country on no notice.  Today was one hell of a wake up call for a lot of people.

Requiring people to call for an appointment for bulky item pick-up will result in increased illegal dumping and just dumping in general on the streets and will also allow the City to impose pick-up fees which is the real reason they want to change to an appointment only system.  Kahikina's claim that general revenue funds being used to subsidize refuse operations is being taken from funding for fire, police,and parks is a lot of bull. Where does she think the funding for her department and therefore the funding for refuse operations come from to begin with. I am surprised she did not claim that funds were also being taken from seniors services and the keiki. Rather than cracking down on the abuses in her department, as usual, the solution is always more funding.

Most of his sermon (it was not a homily - note, he never referenced scripture or even Christ) could easily be refuted - intrinsic evil (not part of the church moral theology tradition); he is confused about sin and categories and his use of *prudential* (the usual traddie/right wing approach - all issues are prudential except abortion and same sex marriage - funny, he doesn't seem to realize that divorce is also an intrinsic evil; lying is too; etc.)  He fails to understand that the church's role is to educate the conscience - not replace it.  and withholding communion has gone out of style.

Now taking these into consideration and looking at SPUR's response we see gaps in their logic for banning him not her. They claim to have banned him for foul language, abuse, violence, violence towards women, and he is guilty and got banned, But she is guilty of foul language, and her son of abuse, violence and violence towards women. No action by SPUR. Thus the message I get from SPUR is the above is acceptable if your black and the other person white. As for the owners convince the CEO to do the right thing or pay simple.

What is much more likely is there is a genetic anomaly being expressed as a result of i) exposure to toxic environments or toxic food, drugs etc ii) depletion of vitamins and nutrients because of illness, pregnancy and malabsorption and so on, or iii) other triggers.

The media need to gain technical competency on issues of national importance, accommodate a broader non-elitist view and start listening to the people of this country.  Listening is tough when you have a lock on the microphone but until this happens the media corps will continue to be less and less relevant.   And the political system becomes vastly less stable.

The constitutional wording does not encourage, discourage, require, or prohibit the use of any particular method for awarding a state's electoral votes.  As a result of changes in state laws enacted since 1789, the people have the right to vote for presidential electors in 100% of the states, there are no property requirements for voting in any state, and the state-by-state winner-take-all method is used by 48 of the 50 states. States can, and have, changed their method of awarding electoral votes over the years.  The National Popular Vote bill uses the built-in method that the Constitution provides for states to make changes.

This was false, so maybe it was better for him that his resume wasn't blind and came with a turban-topped headshot.  Democratic Institutions:  I forget her name.  I just remember she was supposedly to bring in proportional representation and then became irrelevant when JT changed his mind on this promise.  Goodale and Morneau.  These guys had resume bona fides.  But one can't control our own borders, and the other tripled the promised deficit with no plan to turn off the spending spigot despite a hot economy provoking higher interest rates. (sigh)  Bennett:  MMIW Inquiry is """"working well"""".  Yeah, right.  Freeland:  Only because NAFTA is in the news right now.  She seems to prefer red dresses.

0,"Hypnotherapy is a vastly misunderstood and underutilized form of psychotherapy. It is disappointing but not surprising to read some of the quotes from the medical practitioners, asserting that medical professionals should have a monopoly on this method that they likely have very little understanding of outside of medical applications. The vast majority of hypnotherapy is conducted by professionals trained to build self-esteem, self-confidence, eliminate anxiety and depression, help people to lose weight and quit smoking, and dissolve fears and phobias. The assertion that only a """"medical professional"""" would know how to deal with someone experiencing psychosis or recalling a traumatic memory is preposterous, given medical professionals get no training in psychotherapy, and even psychiatrists these days are generally not trained in psychotherapeutic technique and have been """"educated"""" to believe that pharmaceutical solutions are the only solutions to mental health issues.

Those with faith in a deity or even in the particular one described in the Bible may be right; those without that faith or any other faith may also be right.

And as stated in this thread, fully automatic weapons are not illegal: they're just highly regulated. I am for REGULATION, not banning of firearms. I'll oppose anyone who has an agenda of banning firearms outright.  Firearms should only be possessed by those who wish to use them responsibly. It's worth regulating that. As I stated, you probably don't think anyone should be able to walk into a store and buy a rocket launcher so you understand that there needs to be regulation. We simply need smarter regulations - not bans. No confiscations (unless justified through some criminal behavior).

0,"At a recent income of $170,000 plus rental plus CPP, he is likely to be in his highest pre-death-year tax bracket, so it doesn't make sense to """"reduce his RRSP"""". Indeed, he is still contributing $50/mo. into it.  His RRSP / employment strategy is sound: He drops to part-time work at the same time as he has to convert to RRIF and make compulsory withdrawals, and earlier withdrawals are relatively small during his 3 years of part-time work. By the time he goes on pension, his tax rate will drop.  I don't understand why he is taking CPP, unless he just started, since he doesn't need the money and it will be highly taxed. OAS is not mentioned since now it would be all clawed back anyway, but he might consider claiming it a year from now when he might net something after clawback.  For tax rates, he has already figured out he is better off as an Ontario resident. Since he will spend more time in Quebec, he is advised to check with an accountant about maintaining his Ontario residency.

If Fred's premise is to   live off savings until 70...why not do both?   Collect your CPP and invest the proceeds for 5 years   from 60 to 65.  Do the math compounding that for 18 years or so.    The benefit of early CPP goes way past 79 in that case.  Taxes can make a huge difference and must be considered for each individual.

That means no more welfare benefits they receive on behalf of any American children they can't afford to support, schooling for children (including college tuition if the kids are old enough), all medical care, and whatever they need for food, etc, since they cannot legally be working. All of this should now become the responsibility of the church.  If they want to be cut off from government's reach, they can reject government generosity.

0,"FIrst off, bad headline. The group is anti-nuclear weapons, NOT anti-nuclear. Secondly, while I admire the sentiment, I really disagree with this. The reason is that it is easy for nations to hide what they are up to. For example, during China's great earthquake, at the south-end of their new lake, several hundred ppl were spotted pouring out from underground wearing radiation bunny suits. SEVERAL HUNDRED. While this was obviously a nuclear facility, for that many to pour out, meant that it was a production, not R&D facility.  It is obvious that CHina does not have 700 warheads, but many many more. If America, or America and Russia, were to drop our numbers to say 500 warheads, I have no doubt that WWIII would start INSTANTLY, since many of the Chinese leaders (including most of their military) believe that it is POSSIBLE to win a nuclear war. And considering that they are hard at work on anti-missile systems, I think that MAD is best.

Born and raised Catholic part of our religion dictates that to show respect and honor to the church altar before mass that we """"genuflect"""" which is defined as placing one or both knees on the ground. Catholics also Genuflect when during mass they receive the communion, the Holy body of Christ.  Other common """"take a knee folks"""" are those who do so to respect and honor royalty and knights who are being knighted by a King or Queen. The more common use of Genuflection today is by a man who """"takes a knee"""" as a sign of his love and dedication to the woman he is now asking to marry him.

Ridership on the San Juan rail was so low that fares were reduced to ZERO in order to get ridership up, yet the ridership continued to remain way below what had been estimated.  Since fares cover only part of rail's operating costs, underestimating ridership for Honolulu's rail means that the already large subsidy that will be required to operate it will have to be increased even more.  The City's only source of this kind of big money is the property tax, but Caldwell has said that he doesn't want to use it for rail.  The GET surcharge is the only realistic alternative, so Oahu residents should be prepared to pay it forever.  Of course, that obviates any increase in the GET for improving the quality of education, protecting the environment, or anything else that is important to people.

The Air Force is capable of creating emergency control towers. And now Trump Tweets that the Puerto Ricans always want hand-outs. He didn't whine about Texans and Floridians who needed disaster assistance whining about handouts after Irma. Maybe it's because TX and FL have electoral votes?

Obama broke new ground by defying the very structure of our government put in place by our founders to limit any one branches overreach.

Cooperation which often led to sensible bi-partisan legislation that truly served the electorate as a whole. Awash in his limitless arrogance Obama simply didn't care and now Dems will pay a price.

In the recent case it was two tribes trying to sue each other. I guess my question might be off topic but sometimes the lines between Native Corporations seem to get blurred with tribes and their sovereignty in Alaska. Confusing!

The walls that Pope Leo built, which were completed in 852, were nearly 40 feet high, twelve feet thick, and defended by dozens of towers that turned the site into a fortified city.  So the idea for a wall goes back to the Church.   And given that the Vatican's walls are 1300 yrs old, walls  seem to be a good idea.

I hope that no-one """"takes up arms"""" against Trump's voters or supporters, or against Trump himself.  I believe in our democratic institutions. I believe that eventually Trump will be held accountable in the democratic processes designed by the founders. The real threat of domestic violence in the Trump years, if there is one, will arise among the relatively small number of right wing nuts -- the racists, fascists and neo-nazis who make up his political base -- who, contrary to all reason, believed that Trump could and would do what he promised.  As it dawns on them that he can't and won't, and that in most instances never intended to, the threat of right-wing violence will be very real.  Trump is a racist and a fascist, for sure -- but he's also a plutocrat who wll always pursue personal aggrandizement above all else.

0,"Yoh, remember that paper surplus of a few million dollars in the final months of the Dosanjh NDP administration.  It was based on a pipe dream of collecting from California for providing power from the Burrard thermal generating station during the Made By Enron Power Crisis.  California decided that BC Hydro PowerEx and TransAlta were part of Enron's fraud, and demanded US $ 3.2 billion in fines instead of paying. BC Hydro got away with paying a bargain US $750 million to make it go away, and was stuck with the bill for the 100s of millions of natural gas it burned to generate the power exported to California. Enron drove up natural gas spot prices by creating unnecessarily congestion in gas transmission lines.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/bc-hydro-transalta-owe-california-millions-us-judge-rules/article8944884/  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/bc-utility-settles-energy-prices-dispute-with-california-from-2000/article13813512/

StatCan’s estimate of inflation for food at home and in restaurants from April 2016 to April 2017 was being compared with the FPR estimate of inflation for food at home only from January to May 2017. Now with the CPI May 2017 update, I calculated that over the same January-May 2017 period, the food at home inflation rate for the CPI was approximately 1.3% as opposed to 3.6% for the FPR. ( I used 2015 basket shares at December 2016 prices to weight groups in both sets of estimates.) For each food group both CP and  FPR showed the same sign, except fish and seafood, where, oddly, the CPI showed an increase and the FPR a decrease. This is a highly seasonal component where the choice of items to be priced would make a big difference over a five-month period.

Jesus was God become human; God is neither male nor female. The immortal spirit of God that took on flesh in Jesus was neither male nor female.  His maleness was immaterial to his Godhead.

Except that you are never completely wiped out if your luck changes. Instead, you live. In the letter referred to, Jensen said countries like German have long wait times and poor care.

What does the """"good news"""" from the doctrine of the trinity mean in a church where children have long been subject to sexual abuse, and those In charge even today, a full 15 years since all of this came to public lit, refuse episcopal accountability.  Does doctrine of the trinity trump basic human morality?  Does the modern choice to exclude women, or the church's refusal to enter a real dialog with the laity on its position on so many other hot button issues truly project the aura of """"good news"""" around the church?  How many of us even associate the church with good news?  Methinks some serious revamp is needed.

0,"That's true, but only when the economy is growing rapidly and there is a cash shortage. In that situation, Keynes recommended no government stimulus that would crowd out private ventures into markets. In conditions of stagnant growth and private cash hording, where we are today, Keynes recommended government direct job creation to inject money into the hands of consumers, whose buying would stimulate growth.  Tax cuts to corporations and people who are already swimming in cash won't create jobs or stimulate growth without demand for products from consumers. Without consumer demand, that cash won't be committed to economic growth. Therefore, tax cuts for the wealthy (and that's all the Republicans and Trump are interested in) won't move the meter on GDP. Paul Krugman has pointed out repeatedly that higher taxes have never reined in economic growth, and Keynes recommended demand side (consumer) stimulation with created jobs in times of slow growth.

If Duffy was paid to vote a certain way, or not vote at all, on something before him, that would be a bribe.  If he was paid just to keep quiet about something relating to him personally, that's not a bribe.  I do agree and have always argued, however, that if the transaction can be viewed as Duffy receiving a bribe, it also has to be viewed as Wright giving a bribe.  The real crime, of course, is that Wright will just go back to the Bay Street establishment, where he will be greeted warmly and resume making his mega-bucks without any sanctions at all.

0,"First off I would point out municipalities have no business giving out grants. Doing so amounts to a theft of taxpayer money. Grant money is never recouped regardless of the rationalizations people come up to suggest otherwise.  Secondly the square metre in taxes comparison used is highly erroneous. The city wide average would include all land use zones including commercial and industrial. On a per square metre basis all non-residential zoned property pay significantly lower taxes. Residential zoned property typically pays 2.5 to 3 times more in property taxes than the other property zones when looked at on a square metre basis. Which explains the difference shown in the article.  If municipalities are looking for greater property tax revenue they are best off approving high density housing, condos, townhouses and apartment buildings and stearing clear of single family heritage and non-residential zoning. Besides high density is the right thing to do environmentally and monetarily.

0,"The Electoral College was a compromise on two important issues.  The first was how much power the people should have, and the second was how much power small and large states should have.  Power to the People?  """"Democracy"""" was a dirty word in some people's minds:  it raised fears of mob rule which did happen during and after the Revolution.  Because the role of  the president was so important, most of the framers thought that the people couldn't be trusted to elect the president directly.  Instead people elect, Electors.  Power to the States?  Small states like New Jersey feared that if they formed a union with the other twelve states, they 'd be swallowed up under the influence of more populous states like New York.   That's why states have equal representation in the Senate but representation by population in the House.  It's a compromise that allowed large states to get their due but still allowed small states to keep their identities and fight for their interests.

He said he wouldn't like it, but he put the unity of the republic above all.  By 1863, Lincoln was losing popular support in the north because the population was war-weary (and tired of losing battle after battle to Lee).  Pressure was already afoot to cut their losses and end the war.  Lincoln was afraid northern voters would support suing for peace and letting the south go their own way.  His genius was in re-framing the war as an ethical battle against slavery....hence the Emancipation Declaration.  The Confederates laughed at the declaration because the Union was losing the war at the time.  It looked unenforceable.  But it did rally the northern voters around a cause which they actually felt more strongly about than the fate of the union.  History is more complex than it looks at first blush.

Again, you can easily go over the RDA if you make a conscious effort to spread out the protein consumption 3. kidney disease or other health problems.

Now I have seen people do things with guns, but that rifle resting in my gun case has never moved unless someone takes it out.  It is a shame how some people use guns to harm others, it is also a shame how some people use words to confuse others and obfuscate their meanings.

Alaska should never rely on one sector, i.e. oil an gas, as a means of obtaining all income.  We need to have a healthy look at why Alaska ranks so low and change that.  We certainly have the space to provide a place for other industry but we have to determine how to get them here to provide a more balanced job market and income to the state.  Discussing the size of government and the cost in 1975 $$ and expecting today to be the same is ridiculous.  First, the size of Alaska's population has doubled since 1975 and then there are those pesky things like consumer price index, producer price index, service providing PPI and more that show costs go up over time.  Before just declaring cuts need to be made, we should consider management audits and operational audits of the state as a whole to look for effectiveness and efficiency.

Do we teach our keiki that we're a nation of laws or do we tell them they can pick and choose which ones they obey. When our legislators are sworn in do they promise to uphold our country's laws? Seems to me that one of the key differences between developed nations and third world countries is the adherence to laws. I guess we're moving to become a world world State.

Two of the three passages that possibly refer to homosexuality are simply more-or-less miscellaneous catalogues of behaviors that are regarded as unacceptable, with no particular emphasis placed on any individual item in the list. 4. It may well be that the two lists of unacceptable behaviors—1 Corinthians 6:9–10 and 1 Timothy 1:8–11—do not refer to homosexuality at all. 5. Even if 1 Corinthians 6:9–10 and 1 Timothy 1:8–11 do refer to homosexuality, what they likely have in mind is not homosexuality per se but rather one particular form of homosexuality that was regarded as especially exploitative and degrading.""""

I remain unconvinced that foreign buyers are a major player but if it helps calm market psychology then that is a good thing.  The supply side tools, including a vacancy tax and possibly a tax on serviced land that is not being developed sound good in theory; the problem is that they are leaving this to municipalities to introduce. This adds an unnecessary delay plus the potential for getting hung up in political review.  The changes to reduce the relative tax penalties on rental developments are sensible. Rent control is a populist move that could go either way.  The anti """"scalping"""" measures target only new-build housing which is a small part of the market. There are no direct measures against speculation in already-built homes.  Hopefully if nothing else these measures  convince the market that things don't only go up.

0,"The tax treaty simply means that there is no withholding tax in retirement accounts (i.e. RRSP and LIRA).  That in itself doesn't make US content preferential for an RRSP account.  Canadian stocks that don't pay eligible dividends or dividends at all would be subject to the same rates of tax in a cash account as US stocks.  So depending on your tax rate now and projected tax rate in retirement and overall portfolio structure there may be a valid argument that your eligible Canadian dividends should be invested outside of your RRSP which may leave more room for US or other foreign content.  That said of course one also needs to consider capital gains taxation since an RRSP also results in capital gains being treated as regular income.  As you say one needs to figure out an optimum solution that works for them.  For most people that is likely going to result in their RRSP holding a mixture of Canadian and US content and a mixture of dividend stocks and non dividend stocks.

But what about Gideon Bibles?  They had a decades long association with Canadian public schools that opened up those schools for distribution of little bibles at a set grade level. Initially, those bible distributions were mandatory for any kids in the school systems that partnered with Gideon, and it was only with significant parental pressure that it was reduced over time to parental opt-in, and then eventually phased right out of the school day and made an annual event that occurred after school ended for the day. Part of why that practice ended was the growing public realization that even allowing time in the school day and use of school spaces for it to happen meant that the public tax dollar was being used to support private religious aims.

He didn't make his first appointment for several weeks (way behind the pace set by Trump)

Boerste is one example of a motorist who did not follow the law with deadly consequences. He killed someone and now he faces 6 years in jail, removing his productivity and costing taxpayers for his keep. Just as importantly, he will never earn back his license.  If he should start riding a bike to get around, he will be a person on a bike who used drugs while driving and killed someone.

But PASHA's ability to build 4 new hulls to replace 4 old steamships not entirely clear (yet). TOTE will court their existing customer base in Northwest, since they already have established operation from Seattle to Alaska. Seattle to Honolulu is a heavy construction cargo supply line.

Strategic MAD makes a major engagement risky for the human race but on a conventional level, across the board and by the numbers, the Russians are vastly outmatched. That's before NATO members make their contribution.  All pie-in-the-sky anyway, Russia's GDP is less than California's by orders of magnitude and in relative terms going in the wrong direction, along with a number of other key indices.

In addition, the Bernie Sanders progressives want universal federally funded higher ed for all who are qualified. That would undermine a special contract with prospective MDs, it seems to me. Maybe higher ed in general could be federally funded in return for a specific number of years of assigned national service at low pay? How would expanded Medicare be different from expanded Medicaid, which most red states refused? Some of those states with high populations of poor have a high Medicaid co-pay cost. The Louisiana governor recently stated that 47% of the state budget went to Medicaid.  Health care is expensive no matter who pays for it; but with Medicaid largely out of the picture, the total cost likely will go down as people cut their costs or forgo health care altogether. Dems """"owned"""" the ACA. They were shut out completely in designing the AHCA, which is 100% (R).

Go back to 1978, use CARA data or even the Vatican's Annual publication of church statitstics, and trace  the course of the divisions in the church, and of the losses of church members.  Francis is not the cause, he is trying to heal the divisions that took place long before he was elected.  It will fail, most likely, because of the staunch opposition of the bishops appointed by his predecessors and of those who admire the viewpoints of those bishops. They want Francis to fail.  The hemorraging of Catholics from the western church accelerated after 1978, and continued to accelerate for the next three+ decades. The fall in numbers of priests and women religious followed the same downward course.  This course has not been reversed, and is not likely to be reversed quickly - if ever.  But the cause of the loss of tens of millions of cradle Catholics, and of the divisions among those who remain, cannot be laid at the door of Pope Francis.

Instead of increasing property taxes, creating and expanding programs it can't afford, and a school district that can't control its spending, wouldn't it be fairer for Anchorage to adopt a 8-9% sales tax? Why should residents of Seward be forced to pay an income tax, because Anchorage can't get their fiscal house in order. Isn't restructuring the PF enough for the state to get by on?

In fact the laws violated crimes against humanity laws, the Helsinki accord, and directly the Nuremberg Laws which we signed.  Canadian governments sterilized,  humiliated,  legally subjugated and used  'legal bigotry based on  looks, ancestry, name and disability either congenital or by injury.  Powerful people ordered the victims assaults in the name of Canada to expunge the unwanted and returning them to the sender (GOD).  Some were killed and had their organs stolen for the betterment of Canada and science. All this without consent or using cohesive consent which legal scholars call wrong - it was a form o state terror all masked as legitimate. The Osgoode Law called the laws used """"legal mayhem"""". The constitution called the laws illegal, but the eugenic laws persisted.  Why does Omar get any voice?

0,"""""It stuns me that a member of Congress listened into that conversation""""  If I'm remembering correctly, what I heard yesterday was that Trump's call came in as Mrs. Johnson was en route to the airport to receive the body of her husband. She put her phone 'on speaker' and Rep. Wilson could not help but hear what was said. Therefore, it's rather unfair to suggest that she listened in or behaved inappropriately.  What the president should have known is that although a call from any president is something of an honour, some moments are better than other. In fact, some moments would be entirely inappropriate.  Phoning someone you do not know (and even many that you do know) as they are about to receive the body of their beloved spouse or child isn't likely to be great timing. A more sensitive person would have known that.

0,"The ACA insurance is repackaged catastrophic medical insurance heavily subsidized by the federal government. These are typically high deductible, high copay plans that are accepted by a limited number of providers. Those high payments before insurance kicks in means that insurance companies are taking in a lot of money while paying out almost none.  The whole thing was intended to be a 'legacy' for President Obama and it was. His name is on it and it will be credited with more citizens having health coverage than before it was passed. There's no mention of how useful that coverage was nor how they had to create penalties for people who weren't going to pay for something they couldn't use.

People who are living in misery and danger, far greater than many of us can imagine, are bring driven by sheer desperation to a better life.  People like that used to come here for many years; most were not welcomed, but tolerated.  But through most of that time, with some exceptions, it was possible for them to settle here and remain.  For some time now, we have embarked upon a heartless path of sending back many of those people to the misery that they flee.  This policy is heartless toward the newcomers and in counterproductive for the US.

Exactly the reason the FBI protocol for not releasing any information into any ongoing investigation let alone information that he knew would be political dynamite. He had no idea what was in those emails so until he did there was no reason for him to assume anything about them to the extent of sending that very confusing letter to the very people who most assuredly would run to the press with nothing but more hints and allegations to smear Clintons character. Comey buckled to the intimidation of the Republican congress just as the media has buckled to the incessant """"liberal media"""" attacks.

Bernie has been an independent for a very long time (and I do like him), but that doesn't help him get into the Party just because he wanted their campaign money and political apparatus.

Hillary was getting the non-religious and the athiests and he was getting the evangelicals.  There are lots more Christians than athiests in this country.

0,"I'm in complete agreement, even though I framed my opinion as a bit of a joke.  Before our mid-20s, the brain is still developing, and habits are being formed that will last a lifetime. Delaying drinking or smoking or toking until 25+ will let the brain develop without chemical distortions, and will stop habitual patterns from becoming ingrained. This would be a good thing. Fewer smokers, drinkers, and tokers would come out of late adolescence, and fewer life-long health problems would burden the health care system.  But...but...but...  Government tax revenues generated off drinking, smoking, and toking would be vastly reduced. That's the reason why we'll never see it.  After 25+, let people take what they want. Make it all legal, tax it all, and control it all. They're truly adults at that point.  Oh, I wouldn't let anyone under 25 vote either. Or join the military. Or drive a vehicle.

0,"Another insult to intelligence. When I came to Eugene in 1985 living on the streets destitute our housing was so affordable you could purchase a home earning the federal minimum wage. In 1986 affordable housing meant living the American dream for every one who worked. Today affordable housing means Section 8, housing subsidy, where no one gets ahead, or is able to get off the liberal plantation, the welfare state. We could be building neighborhoods full of entry level starter homes that can be purchased earning the federal minimum wage, and especially with the historic low interest rates...but liberalism, a social cancer on our state, will not allow this housing. Housing that lifts the working poor to middle class standards is called """"urban sprawl"""" and justified to inflict human suffering.

Canada's closer link to European socially responsible politics is to thank for it all.  And we ought all to give thanks. It's not perfect , but it's a pretty good start.

Makers of vaping and the products got under the radar of the FDA and got their products to market knowing that there would be no regulations of what may be needed to determine product safety in humans which involves a very long term study on users that follows their health for a decade or longer.  So just saying that vaping is not harmful is a myth as the FDA caught off guard with the quick marketing of vaping has to study the product long term, so the human guinea pigs are thus created, good luck with that. This has been done before in the tobacco industry, market the product no matter what and pay the big fines and lawsuits as a costs of doing business.

As far as masculinity being necessary for ordination to the Catholic priesthood, I don't think for one moment that the fathers attending the Council of Trent would ever have considered for a fleeting moment that a woman could be ordained to any order, major or minor. Hence there would have been no reason whatsoever for masculinity to be stipulated, it was simply taken for granted. As well as this, the Council of Trent was convened to refute the errors of Protestantism and the 'ordination' of women to any form of ministry was not one of those errors at the time. Protestant ministers were going to be men for the next 450 plus years.

They must be assigned rendezvous GPS coordinates, where, within a specified window of time, they transfer supplies and munitions. CBGs retire from FEBA, and logistics venture only close enough, but out of effective range of enemy targeting, for the CBGs to return to action within a reasonable amount of time. FEDEX and UPS are highly qualified in military logistics, while the Navy's in-house ability has atrophied considerably from WW-2, Korea, and even Viet Nam standards.

My dear brother and sister are business Repubs. I only vote for the best person, never by political parties. But, since Bush I no longer vote for Repubs. Now, since Trump I am almost feeling sorry for the moderate Repubs like my brother and sister. I hope these particular comments make sense to all and especially to you. For me the common good is so very important. That belief is driven by my occupation, for human beings and in memory of my grandparents who came over on the boat from Barrea, Italy and lost two children on that boat (my mothers side of the family) on boat

There is clear and broad evidence that physicians were inattentive to (a) whether the medication was appropriate for the patient's situation, (b) how appropriate dosage levels were, (c) how appropriate the duration of the prescription was, (d) how much was being diverted to mis-use (e) whether appropriate disposal procedures were being followed, and yards more.

Tony did say exactly what I reported here. He did not like the Rule as it was written, as it was too subject to """"subjective"""" considerations. So he said we should set aside the subjective review and focus only on the single objective criterion, whether she satisfied the 6 month requirement.  You and the others embarrassed the party by trying to substitute your arbitrary decisions over the will of the Democratic voters in the Senate District. We looked like Keystone Kops. As well we should have. Fortunately, I was able to convince our delegates to delete the six-month membership requirement at this last convention, so we will be able to avoid MOST of these sorts of problems in the future.  The reason Cedric did not run as a Dm in 2014 appears to have been the silly 6-month rule.

This initiative includes a set of drug policies that are intended to discourage the production, distribution, and consumption of psychoactive drugs that the participating governments and the UN have made illegal. The term was popularized by the media shortly after a press conference given on June 18, 1971, by United States President Richard Nixon—the day after publication of a special message from President Nixon to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control—during which he declared drug abuse """"public enemy number one"""".  Today, the Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for an end to the War on Drugs, estimates that the United States spends $51 billion annually on these initiatives.  War on Drugs did not create Drug Cartels.

Another fundamental, of which nothing has been said, is a land survey to mark off who owns what.  In the US some of the most enthusiastic and successful settlers were Volga Germans, whose ancestors had accepted an offer to move to Russia for exemption from military service and guarantees that they could continue in their own religion and language.  When successors to Catherine the Great revoked these exemptions, they left and were welcomed with enthusiasm by the railroads, which had all that prime prairie to unload, in the hope that the new farmers would produce crops,and thus revenue producing cargo.

Beau was covered by the State of Delaware benefits program and Tricare for his military participation. He passed away in  Walter Reed National Military Medical Center which in itself, is a big clue.  Joe Biden was concerned how his son's family could manage without a suitable income which prompted his thoughts on selling his house.

In 1953 both the American CIA and the British  Secret Intelligence Service overthrew Mohammad Mosaddegh the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran. It was a grab for the oil that was about to be nationalized by the Iranian PM. Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq was overthrown by the U.S. as was  Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi in Libya. The US also attempted to over-throw Bashar Hafez al-Assad of Syria. In all these cases the outcome for those countries was the creation of chaos and death. John fails to see the connection.

The main thing the US embargo did was give Fidel a fig leaf to cover his regime and its command economy. . Remember in the early 60s....Castro decided...against all logic...to try and take over the world sugar market.  He didnt. The price of sugar fell, the Cuban economy collapsed, nothing on the store shelves by 1964. Cuba had to get the Soviet Bloc to bail them out.

See, for just one example among many:  Aquinas, in the Summa Theologica Supplement, q 39 art 1 considers the question, """"Whether the female sex is an impediment to receiving Orders?"""". He says that it is, for two reasons. The first is that women are inferior to men, """"since it is not possible in the female sex to signify eminence of degree, for a woman is in the state of subjection, it follows that she cannot receive the sacrament of Orders"""". The other has to do with the tonsure being inappropriate for women.  Though the traditionalists don't admit it, this is still their real argument. They try to pretty it up with words like """"complementarity"""" and """"ontological differences"""", but """"inferior"""" is what they really mean.

Off course it will mean including Leitch and Trost so would be interesting to see how a cabinet with Chong and Trost sitting at the same table.  My hope is that both Leitch and Trost lose their seats next election.  Trost unlike in the past is an urban riding so as long as the left isn't divided he can easily be taken out.  He only won prior to 2015 when his riding included a large rural portion while in 2015 due to vote splitting.  Defeating Leitch will be tougher as she is rural Ontario which pretty much always goes conservative unless the right is divided.  Sadly Raitt's riding is quite vulnerable as it is 905 belt and most growth is from people from Toronto so if the party does better she wins, but if worse she probably loses.  Chong's riding is quite safe and he is personally very popular in his riding.

1,"I hate it when some group of ignorant city employees use numbers and call them data. For instance, we don't actually have crash data here, just some numbers that represent a small fraction of the total crashes with an uneven distribution that is biased by income. Any crash that does not involve either a fatality, an ambulance ride or rather large property loss is not logged by EPD as a crash. Therefore, when a cyclist who doesn't have deep pockets and/or insurance to cover the ambulance ride is struck by a motorist, odds are that there will be no police report.  What the Zero Vision committee has done is collect crash numbers for streets with lots of crashes involving insurance claims. That will bias the numbers away from vulnerable road users (not my term, it's the official designation of cyclists and pedestrians).  The traffic planner in charge of the committee is aware of this, which is why she defends the plan by saying that motorist deaths and injuries are important to reduce.

A do-over Lib campaign with some better policies will be matched by the same approach from the others.  For every Lib leaning voter who went Green and wants to rethink that, there is probably some other voter who rejected Greens as no hope and now sees them as a viable third party choice.  What WOULD  make a difference is if the Greens/NDP decided to place candidates strategically in the strongest support areas, with only a Green or Dipper to choose from in some ridings.  They could do battle in ridings with equal support. That would extend their semi-coalition agreement to beyond the next election and would deal with the reality that the NDP alone can't likely get enough seats for a stable government (luck excepted) but could handily defeat the Liberals if they teamed up in advance.

Sorry, but once he asked the public for help to start his business (why not get a business loan from a bank?) he was giving the message he would be serving all the public, not just those whose weddings he likes or agrees with because of his religious beliefs.

0,"I see no indication historically that the Gospel and Paul's teachings were directed at Jews. Possibly the first Christians were Jews (if there were any Christians before Paul and his group). However, Paul preached to the """"Gentiles,"""" that is, those Pagans known as """"God-fearers"""" who supported Jewish synagogues financially and who practiced a form of monotheism, but did not observe the 613 rules of the Jews. Thus a new reform of Paganism, that retained elements of their story of the dying and rising Lord and his Lady resonated with the God-fearers. Also the words put on """"Jesus'"""" lips castigating the rule-bound Pharisees also resonanted with those reluctant to adopt 613 rules. Likewise Paul's opposition to circumcision resonated. A popular reform. Still with us today. But it was not given to actual Jews, who would have known the Pagan story of Lord and Lady and automatically rejected it. I think probably there was a preacher known as Jesus of Nazareth and Paul built a story around him.

0,"You are correct. However I will say this. Whoever instructed them when they took their CCW classes missed the boat. If you have a CCW and are armed there are things you need to do and not do when pulled over. If pulled over here is the best policy. Pull over ASAP. Turn off engine. Turn on dome light. Roll down window. Driver should have both hands on wheel. Passenger should have both hands on dash. Tell police there is a firearm on person or in car. Do not move until instructed to do so. The cop was wrong and race was a major factor as you stated. But carrying a firearm has great responsibility. Its not enough to know the laws. You must also know and practice what to do when dealing with those who enforce the laws. I have been pulled over many times while carrying. In every case I have always done exactly what Ive posted here. In every case there has never been an issue.  Do as I suggest and the police will thank you. All CCW instructors should teach this.

In Alberta's case, the province gained the amazing sum of 7% of wholesale prices in royalties, all the while having the taxpayers pony up for roads, bridges, schools, fire halls, police stations, bus stations, other transit stations, maintenance and repair, water purification, garbage collection, hospitals, and a host of other things that these communities require to be viable.

The Amendment says nothing about -membership- in such a militia, nor that the militia is the sole reason for the right, merely the political one (given it is a political document). Which makes sense because a militia is not a standing army but rather is made up of individual people who, when called up, would need to already be armed and competent with their individually owned weapons.  Because well-read voters are necessary to the good government of a free state, the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed is a parallel phrasing. Voting's merely one reason to protect books.

Not only does their statistic combine alcohol and drugs, but also subtly suggests that one or both were factor in the crashes.  MADD appears to be a latter-day temperance group.  They would prefer to have a zero-tolerance policy because alcohol is the evil of our times.  Secondly, an interesting statistic would be the level of alcohol in the perpetrators of drunk driving crimes. If the alcohol level in the majority was above 0.08, then lowering the legal level to 0.05 will do precious little to reduce impaired driving crashes.

Solid intention but doesn't change the nature of the moral act which is speaking falsehood.

They are actually better suited for the exact opposite.  Alaska's corporate statutes and regulations allow Native Corporation Board's to control elections with near impunity, unless the existing board is willing to ensure fairness. If the existing board chooses to go the other way and prevent the election of shareholders other than themselves, the statutes allow them to do that. Alaska's Supreme Court has ruled that the statutes place authority in the boards to determine how elections are conducted through the bylaws. Mr. Blatchford is correct that fairness can only be ensured through legislation; legislation that corporate management will likely oppose. And they control the corporate dollars and lobbyists to prevent any reforms.  Reforms will have to come from a groundswell of Shareholders statewide.

Now I hear some uninformed self-appointed militiaman decided to build a road through one of those sites.  I guess they can bulldoze spawning beds and nesting grounds too because they  are real men and not accountable to anyone.  I suspect that what these intruders  really care about is a land grab and cheap grazing rights for their cattle back in their home states.  Many ranchers in Oregon are responsible caretakers of the land.  They've worked out creative solutions with government agencies and environmental groups to continue using the property while protecting streambanks and wildlife.  Too bad the reasonable voices of conscientious Oregon citizens are being drown out by these outsiders.

The U.S. had 319 million people in 2014, but 228 billion trees (716 trees per person). Brazil had 301 billion trees (1,494 per person), Canada 318 billion (8,953 per person), and China 139 billion (102 trees per person). Among highly populous countries, India (population, 1.267 billion) had a tree population of only 35 billion, leading to just 28 trees per person.  Since a single tree absorbs 47 lbs of carbon emissions, that works out to absorbing 423,000 lbs of CO2 per Canadian.  So why does Canada have one of the highest carbon taxes in the world when Australia’s carbon tax was introduced at $23 per tonne of CO2 or Chile at $5 per tonne of CO2,

In many cases you are talking about large areas of land that is seldom used, and small numbers of people that actually use this land.It can never be sold to the rest of Canada, that projects that will produce millions in tax dollars that will benefit all, can be stopped by a miniscule portion of the population. Even the Supreme Court who has ruled favourably on many aboriginal issue, and who has had an aboriginal supporter for many years, in Chief Justice Beverly McLaughlin, has never gone as far as a veto.

It’s a work towards integration, all doors are open, but we cannot say, ‘from here on they can have communion.’ This would be an injury also to marriage, to the couple, because it wouldn’t allow them to proceed on this path of integration. And those two were happy. They used a very beautiful expression: we don’t receive Eucharistic communion, but we receive communion when we visit hospitals and in this and this and this.

The other alternative would be that they engineer a coup and eliminate Kim Jong Un and his supporters and put in a more malleable puppet with a plan  for reunification of  Korea.  With US troops gone, a unified Korea who could be heavily  influenced by the Chi Coms would be to their liking. The Chi Coms are also not ready as yet to confront the US militarily and they would come out the loser although it could be argued that their demise would make for a better world given their imperialistic ambitions for world domination.

Also Reindeer were reintroduced by Dr. Sheldon Jackson in 1905 (?) who along with Reindeer also brought  in Sami Herders to help learn about handling and care of the Deer.

Yes, if interest rates go up the value of a bond drops, but only if you are trying to sell it before it matures.  A quick check on my broker's site shows a number of  'A' and higher rated bonds that mature in 2021 that are paying just under 2%.  Why not buy these and double your return?

0,"Sally, existing law is on the books for anyone to view.  Nothing on the books gives judges the power to second guess national security issues.  Moreover, I suggest you try a test on progressive control of the media.  Log in to the RGs website and look at the last 10-20 or 100 opinion pieces published regarding Trump.  Tally those with positive things to say in one column and negative things to say in another column.  If your count ends up like mine, you will have about 90 percent of the opinion pieces with an anti-Trump message.  Such a lopsided opposition to Trump does not represent the feeling of American citizens who are much more evenly divided.  It does not matter who owns the media.  It matters only who works there and their political feelings.  As long as the """"news"""" organization makes money selling its progressive message, its owners will be totally happy.

0,"""""Property tax is based on a percentage value of your home.""""  Property tax is based on the value of your home relative to other homes in the municipality and dividing that value into the municipality's operating budget. Assuming the operating budget stayed flat (yeah right), the amount of tax $ owed for a place would be IDENTICAL if everybody's assessment decreased by exactly 50%. The city would just double the rate owed per $1000 in assessed value. If your property taxes have gone up two things have likely happened: 1) the operating budget for the municipality has increased and 2) your property has increased in worth relative to other properties in the municipality. Regarding #2 in Vancouver, that has sometimes meant annual increases in value of over 6 figures in successive years. Being asked to pay a few hundred or even a couple thou more seems like a pretty small price to pay in light of that reality.

By definition, they are only 50% efficient -- they can only operate at night. That efficiency is reduced even more by non-viewing days. Robotic space telescope observatories operate 365/24/7 and view quadrants of the sky, not single targets through a 30-meter straw. There is only one Mauna Kea, space telescope observatories can be built anywhere, and will be. TMT isn't a good investment for Hawaii island. It will be like the rail in Honolulu. TMT is estimated to take 8 to 10 years construction and assembly. Only the construction will be local contractors, assembly will be with off-island professional crews. It will take 2 years to first light, so possibly 12 years before TMT hiring. By then, it will be possible to have space telescopes with apertures of miles, instead of meters.

Instead, Governor García Padilla wants Congress to extend the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and Supplemental Social Security Income to the commonwealth. Yet expanding the welfare state will likely further reduce its labor participation rate.  But Catholic economists typically see no problems with welfare state policies, and have no clue about how wealth is generated.

0,"During the First Palestinian uprising (1989) before suicide attacks (or rockets from Gaza) existed in Israel and when nearly a thousand youths armed with no more than stones were killed by the IDF, an American-Palestinian named Mubarek Awad set up the """"Centre for Non-Violent Civil Disobedience"""" in Jerusalem. He was promptly deported.  A few years earlier (1982) Israel used the attempted assassination of its ambassador in Europe by a breakaway PLO group to invade Lebanon and """"crush PLO terror."""" (17,000 casualties, mostly civilian).  In reality, the PLO had been observing a US brokered truce for the 11-past months and publicly debating for the first time a two state solution, thus quickly gaining international acceptance with even the Vatican inviting Arafat for an audience. It was this that then-PM Menachem Begin (A wanted terrorist during the British Mandate) found intolerable.  Israel always feared Palestinian diplomacy far more than its violence.

0,"Mokantx,  Just getting back ; to clarify a point in my reply to you 2 days ago.  Just recalling that both JP2 & B16 centralised power in the Vatican, as a counter movement to Vatican II policies being implemented by liberally minded bishops, throughout the Catholic world.  While Fr. Ratizenger attended as one of the two youngest theologians; to advise and assist the German Hierarchy; he was an ultra-conservative. Equally so JP2; who both carefully selected ultra conservative bishops through their Papal Nuncios. Very similar personal profile templates used.  The net result is, that we end up with 36 years of ultra conservative appointments. Some of these are Cardinals and still under 80 and thus eligible to vote in the next Conclave to elect a new pope. The overall effect is that the Curia had the backing of both JP2 & B16 to dig their heels in; put up the steel shutters and lock the doors; thus killing-off any Vatican II aspirations or  objectives being achieved. It's all about power.

It's place in the laws of our State can find themselves within the context of civil/human rights.  It is difficult to manage, however, because the last line of Kanawai Mamalahoe is """"hewa no, make (Break this law and die),"""" which suggest capital punishment (which we do not have here).

His proposition for the Electoral College included the “three-fifths compromise,” where black people could be counted as three-fifths of a person, instead of a whole. This clause garnered the state 12 out of 91 electoral votes, more than a quarter of what a president needed to win.  “None of this is about slaves voting,” said Finkelman, who wrote a paper on the origins of the Electoral College for a symposium after Gore lost. “The debates are in part about political power and also the fundamental immorality of counting slaves for the purpose of giving political power to the master class.”  He said the Electoral College’s three-fifths clause enabled Thomas Jefferson, who owned more than a hundred slaves, to beat out in 1800 John Adams, who was opposed to slavery, since the South had a stronghold.

0,"Disagree.  The U.S. can't be first to use nuclear arms regardless of the circumstances.  That would destabilize international relations worldwide and put the whole human race at risk.  We have tremendous technological superiority over North Korea in conventional arms.  We need to take advantage of that superiority now before Kim Jong Un has multiple ICBMs carrying hydrogen bombs at his disposal.  The window to act is rapidly closing.  The military and civilian casualties North Korea will inflict before the U.S. deposes Kim's regime will be a terrible price to pay, but the potential consequences of delay and appeasement are immensely worse.

Perhaps the fact that governments before this one have all looked for alternative markets and they have come up empty. Maybe it simply comes down to something simple like the fact that this Minister is not really good at playing poker, as the States certainly knows a bluff when they see one. The Minister can only hope his bluff isn't called, as then we all lose.

0,"I would love to be your investment manager if you believe the BS they are spewing.  The Perm Fund has only earned 6.4% over the last 5 years, and 1.35% over the last 12 months. So if we had those 5% bonds outstanding, we would have made 1.4% over the last 5 years, and lost 3.65% over the last year. Again, the only thing you guarantee with POBs is what you have to pay bondholders.  Financial accounting 101 tells us that, unless you have a fixed rate security that is guaranteed by the US Gov and you hold it to maturity, your future earnings are anything but certain. So a snake-oil salesman pitching an 8% return on our investment is a liar.  Now, if the bankers are so certain we can earn 8%, perhaps they would be willing to put that in writing and put their balance sheet at risk--like they are asking us to do. I am confident you would see the backside of their $2k Brooks Brothers suits heading out the door if you proposed that clause.

Yes, the Democratic establishment is also corrupt with partisanship blinding their ability to choose because the money making machine based on hate for the other party won't let the people decide in open elections. Our political process has been hijacked and Trump won on that. He saw the party ignoring it's voting base with calls of trickle down, the rich are job creators, corporations are people. His solution? It's immigrants, terrorists, the Japanese, Chinese, fat women and female anchors who have """"blood coming out....everywhere"""". Now we could argue who is worse: Democrats or Republicans.

The foundation is the most important part of a house and if your foundation was built ignoring the principles of gravity and construction, it will eventually tear your house apart. You can fix the wall board cracks and try to level the floors, but if the foundation is faulty, eventually, the house will fall down. You can't fix a truly buggered foundation without taking down the house.  And, that's what we have with the ACA. It was created ignoring the principles of economics - supply and demand and the customer fixing the price by what the market will bear and what the customer needs. That's what's causing the problems - exorbitant premiums, insane deductibles, insurance companies pulling out of markets across the nation. Because the foundation is totally buggered, the law itself is not repairable. It needs to be repealed. Whatever replaces it, should be based on sound economic principles or problems will will reoccur.

There are some baptisms which are NOT recognized as valid.

Baptisms of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints are not recognized even though they do this because they teach that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are men, not Persons in the One triune God.

True the changing ethnic and cultural mix in Canada is a major factor in hockey's decline.

For those of us who grew up with and played hockey, this is very sad.  Perhaps a partial answer is for the NHL in self preservation to  subsidize hockey for youngsters.

The fines issued by the competition commission are merely seen by these businesses as a cost of maintaining their market dominance and thus this unethical and immoral behaviour continues unabated.  Until price fixing is criminalised and those involved are forced to do jail time, this situation will persist.  The investigative journalists are also falling short in reporting adequately in this area.  In all of the cases of price fixing that I have read over the years, I cannot remember in any instance that it was ever reported who the individuals were in these """"secret meetings"""" where prices and markets were discussed and agreed to.  Until these people are named and shamed ..

0,"I agree with Ms. Southey, and I fully support the renaming of a building so prominent in our civic life. It acknowledges the damage we have done to the Indigenous peoples, and contributes to our ongoing reconciliation with them.  Yet such efforts are fraught with ambiguity. Sir John A. Macdonald deliberately starved Indigenous peoples into submission in western Canada. Yet we can't very well remove his visage from our public spaces.  As a proud Canadian, I admire Sir John A. But his unspeakable cruelty to Canada's First Nations deeply saddens me and has greatly tempered my admiration for him.  We must confront our history's dark side if we are to reconcile with our Indigenous peoples. It will take a lot more than renaming a building. We must honour national hereoes, but we must also recognize the terrible things they did in our name.  (If you doubt that Sir John A used starvation as a weapon against the First Nations, read James Daschuk's """"Clearing the Plains"""". It's an eye-opener.)

In this it was probably an inspiration for the commission, which was intended to serve a similar function: provide the appearance of doing something, while engaging in the same old conduct.  A better approach might be for the pope and bishops to actually do what Christ would expect of them and stop engaging in the evil of protecting child rapists, even if that means bad press.  But, instead of being disciples of Christ, I guess they will remain disciples of the institution.

That they (some of them) are juveniles is important, socially, psychologically and legally.  Even a well-parented and seemingly adjusted 16-year-old is not fully developed.  These young men will be tried as adults and hence they can, if convicted, be given lengthy prison sentences.  But they cannot, and should not, be treated as, say, junior Charlie Mansons.  They're not.  One or more of them may someday feel genuine remorse and try to construct a better life, even behind bars.  I have been close, in a professional capacity, to violent crimes.  If it were my son who was killed, I would be tormented by desires to take my own revenge.  But we are either a society of free people living under laws, or we become a mob.

0,"Support for a national popular vote has been strong in rural states  None of the most rural states is a battleground state. The current system does not enhance the influence of rural states, because the most rural states are not battleground states, and they are ignored.  Their states’ votes are taken for granted by the dominant party in the states, and ignored by all parties in campaigns. When and where voters are ignored, then so are the issues they care about most.  A successful nationwide presidential campaign of polling, organizing, ad spending, and visits, with every voter equal, would be run the way presidential candidates campaign to win the electoral votes of closely divided battleground states, such as Ohio and Florida, under the state-by-state winner-take-all methods. The big cities in those battleground states do not receive all the attention, much less control the outcome.  When and where every voter is equal, a campaign must be run everywhere.

Stevie Wonder began a performance in Central Park Saturday night by taking a knee, prompting Congressman Joe Walsh to tweet that Wonder was “another ungrateful black multi-millionaire.” Ungrateful is the new uppity. Trump’s supporters, by a twenty-four-point margin, agree with the idea that most Americans have not got as much as they deserve, though they overwhelmingly withhold the right to that sentiment from African-Americans. Thus, the wonder is not the unhinged behavior of that week but rather that it took Trump so long to exploit a target as rich in potential racial resentment as wealthy black athletes who have the temerity to believe in the First Amendment.

0,"No, the fentanyl problem did not start with """"mis-prescribed fentanyl patches"""". It started with thefts from pharmacies and patient's homes. Fentanyl is an excellent pain medication when used properly. The fact that it is potent allows it to be used in a patch, with less risk of addiction than pills like codeine, because it is a slow release formulation. Rapid onset mediations are more likely to cause addiction. The synthetic fentanyl analogues are the real problem. carfentanyl and newer ones resistant to naloxone (the antidote) are particularly worrisome. You can blame crime rings for this mess.

In fact, if you read Scripture carefully, Jesus had as many female friends (Martha and her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalen and others) as male friends. Most of the apostles were probably married, since Jewish law required adult males to marry and generate children as soon as possible in adulthood. Most Church historians agree that the move towards an all-male """"celibate"""" clergy came about because the Church did not want the children of married clergy to have any claim upon the wealth of their father's parishes or dioceses.  Solution: have no offspring (at least none that you acknowledge!) This  crazy solution to preserving the wealth of the Church has led to all kinds of serious abuses against women, children and teens over many centuries. We must end mandatory celibacy for parish priests now! (and while we are at it, ORDAIN WOMEN!)

What about St Joseph's loving (and protective) care and cooperation with the pregnancy, not turning her away, protecting her, fleeing when there was danger, helping her stay on the good side of the law (Census, shielding her from shame of divorce, etc.).  Parenting is much more than conception and the physical act of giving birth.  Gracious.  The secular world has such a shrunken understanding of so much, parenthood, faith, God, love, Scripture, sin, grace, the communion of saints, our cooperation with God's will and plan for the world...etc.  As the pope has pointed out there's also a much bigger understanding about feminism which the secular world and fundi-cats don't understand.

But we do have a very strong Govt led by a PM who occasionally visits us in between paid holidays. Oh yeah.  We  can do quite well without the US, thank you. After Trudeau eliminates our oil and gas sector and Trump crushes our exports  , we will be free at last of that nasty notion called wealth.

I think brand loyalty, say to Fox News or MSNBC (or Democrats or Republicans), regardless of content, actually creates the echo chamber, because it eliminates the act of thinking. Instead of just taking whatever is shoveled, and by examining the content in detail, piece by piece, and thinking critically about it, news consumers can determine themselves how credible each piece is. In reality, even the best writers have off days, and even the worst journalists stumble upon real news.

This is a legal practice used by many wealthy individuals but is it ethical and fair. It certainly is not in case of Prime Ministers who are responsible for the Tax Policy. In effect they have devised a tax policy that requires a higher tax burden for ordinary canadians than they and their wealthy friends bear.

When upper elements of this bureaucratic structure i.e. the Deep State, actively thwart such executive policy they SUBVERT the Will of the People, the ones who elected the Executive and his policy program. In so doing the Deep State acts profoundly anti-democratically.

0,"muck, It gets worse the public sector unions agreed to remove public sector wages from social security. So new teachers and cops can work a lifetime and have no pension or social security when they are old. So greedy teachers and cops with pensions who were hooray for me and to bad for you are now working side by side doing the same job as the to bad for you teachers and cops with no pensions. The hooray for me crowd are not saying a word. If the conversation comes up the hooray for me crowd blames the state. The haves and the have-nots working side by side. Huge disparity. Completely unfair. Most of the hooray for me cops are gaming the union overtime now so they can retire in their early 40s and start getting $10,000.00 a month plus free medical for the next 50 or 60 years. So at least they won't be working side by side with the no pension crowd for long.This unfunded pension liability is huge. The taxpayers including the newbies can pay it.

0,"If memory serves you've posted under a different name in the past; at any rate, your screeds against Crossan over the dogs thing are as predictable as rain.  I'm not sure what you're going on about.  I'd think you'd be more exercised over what the Romans did to Jesus when he was alive than when he was dead. Presumably God Almighty could raise Jesus regardless of his human condition post mortem.  <<there's NO defense for his ludicrous claim>>  Yes, there is, as I mentioned before. Crossan may be wrong, but he didn't dream up this stuff in a vacuum. If the Romans permitted Jesus's body to be removed from the cross before sundown on the day of his crucifixion, it would (probably) have been unusual. Even if the Romans deferred to Jewish sensibilities over crucifixion victims, they may have been less accommodating when it came to seditionists. The whole point of the public spectacle was to discourage insurgents and terrify the populace into submission.

This could cost us dearly in 2018 and 2020.

Contrary to popular opinion, the Pope does not possess the authority to change the sacraments.  If the Anglican rite was defect, so is its twin in the NO.  Whether or not a Rite is valid is not BECAUSE a pope said so, it is for the circumstances for which it is declared so.  An invalid form is invalid no matter what century we live in.  So the question begs asking, are any of the """"presbyters"""" installed using the new """"Rite"""" validly ordained?  And if not, they can't confect the sacraments.

An op ed is an editorial that is not produced by a newspaper's Editorial Board or any other staff member and is not a news report. The op refers to the fact that it was traditionally published on the opposite page of the papers Editorials and Letters to the Editor.  In doing so, it is recognized that there are no clear lines between analysis and opinion.  Just as I had the additional reading comprehension to recognize that when the author of the Op Ed writes """"Looking at coastal flood and storm-surge protection"""" when starting a paragraph, he is talking about the Texas coast in general not Houston specifically.

I also have given many basic cooking lessons over the years and part of the lesson is costing the ingredients.  Showing a young person that you can make 6 servings of Shepherds pie for less than one happy meal at McDs is an eye opener.  But I find fewer and fewer people know how to cook or they think it has to be hugely time consuming.

You are right about the huge backlash that looms over the Medjugorje situation, not least because of the huge industry that has grown up around these claims.

Canada had over 100 officers who worked with the US developing the original invasion planning and also worked with them during the actual invasion.  We also had several personnel assigned to US ground force units that did participate in actual combat as part of the US/Canada exchange program.  Combine that with the numerous ships that were assigned to contain any Iraqi forces trying to escape by sea as well as offer logistic and supply transport support.

Most people are perfectly capable of managing their own portfolio, but many of course choose not to because of a lack of interest or time.

Two police cars went zipping by as the the man began to walk he was struck by the third. There was no way the officer driving could have seen him or maneuvered past him at the speed he was going.""""  The officer stopped and administered aid. Accidents happen. Dark clothes, dark street, late at night, victim not in crosswalk, all a recipe for disaster. Sorry the guy got hurt, but officers was responding to an emergency call with appropriate speed. Officers were responding to weapons disturbance, before it turned into an active shooting. Other drivers pulled over, so why is it this guy was in the road?? Victim is responcible for his actions as well, he obviously wasn't paying attention to traffic.

Think about cheap Chinese goods that many retailers rely on (Walmart in particular) or vehicles made in Mexico.  It is simple math.  If you raise the cost of goods by 20%, the retailer will raise their prices by around 20% to protect their profit margins.

Nearly 60% of minimum wage earners are between the ages of 15-24 so many of these people live at home and live off the largeness of their parent(s). This increase isn't going to see the welfare roles shrinking, it isn't going to suddenly see the marginalized in society rise up, get a job and become a giver instead of a taker because everything else in their lives will remain the same. I like your line about underwriting labour costs.  I say prove it that your taxes are underwriting labour  costs for private small businesses.  I know we do underwrite every Gov't employee through their pensions, medical, employer share of payroll deductions, etc. so how is that right and yet paying higher costs so a business can recoup an increase if 32% in operating costs wrong?

But what is more shocking is our current administrator is refusing to investigate or acknowledge it. Maybe because it helped them win the election, or if Trump turns a blind eye to it, Putin will let him build more hotels and golf courses in Russia.  Instead this administration is spending millions going after, made-up, non-existent illegal voters (who all voted Democratic!), or are attacking women, science (they don't like),  workers, and the environment.

We have missed very important chances to improve passenger train service.  If the interstates had incorporated dedicated passenger rail it would be great.   I can't see a pathway that will get us thriving intercity rail.  Maybe the best option is to design bus trains having multiple linked sections and train like accommodations that run on the interstates and connect directly to mass transit sites in the cities they serve.  Alternatively, nationalize all the nations tracks (not the rail companies) so as to maintain and deploy them in the public interest (like the interstates).

I haven't seen this myself, and I won't; but I believe my friends's report.  If Priests for Life is to survive as a Catholic ministry, Fr. Pavone needs to resign or be removed. The organization must submit to ecclesial authority in a way that makes it accountable in all the ordinary ways we demand of other groups: finances, fund raising, strategy, tactics, and messaging.  Cardinal Dolan apparently doesn't want them; they should relocate to a diocese that accepts them and they should submit to the authority of that bishop.

The reality is that that the cost of living and taxation have far outpaced increases in income, leaving average people with less and less disposable income.

While it's true that the financial elite have done  very well, main street has not - they steadily drop further and further behind, the middle class continues to disappear, the ranks of the have nots swells and the ranks of the well offs shrinks.

0,"No, that's not what Republicans believe. We believe the *federal* government has limited powers, delineated by the Constitution, and that everything else should go to the state government or the people. Using your examples, a conservative would say that the postal service is specifically mentioned in the Constitution (art. 1, section 8, clause 7) and therefore a proper role for the federal government. Most would say that regulation of food and creation of interstate highways are generally roles of the federal government under Congress' power to regulate commerce among the several states. I personally am not a fan of how broadly the Commerce Clause is interpreted because states are not allowed to regulate interstate trucking, which I believe should be a state function.

It favors the spread of crop pests and could harm animals and mankind.  I think we should tackle the problem overpopulation.

0,"The only question being asked here is this....Do parents have a right to know?  Children are not afforded the same charter rights protections that adults are.  For example, the right to unreasonable search and seizure.  If I want to search my sons room, I will.  If I want to search my sons computer, I will.  If I want to take the phone away, I will. That is my right as a parent, to raise my child as I see fit.  Do parents have a right to know where their minor is at all times and what they are doing?  Who they are hanging out with, who their friends are, Would you be branded an irresponsible parent if you didn't?  This will fall along partisan fault lines.  Liberals prefer nanny-stateism and rely heavily on the state to raise their children.  Conservatives are mostly opposed to nanny-stateism and embrace personal responsibility for their children on a far different level then liberals do.  Does a parents right to know supersede a child's perceived right to privacy.

In either case, Nixon's presidency would for all practical purposes ended at that point.

I would resent such a commitment to military build-up if I thought it an appeasement of Trump. But the reality is that Putin and Trump have together made the world a more dangerous place. And so it is not unreasonable to bolster our military spending - in part to discharge our NATO obligations to countries like Latvia but also, as noted by the minister, to help defend Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic.  The need for 5,000 or 6,000 new recruits is also good news for Canadian millennials and the parents who'd like to have their basements back. We need a much more comprehensive response to our horrendous youth unemployment problem of course, but equipping more of them with the skills and confidence that come with military training is not a bad start.

At the time, Oregon law required the noncustodial parent to pay child support regardless of gender or need (I assume this is still true).  In our situation, I was fine financially and had no need of child support payments to care for our kids. My ex was without an income and was barely able to support herself, let alone pay child support. So I ended up petitioning the judge to remove the support requirement.  This turned out to be a hugely problematic thing to do, although I was successful in the end. I realize that my experience is just anecdotal, but it left me with the distinct impression that gender was not a serious factor in child support awards.

He seemed both poorly informed about the subject, confusing the target rate with the target range, and not at all interested in having a discussion about it, telling me dismissively that if interest rates moved up people would have trouble making their mortgage payments. It didn’t seem to occur to him that a too-high target rate of inflation had played a role in creating this mountain of mortgage debt. Lisa Raitt was just the opposite: well-informed on monetary policy, and open to discussing reforms even if she refrained from endorsing a lower target rate of inflation.

0,"There are no 'losses' relative to the US dollar.  The exchange rate between two independent currencies is ultimately a function of purchasing power parity.  and moves very generally as a function of interest rate parity.   Further, the currency markets are subject to high volatility and speculators and rarely reflect the actual relationship in purchasing power parity; however, over longer term and particularly in the case of the USD/CAD where barriers are low and volume of trade high, on average the exchange rate is within a narrow range about the actual relative to other currency pairs.  Currencies are not commodities or financial investments, they are currencies; and as such the media's articulation of exchange rate in terms of daily gains or losses is amateur and unsophisticated.  The more accurate articulation is that a decrease in the value of CAD relative to USD reflects an excess supply of CAD in the open market, or less of a demand for CAD in exchange for USD.

0,"The British/Dutch invaders were responsible for massacring bushmen. The last license to hunt Bushmen was reportedly issued in Namibia by the South African government in 1936.  By the end of the 18th century, only 150 years after the arrival of the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope, thousands of Bushmen (San) had been shot and killed, and many more were forced to work for their colonial captors. The new British government vowed to stop the fighting. They hoped to “civilize” the Bushmen by encouraging them to adopt a more agricultural lifestyle but were unsuccessful. By the 1870s the last Bushmen of the Cape were hunted to extinction. Other Bushman groups were able to survive the European encroachment despite continued threats. The last license to hunt Bushmen was reportedly issued in Namibia by the South African government in 1936.

I never had a desire to know my birth mother and found the majority of non-adopted people could not understand this and told me that I was wrong. Also, often when I mentioned that I was adopted, it was meet with pity. One woman said that if she found out that her brother was adopted she would be devasted because he no longer would be her brother. Another said adoption is dangerous because you never know what you'll get stuck with. Even my beloved had said that I have no idea what family is because I don't have any. I feel very secure with my parents, we had our challenges, but it's not because I'm adopted. That being said, I did find my birth mother a few years ago because my teenage son asked me to as he was born with a genetic disorder. It turns out that I like her very much. But my parents will always be my parents. She was just the vehicle to get me to them.

0,"There is talk below about the possibility that states will acquire the ability to """"declare bankruptcy"""" which they do not currently have.  The discussion below is about legislative action by Congress acceded to by the President.  However, while I am no Constitutional scholar, I believe it is not merely a matter of legislation, but of the Constitution, which explicitly states that the states shall not impair contracts.  This provision apparently was to keep the new states from deciding not to pay their debts from before the Constitution became effective.  My understanding is that there has been Supreme Court case law related to this.  So, it might be very difficult institute State bankruptcy without a Constitutional amendment.  Furthermore, this would be a radical and very dangerous step.  It would forever change the relationship of the federal government to the States.  Essentially, they would become wards of the federal government.  I for one hope we never go there.

As long as the first exists, the third will thrive.  The bishop has made it clear that the first is not a moral stance in the Catholic Church.  Of course, there will be those who say, but abortion!

0,"The roughly 1/3 of tax filers who pay no income tax are not well served by the economy.  Those who fall into the top marginal rate category have shelters to reduce the amount of tax payable and the higher the income the greater the opportunity..  The usual argument against taxing the wealthy is twofold, reduced incentive and the revenue gained would not slay the debt.  It is not unreasonable to assume that excessive incentives encourage reckless behaviour and are destructive to the economy.  Peter Drucker amongst others thought that incomes exceeding 20x the average would be inimical to capitalism.  Since the median tax filer earns roughly $30,000- this would translate into a maximum level of $600,000- for top earners which is not unreasonable.  It can also be argued that excessive income weakens democracy through the buying of influence.  Reducing the income gap, not increasing it, should be the aim of taxation policy.

The public debt when  Obama took office was right at 10 trillion, it is now close to 21 trillion. My math skills are not so bad that I recognize that increase is over 100%, not 75%. Of course, Bush2 increased the debt about the same percentage by increasing it 5 trillion, which Obama and the left were telling everyone how evil he was for doing so. As far as Reagan is concerned, did you conveniently forget what you stated at the beginning of your comment? Only congress can make the laws. Even with all of the screaming about Reagan vetoing almost every spending rider the democrats attached to every bill, they still managed to get Reagan to sign enough bills to spend 10% more than he requested every year but one. Try to guess which year that was?

He will call upon those people (who are now in power in their own places and who have vested interests in keeping Zuma in charge here) to control the unruly masses in SA. Every single person will be the poorer for this ruthless power in the false name of ANC protection. The external call will be made within the next two years. 2019 is too risky for him. Dec 2017 will not happen for the same reason. Too risky. BP KPMG and others are a type of people's justice that almost distract from the larger wanton abuse of people in this country.

0,"What the ambassador to Canad needs to admit is that the problem is Russia's threats to its small neighbors. Stalin and the Soviet Union are both dead - get over it. The irritant is not Canada's minor role in the area, it is the failure of the Russian administration to properly manage its internal affairs. Russia should be the bright light both economically and culturally in eastern Europe. Instead corruption, petty internal regional jealousies, preference for control vs. innovation, and the high continuing high rates of alcoholism still plague the country. The threats to Russia are all pretty much internal rather than external. Unfortunately, the response is to focus all attention on the mirage of perceived external threats; not uncommon for dictatorial countries and old style third world economies. But then, why do something innovative and forward thinking (to help the average Russian) when you can continue to enjoy the pampered life of a diplomat and peddle the same old fictions.

0,"The part of Iowa from which I came was populated by a massive influx of German Catholic immigrants after the civil war. When they arrived, they did not speak English and were resistant to learning. They published German language newspapers, and generally overran the white settlers who first laid claim to the area. There German Catholic culture became the culture of the area.  This story repeats with many different immigration waives all over the country. Thus American culture is immigrant culture. There is no singular American culture. It is a patchwork of multiculturalism.  Spanish was the first European language spoken in what would become the US. America itself is named after an Italian. Colorado is a Spanish name. The list goes on. The US should at least have Spanish as an additional official language.  Not sure what you're going on about with the stabbings and all that but it is clear that white males commit the vast majority of random mass murder in the US.

These credits incentivize investment by subsidizing the cost of certain expenditures. The $8 per barrel credit is not part of the $700 million (or whatever the actual # is) that we owe to those that have earned credits. Moreover, the level of the per barrel credit depends on the price of oil - the credit goes down as prices go up.

We have people here who have zero respect for laws, personal responsibility, and human life.  When I say life I mean even a persons ability to live successfully.  If you're going into Carrs regularly and stealing you're going to cost some unknowing cashier their job due to corporate losses. We see the news in regards to shootings or violent crimes.  What we don't see are the high number of thefts, vandalism, and other """"online"""" reports. Since they don't even want you to call with a non violent crime anymore.  This wave of crime in such a small community is literally happening hourly and it's more than we can handle.

They need to be held accountable for incidents like this. Cabbies operate in these types of environments and not only bar break but residential like in this case too.

Whatever solutions the federal government and provinces arrive at must work within sustainable budget practices - we cannot have health care taking an ever increasing percentage of federal and provincial expenditures, nor are ever increasing taxes sustainable.  I suspect that long term we'll need to have a mix of private and public health-care.  We need to find a solution that will be sustainable sooner rather than later if we are to avoid having to find such a solution in the midst of a crisis.  If partial private health-care is necessary, then the sooner we start, the more carefully we can implement such changes, and the less likely we are to lose the principle that people get the health-care they need, regardless of their ability to pay for it.

Additionally, we must be able to point to and reference a source or text where our moral compass derives it's definition so that we can discern and turn from error. The events of Charlotsville have illustrated how something can be perfectly legal and yet still be perfectly odious, reprehensible and immoral. It's immoral not because it's illegal but because the text of our moral code declares it to be so and our consciences confirm it to be true. It's the same reason why the Obergefell decision must be decried as the odious and immoral decision that it is, legal though it may be.

Once you have leveled the playing field for all types of income by recognizing appropriate deductions you can then apply the desired progressive tax rates to meet your social objectives.

Our lax immigration laws, a complete lack of control over ownership of property has allowed the immigration consulting industry in this country to offer the ideal landing ground where criminals can park both their money and their families.

But thinking that private for-profit providers will generate better, more cost-efficient service when their expenses will be the same PLUS investors will want a 15% return on their investment every year simply strains credulity beyond the breaking point.

The same goes for the people who didn't do a thing, but believed Sanders was campaigning on a better message.  Please continue living in the past where gaming the party, shaming, and bullying are effective methods of controlling the evolution of public sentiment.  I go to meetings, I see how hard it is to get people excited, and to get them to physically participate.  I see how old the hard core reliable people are.  Here was candidate who was going to bring young people into the party, but, no.  ...go home cook rice!

Maybe Obama would not have been Senator if the divorce papers were not made public after the press sought their release (where did you get the idea they were """"leaked""""?) So your hidden accusation is one of illegitimacy.  Even if there was divine intervention into Obama's election, he proved himself in the Senate. If he had been incompetent his fellow Senators would have not held such esteem. Your second issue is one of hypocrisy, very common with people who think an attack on hypocrisy counters a claim. It does not. It just says: Person A did something wrong. And so did Person B. Thus both were wrong. Of course the divorce documents were legally released, so the two are not comparable.

Suddenly, jgd777 then decided that he'd be OK with the government mandating that people carry catastrophic health insurance (it was pointed out that if he was going to favor people not having to buy insurance, then those people should be on the hook for every dime, and no more bankruptcy protection).

0,"It has nothing to do with people.  The AGW conjecture is based upon a radiative greenhouse effect caused by gases with LWIR absorption bands.  One problem with this concept is that good absorbers are also good radiators so the sc called greenhouse gases do not hang to the heat energy they absorb.  Anyway heat transfer by conduction and convection dominates over heat tranafer by LWIR absorption band radiation in the troposphere where all of our climate happens.  The reality is that the radiant greenhouse effect has not been observed anywhere in the solar system.  It is science fiction hence the AGW conjecture is science fiction.

There is not a snowflake's chance in hell that anyone's mind is going to be changed from long-held positions, and the nastiness that ensues from attempts is always worse than the original disagreement.

0,"The rape shield provisions usually preclude questioning the alleged victim about sexual activity with people other than the accused. I generally don't have a problem with that. To take an extreme case, suppose a woman willingly had sex with ten different men in the 24 hours before the accused is alleged to have sexually assaulted her; the activity with the other men is not evidence that she consented to sex with the accused, and is rightfully excluded. Also, evidence that a woman consented to sex with the accused on Thursday is usually not admissible if the accusation is assault on Friday. On the other hand, if the victim had consensual sex with the accused AFTER the alleged assault, that is usually relevant and will generally be admitted.  The result is that an extremely explicit sext from the alleged victim to somebody other than the accused will almost certainly be inadmissible; the same sext addressed to the accused probably will be admitted.

It is a convenience to try to make a distinction between matter and spirit, but it is a limit of our human ability to perceive beyond the physical.  God is bigger than that.  I believe that it is the community praying together, recognizing their bond and love together with Christ, that makes it possible for some to better realize His presence.  It isn't some magic of the priest that makes Christ present, but the joining of those who love Christ that makes the difference.  Christ's  presence is also realized in quiet, private, contemplative prayer.  The Eucharist is not a magic show, as someone I recently read so aptly put it.  Christ is present were two or more are gathered in His name, no priest required, although I like ritual and group rituals require a leader.

I spent most of my career in universities in both the US and Canada, and I managed to spend almost all of my time in the company of people who were reasonable and thoughtful.

In my view, that description applies generally to the approach that both the Protestant evangelicals and the Catholic integralists take.  Now a proper integralist approach will only devolve into a sterile integralistic rigorism when the noncoercive soft powers of moral enculturation, creedal inculturation, pastoral accommodation and dialogical communication are forsaken for the hard powers of legal and political coercion.

I especially value the first sentence of the first Constitution he proclaimed in 1840: """"God has made of one blood all races of people to dwell upon this Earth in unity and blessedness.""""  Unfortunately, the entire momentum for erecting the new statue in Thomas Square is to push for a modern return of Hawaiian independence (i.e., secession from USA) by celebrating the return of sovereignty in 1843 following a British takeover (used as metaphor for hoped-for return of sovereignty when USA withdraws from Hawaii).  And the demand is for Hawaiian racial supremacy in a newly independent Hawaii (just like KKK and the white nationalists on mainland).  You can see that the Hawaiian activists do not want full equality for """"non-Hawaiians"""" -- see how they do racial cleansing of Hawaiian history, removing white heroes of the Kingdom (Judd, Richards) from holiday celebrations.

Let's not fail to mention the not unimportant impediment the constitution poses where these matters are concerned, which must surely be inconvenient to Trudeau, who's prone to wrap himself in the sanctity of that document when it serves him to do so. There is no route for aboriginal independence under the current version of the constitution, which subsumes the Proclamation of 1763, whereby Crown sovereignty is asserted across all Canadian lands. And the Supreme Court recently threw cold water on the fantasy of an aboriginal veto over development. The UNDRIP is at best an aspirational instrument and the big concern should be that Trudeau is creating expectations that can't be met.

Working for the government you can goof off for 30 years then enjoy another 30 years of retirement paradise with a generous pension and great health care benefits.  In business the owner or the boss provides leadership and makes decisions.  In Hawaii's government the public workers' unions and construction industry make all the major decisions and dictate what the elected officials do.  This is what is known as """"the inmates running the asylum.""""  It also helps explain why we are spending billions on a useless rail system but can't keep the Pali Highway paved.

Whether it arrives in the deep red suburbs of Atlanta is another matter entirely, and I, for one, am not expecting that district to suddenly turn blue simply because of Trump. Holding up that particular district as a national bellwether seems to me an unreliable indicator of where the nation as a whole stands in relation to Donald Trump. The 2018 midterms will be a more reliable indicator, and they can't come soon enough to rid us of this pestilence that has sullied the office of the presidency, probably for good. Lord knows, we can't rely on this particular Republican-led congress to do that for us.

And it exists in spite of the arguments used in the dubia, which were heard during the 1st synod but still rejected by a majority of the voters.  The Synod and Exhortation are steps in the process of clarifying the doctrine. The dubia questions are opposed to this, espousing a position that has been rejected.

0,"The definition of """"pro-life"""" is """"different in different parts of the country,"""" Day told CNS.  You can say that again. Because of that, I think the new chair of the DNC should not be so quick to speak in such absolute terms regarding the complex issues surrounding abortion. I'm of the belief that the Democratic Party is big enough, wide enough, and strong enough to accommodate many views on this issue, unlike the Republican Party, which tolerates only one, firm absolute position. As many have said before, being pro-choice doesn't necessarily mean being pro-abortion. Speaking only for myself, I would like to see abortion remain a safe, legal medical procedure in order to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by pregnancy. Such cases may be rare, but they do happen, and the law should take them into account. The bishops may make no distinction between a fetus and a mother with a family, but I do, and I know how I would behave if I had to make a choice as a legal caregiver.

Second, the police may decide the offence is too minor to bother a prosecutor with. Third, a prosecutor may decide the offence is too minor to bother a court with.

Years ago his office overhead was $200 an hour, so that was how much he had to bill before he made any income at all. Then the local hospital chose to start using """"hospitalists"""" to manage inpatient stays, so he wasn't even able to bill for his own patients' inpatient hospital management. But the orthopedist across the street can pretty much write their own checks for a 5 minute visit. I don't see how primary care providers stay in business like that.

Without water, California agricultural land doesn't exist.  With empty reservoirs caused by natural climate cycles, probably exacerbated by human-caused global warming, that water has to be pumped from the ground, and those ancient reservoirs, with little to no operating recharge, are sinking fast.  Even with its huge population, far and away the largest user of water is agriculture, not domestic use.  California is going to have to regulate water mining, or lose that limited resource.  That means regulation of business, which Nunes opposes.  So resource abuse is political, not weather or climate.
