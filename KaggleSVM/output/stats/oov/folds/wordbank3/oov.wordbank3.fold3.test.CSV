0,"From the reactions to Ken's comment, it appears that the Liberals are paying people to make unrealistic comments. Hydro bills have doubled in 8 years. The rate of increase shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.  People should make every effort to reduce consumption to counter the increase.  Even if you have cut consumption 30% - 40% over this time, your bill is still higher than it was. And higher than it should be.  It is faulty economic policies of the reigning party over 12 years that have us in the position we are.  This is well documented.

0,"1) Your understanding, and thus your interpretation, of the 1st Amendment is flawed.  Would you be surprised to learn there was State sponsored religion in a number of States after the adoption of the Constituion?  And while the flawed incorporation doctrine adopted by SCOTUS may currently hold sway, that doesn't permit the government to be hostile to religion by excluding it from programs such as education supported by public taxation.  The purpose of the taxation is to provide every child with an education.  If a religious school is supporting the public good by providing an education to children, why should the government be able to be hostile and withhold public funds raised for the exclusive purpose of educating children, in many instances serving the poorest children in the community and yielding superior educations for those most in need of a good education to help them escape poverty?

0,"Drilling in ANWR is not """"a human rights issue."""" Further, it is not for international organizations to weigh in on how Alaskans choose to manage their resources.  We've heard for years from those who argue that drilling in ANWR would make a negligible impact on global oil production. Now many of those same voices argue instead that drilling in ANWR would significantly contribute to global warming. Can't have it both ways.  The fact is that drilling will have a meaningful and measurable impact on our economy by creating jobs and by providing significant federal revenue sharing to the State of Alaska.

0,"BLM's co-founder - Yusra Khogali is an unapologetic racist. Her shameful, inflammatory rhetoric is indicative of the BLM movement in Toronto. Calling whites """"sub-human"""" and white skin being a """"genetic defect"""" - and tweeting """"Plz Allah give me strength to not cuss/kill these men and white folks out here today. Plz plz plz"""". Now this racist organization has been allowed to desecrate the Pride movement 0 thanks largely to spineless politicians who continue to refuse to confront BLM for what they are - an unhelpful, racist, anti-police fringe group that deserves nothing but disdain.

In truth things have never been better.   Misery can be a self fulfilling prophesy.  Many sad gays are so self absorbed in their own little lives on Church St,  they forget there is a big wide world out there that doesn't give a damn if they are gay.  For them, being gay is a ball and chain of self pity, and they expect the rest of the world to care. I see it in the younger generation who side  with BLM,  a symptom of that self loathing.

0,"Governor Walker and at least 138,000 Alaskan voters want this pipeline built if at all possible. We are making great progress.  We voted to create a state (ANGDA/AGDC) agency to give it the best shot we can to conclusion. We should have the final go-no go answer by June as the agency and governor stated, as there has been plenty of interest by overseas customers just across the pacific, as is plainly evident.  That the Governor has partisan critics like the oily Senator Giessel is no surprise to readers or Alaskan voters who see the ADDITIONAL promise of delivered gas to the state and it`s people and businesses, as well as the jobs and revenue such a LEGACY project will bring to the last frontier. It`s no surprise your still a critic of the Governor.  I would guess a vote today would support the Governor and the marketing effort still, by far. I Hope you and Rhyner and Giessel and the other partisan oil shills in the legislature like crow, this old Alaskan will enjoy you choking on it.

0,"I wish that the Dispatch would have covered the recent decision by the Alaska Supreme Court because it was about two tribes or maybe it was corporations that were suing each other. I was very interested in knowing more because it is a very different ruling than in a previous case about 40 years ago. I do not know how to find it on the Court page. Wasn't there a case about 20 years ago that went all the way to the US Supreme Court over tribal sovereignty? It was argued for the tribe  by a young Native woman attorney ? 50 + years ago, my father sued his tribe over a piece of land that he had been allocated that was seized under the public domain law (something like that) so Interstate 40 could be built. He had built a house on it and wanted money for that plus a new allotment. It took him about 10 or more years in Federal Court to eventually win but by then he had spent more money in attorney fees then what he got for the house. It was suppose to be a """"landmark case"""" at the time.

0,"Trump thinks he owns America and hundreds of millions of people because he the President.  He is very, very, addicted to power and control like Ferdinand Marcos.

"
0,"As I've been saying for some time - the only way out of this impasse is for the legislature to put the oil credits and state budget on the table and cut dollar for dollar until someone says uncle.  We can afford to cut some oil credits - if there's not enough money in oil up there when prices go back up - so be it. Who knows - maybe then we'll get an income tax on all the money leaving the state.  And when I read that we spent 300k to hire an administrator at the UAF with a fancy title of chancellor - you realize the state can probably get a whole lot more serious about budget cutting.

Dressed up in scary costumes with hoods and masks, members rode about at night threatening and frightening blacks. They demanded that blacks either vote Democrat or not vote at all.

She has been inundated with offer to join boards, I alone have been asked for her private coordinates several times.  She is already on some boards and can join more.  It is not at the board level therefore we need to begin, but in high schools and universities, in supporting maternity leave and other women's issues.  Perhaps the number of board positions is a good long term metric of success, but let's pull women up, encourage them to take STEM courses and support them through their whole careers.

0,"T0 clarify, the effects of SO2 releases mainly result is acid rain S02>H2So4 (sulfuric acid), which acidifies soil and water, lessening the efficiencies of the water to support life and hold oxygen. It also causes release of other toxic metals at lower pH. Venezuala is poor because of poor government (graft) and nationalizing their oil production, Saudi not so much. Saudi did cut back on government payout and even while pumping at record rates they're still at a deficit.  Russia is also pumping at record rates at the same time emptying one sovereign wealth fund and will have to tap their last one in 2017. As for the global oil price, the higher prices ($100+ per barrel) made marginal fields profitable and they keep pumping to get  a return on investment. US crude imports are near the same levels they have been for over 20 years. The """"glut"""" we're experiencing is the result of overproduction at the same time the world economy is slowing.

Listen to the music leading into news shows and segments.  Or the breathless headlines.  Or the ever-negative position-pushing pundits...  They used to say sex sells, and it does.  But I think come election time, fear dominates.  That's on us, no matter what party...  If WE Can look past fear-based manipulation, we take their tools away.  Maybe then we can have real discussions on real issues about what's best for our country - all of us.

The Blowhard is talking about putting resources on the front lines.  And it must be a joke when France is asking for Canada's help.

That he seems to be struggling with why he can't just use nukes. That he would be terrible at international relations (that's just an opinion). His dumb dumb plan to build a wall that would cost a fortune and would solve nothing.  Look, all Cruz said in his justification for why he is voting for Trump is a pledge he made to vote for the candidate, and that he won't vote for Hillary. He is the one not speaking to the issues.

I am glad to see the NCR do a piece on the beginning of the Resistance...i.e. The Women's March....think it should be noted that similar marches occurred nation and worldwide. In my area Oakland CA I assure you that women of every color and cultural background were present it was NOT a whites only deal contrary to the articles description of some 5 folks taken somewhere in DC...and there were a large number of men as well. My experience of these marches and I had family and friends in DC, Oakland, LA, Eugene, Portland and many other locations...was that these folks were horrified by Trump for many diverse reasons..a large number had never been involved in a demonstration ever in their lives...and sorting these guys out into organizations that spoke to their concerns was a huge challenge. The development very shortly after the march of the Indivisible Manual (read it) and the groups was an answer to where to place these marchers.....

One must pay market rates to attract and retain high performing employees. It one pays peanuts then one gets monkeys.

In the private sector that's generally not a problem and easily remedied when it surfaces, but in the city its a huge problem. In that regard we are not getting our money's worth from the city. Anchorage citizens should be rightly upset about drunk vagrants downtown and on street corners, rampant lawlessness in some sections of the city, homeless camps on public property, a bloated and poor performing school administration and a mayor who says our choices are snow removal or crime prevention.

0,"""""The final national electoral vote count would not reflect how the nation voted. That’s bad accounting and makes for inaccurate history."""" This is only true if you look to the details of the electoral vote for history or accuracy. If the NPVIC passes that would be a pointless exercise since the electoral college will have been effectively circumvented. For history and accuracy you will look at the public voting data for the country and see that the final result does indeed reflect how the nation voted. Just because some obsolete intermediate step doesn't show the whole picture doesn't matter at all, just like you don't know how many steps your computer goes through to calculate any particular number. No one cares what votes the Oregonian senator submits as long as the right person is elected. If Oregon and some other state were to agree to always switch, that wouldn't matter at all since there would be no difference.

Thus: - Climate change is increasing because of increased CO2 rate of change - Human activities have increased the CO2 rate of change beyond natural variation - Ergo, human activities have increased the rate of climate change.

0,"Ask the  incumbent state legislators & their opponents about the overly generous per diem payments those in office arranged for themselves. For example, why do they get a lump sum payment of what John Coghill estimated at around $7,000/month, when their ACTUAL per diem expenses are far less? Why do legislators who own real property in Juneau and live there get any per diem at all (Egan, Munoz, Kito, Ledoux, Josephson, +)?  If military members and, according to Peter Micchiche those who work for Conoco Phillips, are reimbursed for only actual expenses while on temporary duty away from home, then why do Alaska legislators consider themselves entitled to much more in monthly per diem payments? Why do some legislators (like Josephson) use per diem money to purchase investment property in Juneau. Why do Liz Vasquez & Sam Kito use extra per diem income to makeup for lost income required by being legislators?  The math: $5,000(extra) x 60(members) = $150,000/month or $600,000/regular sessio

0,"I am not a scientist; I rely on my doctor to provide good advice. I can not see any legitimate reason why drug companies would give money to doctors. This is an expense which is included in the drug's price. I think there are two things that need to be done: doctor drug panel should not receive payments from drug companies ever; and 2) there needs to be an independent reassessment of when drugs are recommended. I can not understand why this has not already been done.

0,"Those may be the facts and i don't disagree with them but housing prices where i live have almost doubled in 3 years so even if we have the lowest personal income tax for those earning that amount, it really doesn't come close to bridging the gap between wages and the ability to purchase a home, condo or townhome.

While the judicial process is an adversarial one, it is predicated on the notion that deciders, i.e. judges and jurors represent the full spectrum of responsible citizens.  The DA's action to remove Mooney from all criminal cases without independent review sabotages the notion of impartiality which is defined by collective input from diverse players.  There is no such thing as absolute impartiality.  It comes from collective representation of mainstream societal views.  Mooney apparently did not believe everything the DA wanted her to.  Mooney apparently dared to question positions taken by Perlow.  Mooney should question Perlow's positions.  Perlow is out for Perlow.  She is scored on convictions not on justice.  In my own view, it is Perlow who should be removed from the system.  Back scenes manipulation of judges should be a crime in which case Perlow could experience the """"justice"""" she and her tame judges regularly dish out.

Trump engaged in this rhetoric, and it was fair criticism on his part when Obama was in office.  The tables have turned now. And the same yardstick may be applied to him.  Two wrongs don't make a right. Trump should have called out the enemy parading naked in the streets of Charlottesville instead of acting like Obama.  The KKK, its progeny, and anyone who wears motorcycle armor to intimidate and terrorize the public, are in most books, bonafide terrorists. And it's fair to suspect that Trump shares an alliance with this bunch that collectively calls itself the alt-right. And a not-too-narrow slice of the alt-right spectrum consists of Nazi wannabes.

That makes no sense at all.   Cancel the carbon tax but still fight global warming? How are you going to do that effectively if you don't put a cost on polluting?   A big tax credit to encourage parents to keep their kids out of school? How will you ensure kids are getting an adequate education from do-it-yourself amateurs? It sounds like a really bad idea.   Resume Harper's unquestioning support for right-wing Israeli governments in creating a """"greater Israel"""" and oppressing Palestinians? That's an inhumane and unworthy idea.

0,"For the last couple of weeks, I have gotten the impression that, buoyed by the poll numbers, Djou made a strategic gamble to put his whole plan out on the table for voters to consider in the primary. So, again flipping through the book of Panos, he pulled out the BRT conversion and the transfer to bus option at Middle St. And then he thought that may be enough to get him over the 50%, because in his mind, it was unquestionable at that point that the voters wanted the current Mayor back at this point.  And then the results came in, and surprise, the voters were thinking different.  Now we have a race where the challenger, having expended all of his ideas, needs to come up with new ones, and fast. In my opinion, unless he comes out with a blockbuster idea  - like finding a billion bucks to cover the expenses that is guaranteed money in the bank, Djou has nothing more to move the needle in my opinion.  Meanwhile, the current mayoral occupant is still there, despite this gamble.

0,"The value I saw in Republican candidates was a steady, rational leadership style.  George Romney with his Detroit background interested me for instance.  I believe in well informed leadership that values and respects those they lead down to the 'least of us', (Jack Kemp, George H.W. Bush).  I understand that 'the masses' can be sold almost any lie.   They are often trapped in a narrow personal life that can't and doesn't understand the nations needs, much less the world.   'The People' are not a deliberative body.  From my perspective, the down side of unfettered capitalism is lust for power by the individual, lacking empathy for the broader community.   Most certainly NOT true of ALL wealthy people.  But history, American history included, is ripe with ugly abuse of the weak by the powerful.   It doesn't matter if your talking about the Biblical wisdom or, a behavioral study - unchecked power will lead to abuse, democracy will collapse.  As always, thanks for your thoughtful post.

0,"<<That's unhinged>>  That's dishonest. Donald Trump pranced around the country for years promoting the racist drivel of birtherism.  He did it with the tacit (and sometimes not so tacit) assent of the Republican party and its leaders (with one or two notable exceptions.) And he built his political career on it. Moreover, Mitch McConnell unabashedly affirmed that his mission as President Obama began his first term was to make sure that he would only have one term.  Not a word nor a hint to suggest that the good of the country was more important than limiting Obama to one term. It was personal.  And for a lot of them it was about race. To deny that is dishonest.

No one can possibly call themselves a feminist and ignore the reality of Sharia Law and the utmost oppression of women.  How can people like Kathleen Wynne for example, allow herself to be covered and sent to the back of the mosque, or stand in front of pamphlets that inside the folds says homosexuality is a sin punishable by death?  Your article actually tries to lay blame for rape on feminism.  I don't think you can become more backward thinking without your knuckles dragging on the ground and a club in your hand.

When you are sick or in a car accident you can't price shop even if getting comparative prices were possible. Insurance companies could compete if government set the ground rules, which Obamacare did to some extent, such as setting minimum standards for coverage, no pre-existing condition exclusions, etc. But without some """"price fixing"""" (i.e., setting maximum prices and some standard fees) removing prohibition on price negotiation, and getting away from fee-for-service, insurance premiums (for the same coverage) will continue to rise, no matter what Mitch accomplishes or fails to accomplish.

0,"The last five Canadian ministers of finance have come from the Toronto financial community (Goodale worked for Martin). The BoC was designed to be independent; it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Canadian banking industry. Just look at the composition of its board. No regulator in Canada possesses subpoena power. As a result, all restitution requires legal victory, which, even the superior courts, have little record of producing. Total enforcement, supervision and financial restitution in Canada is less than one percent of industry income annually. Administration is a cost of doing business; no underwriter would ever accept so little premium for an insured risk. Insiders and politicians are hand in glove. Basel is a talk shop with no ability to effect policy; national supervisors frequently opt out. Finance is an int'l influence-peddling scheme.

After 50 years of ideas that did not appeal to a sufficient number of Canadians for the NDP to achieve electoral success nationally, they decided the only way to win would be not to change their message, but to change the rules.  I will note the hypocrisy inherent of the NDP never pushing for PR and legislating for the same without a referendum in provinces where they do regularly win majorities.  Apparently first-past-the-post works fine in those electoral situations. Now however, I believe Mr. Broadbent has gone past the point of being self-serving to being evil .  You need to change the system so Canadians can never elect someone Mr. Broadbent disapproves of.  150 years of Canadians electing parties and leaders of the broad middle-of-the-road are not enough.

If you take away the incentive (money for nothing) and pension (money for less than nothing), you change the dynamics and the burden on the public purse. For example, cutting the salary in half and eliminating the pension, means only the people with the best of intentions remain.

0,"the majority of KKK in Colorado back in the 20s was GOP. And that matches up with what our state was back in the 20s; GOP controlled. Are you Christian/Jewish/Muslim?

Many of them are NOT true believers. And based on what I see of today's churches and groups like the GOP, there are few true followers. Many so-called Christian have more in common with the devil, then with Christ. And finding a TRUE REPUBLICAN in the GOP at one of their meetings? Good Luck.

0,"Incorrect.  Please read Sacrosanctum Concilium and some of the related volumes about the reforms introduced by that Council document.  You are citing, I believe, the rationale for the pre-Vatican II liturgy (pick one) and not the conciliar return (recovery) of the early Church forms that were closely based on what Jesus of Nazareth actually did.  That seems to be the differences in the current arguments:  one advocates for the original form(s) of the early church, and the other desires the form(s) developed over the years by clerics that deliberately excluded the non-ordained from any involvement outside of a few responses to what the celebrant says or chants.  This article makes our arguments quite moot, as we now have a clearer magisterial statement from the pope about the need for continued reform.  We really should be discussing further liturgical development, and not rehashing old forms that no longer apply without substantial reasons.  Jesus never said to face East.

So whatever passes, if it passes, will be 100% owned by Congressional Republicans and a really incompetent Republican president (whom panicking R's are now insisting is not a """"real"""" Republican).

0,"I read Chapman's article on the flawed legal basis of Canadian citizenship and then the posts on that article. Many people have misunderstood the fundamental points of that article, which are as follows:  First, in Canada an individual receives citizenship not from the terms of the Charter but from whatever the current version of the Citizenship Act states are those requirements.  Second, like any piece of legislation, the Citizenship Act is subject to being easily changed to exclude people who previously were Canadian citizens.  Third, while the Charter protects your rights AS a citizen, the Charter DOES NOT ensure that you will REMAIN a Canadian citizen, and that can be lost through a legislative amendment. Fourth, this dangerous situation has created many people who are  now Lost Canadians and who need their rights restored through legislative amendments. Fifth, the long-term solution is to enshrine the grant of citizenship into the Charter. Until then, all Canadians are vulnerable.

It’s doubtful that the stronger real GDP growth will lead Poloz to raise the overnight rate anytime soon though. He seems to be a man on a mission to drive the loonie down as far as it can go. And he can always point to the ridiculously low inflation rate shown by the Bank’s new CPI-common measure (1.3% in both January and February), part of the operational guide since the start of 2017, as evidence that the economy is still weak, although all it really shows is that this measure is dysfunctional. The annualized three-month real GDP growth rate is 6.0% for January but the CPI-common inflation rate is lower than anything seen in the 2008-09 recession or its aftermath. It's simply ridiculous.

If you were to rank all the 19 year olds, you'd put McDavid at the top of the list, by a mile.  In fact, McDavid played as an 18 year-old and posted better than a pt/game.  Not too shabby.  Next, probably Laine, then Eichel, though I think he mighta just turned 20, then Matthews.  And Werenski in Clb, I mean, who's seen him play, eh?  21 pts, +7, 11 ppp.  Hard to compare def to for, but Werenski might be the next best after McDavid.  What about Tkaczuk in Cal?  Not getting quite the ice time the others are getting, but 18 pts, 62 PIM, he can play this game too.  And let's state what we know:  if Your Leafs had taken Laine over Matthews, who thinks Jonas Siegel would still be posting all these articles about the latter?

Indeed whiners and lily livers but not hunters.  These guys stalk around the Board of Game like big shots but they don't stalk track or hunt their food.

0,"The then 3rd place Liberals came to power with about 25 MPs with previous parliamentary experience and about 5 with cabinet experience.  So the new government was the least experienced Liberal government since the 1800s.   Trudeau was the only Liberal PM in over a century never to have sat in cabinet.  It was inevitable most cabinet ministers would be rookie MPs but the Liberals made the worst of a bad situation by selecting ministers on identity politics rather than on merit for cabinet positions.  Parliament should look much like the country it serves.  But cabinet should have the most qualified MPs available regardless of sex, race, religion and other identity factors extraneous to executive competence for such consequential executive jobs.  Only veteran minister Ralph Goodale consistently provides substantive answers to opposition questions.  Trudeau plus Chagger and most of the other rookies are a joke and an embarrassment.  Parliament is at its lowest point in many years.

0,"I can understand taking offense at the use of the terms like """"rare occurrence"""" and """"occasional mishaps."""" However, statistically, children killing or causing injury because they had unsupervised access to a firearm is rare. (I use the term children to refer to the very young; infants, babies, toddlers, innocents, etc, and not older children of say 16 years of age. The cutoff is arbitrary but I sense the emotional toll for older children is less than for the very young.)  Perhaps I failed to be clear in my letter. My point was that when children are killed or injured by another child who gained access to a firearm, the event is viewed with an elevated emotional element as opposed to the types of incidents you mention in your post. If gun owners don't pay attention to these incidents, and begin storing their firearms securely, they're going to lose ground to gun control advocates due to the increased emotions that accompany events involving the death and injury of children.

0,"Your buddy, Art: In 1993 State Senator George Jacko contacted Juneau police and troopers to get into a motel room where a young legislative aide was staying. He told them it was official state business and he needed to get into the room. He later admitted that he had been sexually involved with her. This incident sparked multiple complaints of sexual harassment from various women around the capital. In 1994, the Senate officially censured Jacko, ending his political career, or so we thought. News about Jacko continued to fill newspaper columns and evening news spots. In 1997, Jacko was served with a protective order to stay away from a 16-year-old girl in Homer. Within two hours he was arrested for violating that order. Per the Empire, the mother of the 16-year-old claimed that Jacko was “obsessed” with her daughter. The two would often engage in long phone conversations, including one that lasted 10 hours. In 1998 he was convicted of violating the restraining order.”

0,"Joseph, you raise an important point.  Is Big Oil losing money, or making money?  The secrecy rules the legislature has put into place do not allow the industry claims to be independently verified.  The industry will always claim they are losing money in order to take as much money as it can from Alaska.  What we do know is $7 billion dollars worth of oil is taken from Alaska each year (at current prices).  The oil pipeline was paid for decades ago.  Much of the in field facilities (gathering pipelines, dewatering facilities) was paid for by Alaskans through tax credits issued under ACES.  Under SB-21, if prices went to $60 to $70 per barrel, and the value of the oil taken from Alaska went from $7 billion to $9 to $11 billion per year, Alaska would STILL not collect any severance revenue.  See the problem?  There was a secret report a number of years ago that reported on the true costs the industry has moving North Slope oil to market.  The industry is NOT losing money.

So if you pay 20% of your income to the Feds as income tax, Seaton's proposal would tax you and additional 3% (.20*.15=.03).

About the same time Teddy R was pointing out the evils of corporate money, Montanans were dealing with the fact the Copper Kings wanted to buy most of the State Legislature and major State offices.  Stringent regulations were put in place which lasted a very long time.....until they were successfully challenged in court after the Citizens United decision.  Now we have Gianforte, he of the 'whack a reporter' mindset, as our lone Representative....oh, and his corporate flunky Steve Daines is one of our Senators.  Lucky us.

0,"....""""Few Catholics really believe that sex is for procreation only,""""...  There will come a time when 'the Church' will refer to Pope Paul 6 and 'Humanae Vitae' as the 'breakthrough document' acknowledging the fact that human sexuality is not always and only 'procreative'  Pul 6 acknowledges that, for humans, it is 'the natural law' that procreation is possible only during that period of the month when the woman is ovulating. And that sexual activity is permitted when procreation is not possible. And that 'family planning' is a Virtue.  He does contradict himself in trying to uphold former 'norms' prohibiting 'artificial' contraceptives; but once the rationale that 'all sexual activity must be procreative' is dispelled, the reasoning behind that norm is no longer valid.

What you don't admit/answer is why you feel that the state should be the one to """"provide resources to assist the families,"""" and not non-profits, churches, and private organizations-- organizations who have time and time again demonstrated that they are more efficient, organized, and equipped to deal with these challenges.  What's more- you don't actually articulate what these """"resources"""" are: care to give any actual statistics or specifics of services?  Like the government-run public school system, social work has now ballooned into trying to give countless services that it should not take it upon itself to give.  Government administrative burdens, bureaucracy, ever-growing restrictions, are money-sucking resource restrictions, and it is time for communities to give the resources to other organizations to help with this very important issue.

0,"If the deposit had kept up with inflation, it would be 25 cents. That the government has to levy a potential fine for people to return their bottles is an example of why some government interventions are justified. Throwing something """"away"""" (it never really goes away), represents an externality. The true cost of something is not in the original price. Unless there is a disposal cost, the consumer is making a purchase decision based on an artificially low price. That's an inefficient marketplace. When we do anything that externalizes the cost of something, we're bypassing pure capitalism. Pollution dumped into our air and water has costs. If you're not paying those costs upfront, someone else is. Pollution kills. Certainly we cannot stop all pollution. But we can regulate it. We can make business pay, which passes the cost to consumers. Is one a capitalist if one does not pay the true cost. Maybe it is a kind of theft.  We steal the savings from those who pay the cost in health issues.

These local laws may makes some incremental changes, but only a national referendum would change the purchasing environment.    You'd still have interantional gun runners (the US is a prime source of gun running now), who will try to subvert the law.

0,"The board of directors for AECON decided to put the company up for sale because they couldn't compete against the bigger construction companies. When China Communications Construction Co offered to buy the company, the board of directors happily accepted. Nobody is forcing AECON to be sold to the CCCI.  The Chinese government is undertaking a massive infrastructure project called One Belt One Road. Trillions of dollars are expected to be spent in construction over the next few decades. AECON is probably hoping to get fat contracts in the OBOR project.  It doesn't matter if the Americans are unhappy with AECON. The reality is that almost all big construction projects go to American firms especially with Trump in charge.

0,"Way back in 1972, the American owners in the NHL weren't much interested in the CANADA-RUSSIA SERIES. Some fought against it tooth and nail. Primarily because it also involved the newly-former National Hockey League Players Association - whom the owners deemed to be a """"threat"""" to the game. NHLPA president Alan Eagleson and NHL president Clarence Campbell despised each other - but did eventually co-operate.  In addition, the other main reason for trouble was that the American NHL owners didn't want """"their"""" Canadian players being injured during a series against the USA's Cold War enemy. There was also a growing """"America first"""" attitude in their hockey - with more and more good players coming out of U.S. colleges and universities. There were also some young Canadians in their schools - like '72 series' hero goaltender Ken Dryden. So, we are now having the NHL and its players association heading into a new battle - one that now includes players from many, many countries.

In many cases, it's because they themselves have breached systems used by the hacker group. Government-associated groups are identified and tracked, and their work can often be recognized by the tools and command & control servers they use, which for necessary efficiency are reused across different attacks. This is done not only by intelligence agencies but many private security companies, who sometimes release whitepapers on the subject.  The public evidence for Russian responsibility for the DNC and Podesta email hacks is very convincing. In the Podesta case a simple error in the attackers' use of the Bitly API allowed researchers to harvest their list of hacking targets, and it was thousands of western politicians & military officers, along with journalists & authors who cover Russian affairs.

I've used medication once again (cipralex) after many years for about a year, but otherwise I'm pretty good now at responding to depression before it can take over. Side effects from the effexor were there but quite reasonable, side effects from the cipralex were nil. The most recent depression medications have come a long way in terms of limiting side effects, though unfortunately people respond differently both in terms of side effects and in terms of the effectiveness of a particular drug as a treatment.  I think what helped make my treatment successful was a combination of a very good GP and a very good therapist. Unfortunately, doctors and therapists are not all created equal when it comes to treating chronic depression. I have heard too many anecdotes from acquaintances to believe that just any doctor or any (accredited) talk therapist will really help.

It would be like exempting a million people from the law against robbery or drug trafficking because applying the law to them would be mean, in the president's personal opinion. A president CANNOT do such a thing.

Yes, there is a large initial capital outlay - but my dad (an electrical engineer) calculated that - even at current electricity prices - you can borrow the money to do it, at prime rate interest, and replace the batteries when the time comes (in about 7 to 10 years with current technology) with MORE money borrowed, and with interest paybacks, you will still be paying LESS every month than your electricity bill would have been. And of course, by around 20 years - when you replace the  batteries teh second time (assuming that in 10 years time battery lifetimes haven't increased way beyond current levels - which is highly unlikely) you've paid off almost the entire loan, even if you reloan for a battery replacement this loan is much smaller now - so your monthly expenses go way down.

Certification by supervised vote, even a secret one,  requires the employer to be notified in advance and gives them time to threaten, intimidate and fire. When that happens, the damage is done; nothing removes the threat from the minds of employees.  All of the reported cases showing many, many cases of employer intimidation and very, very few cases of union intimidation show that.  Since you wanted to know.

0,"Ok, first of all, Star Trek came out before Star Wars. Two: Star Trek has vastly superior ships (shields, phasers, photon toroedeos) all much more powerful then the Star Wars destroyer. Not to mention the destroyer misses 29 out of 23 shots at close range when the ship is making no effort to maneuver from them. Star Trek ships also can reach higher speeds and go up to 9 times the speed of light.  Fights between the Republic and the Empire are complete junk as the Republic is always outgunned like 30 to 1 but still win. Star Trek also features a variety of episodes instead of always focusing on just poorly shooting each other. Not to mention the """"superior"""" AT walker which not tripped by thin wires and the Death Star which had a huge tunnel to the reactor.  I don't see how anything of Star Wars is better (besides the aliens) then Star Trek. It's simple: if Star Trek and Star Wars fought a battle Star Trek would win.

See my long comment here beginning """"Part 1"""" on the evidence. The evidence for early women priests is as of now, to the best of my knowledge, no where near as strong.  Yes, if women are ordained deacons, there will be a scramble to find new reasons why they can only be deacons and not priests or bishops. But the fundamental proposition that women can not receive Holy Orders will have been abandoned. And if sex if not an impediment to that sacrament, the logic that they can also be priests and deacons is irrefutable, although it will take time for that to be accepted.

So, they're celebrating about wins in places that they pretty much already held? That's kinda weird.  That being said, they have an excellent chance to snatch the House, guess it all depends on what the economy  doing around election time.

0,"I think that, as a consumer who values competition in the marketplace, we should stick with supporting the system of shipping methods that all retailers in the economy may use. Vertical and horizontal corporate trusts should be broken up by the FTC on principle for the sake of US consumer protection and liberty from corporate predilection and predation. Beyond that, in this age of National Security Letters and high-profile hacking exfiltrations of consumer privacy from corporate enterprises great and small alike, trust is in very short supply.  To whom you grant access to your locked home or control over that lock electronically should be scrutinized with all due diligence with high standards and in a pure fashion, because this sort of security seems to me an absolute all-or-nothing affair. I'm pretty sure that Amazon is functionally opaque to sufficient such diligence. The last thing you need is to discover a system like this being used against your own best enlightened interests.

0,"I agree, all male-designed religions (which is more or less all of them) push the idea that God or the gods made women to serve, obey, nurture and satisfy men. Even religions that have godesses usually place them lower in the divine order than mortal men, usually on a par with male warhorses.  But Catholicism distinguishes itself in its conviction that God is horrified and disgusted by women and its view that the best and holiest life and the one most pleasing to God is a life lived in the complete absence of women.  St. Robert Bellarmine said, in his case for the canonization of St. Aloysius Gonzaga, that the latter was so perfectly holy that he took a vow when he was twelve never to speak to a woman and never to be in the presence of one if he could help it and to keep his eyes fixed on the ground when he couldn't help it, in order to avoid looking at her.  Not a saint likely to appeal to normal healthy men.

0,"But unlike Pakistan, Canada is an advanced, progressive society where men and women are treated as equals and we don't subjugate women under the guise of piety or modesty. This is not about cultural relativism or """"diversity"""", it is a function of progress. Canada isn't Tehran or Peshawar or Riyadh, not because we are different, because we are an advanced secular society. The niqab is part of a belief system that kills homosexuals and censors any critical analysis of religion under penalty of death. The fact that Canada doesn't have apostasy or blasphemy laws is not about cultural relativism, it is about universal interpretations of right and wrong. Europe's experience shows us that laissez-faire, """"hope for the best"""" accommodation of assertive political Islam has failed conclusively. Quebec's law is certainly warranted given Europe's experience with cultural segregation.

If the Brexit and domestic nationalities issues had been seriously addressed from such a perspective within the UK over the past decade or 2 (rather than events being propelled in fits and starts without preparation through emotion-laden referendums), then much better outcomes might well have been achieved. For example, the UK might be remaining within the EU (but leading a successful effort, supported by many of the 28 member States, to formally allow two forms of membership - full quasi-federal members or common market members.  Likewise, the UK itself might well be moving away from being a quasi-unitary State to becoming a federal union of English regional states and Scotland, Northern Ireland ad Wales.  Other reasonable outcomes might have emerged but the UK wouldn't now be advancing zombielike into God knows what geopolitically and domestically.

The rejected viewpoint that comes to mind was a civil and measured response to a CB column and just happened to be what some might characterize as a radical deviation from the philosophy of the mainstream status quo. It could (should) have fostered interesting, insightful and reasoned civil debate yet the editors deemed it as not meeting civility standards (code for CB's hypocrisy) and the editors squashed and suppressed the contrary viewpoint prior to public airing.  I'm in total agreement that allowing select readers - especially readers with opposing viewpoints- to render a submission containing polite contrary views to their own as not meeting civil standards is a devious cherry-picking subterfuge for CB's editorial biases.  CB please clarify your censorship protocols as it regards comments.

When the boundaries of the district were redrawn to become """"Kensington"""" in 2010, it then encompassed the best known areas of Kensington further south, but not Chelsea.

People that hold mutual funds are primarily retail investors with limited knowledge of capital markets, i.e. they are more easily spooked and will sell on fear as opposed to a rational assessment of relevant factors including their own financial situation. That forces managers to fund redemptions by selling into a falling market causing it to fall even faster, it's a vicious circle. Managers may have to make snap decisions that are governed by liquidity over value and thus not in the best interests of other unitholders, especially if there are tax consequences involved. Speaking of taxes, a mutual fund is required to pass tax consequences on to its unitholders who may or may not have participated in the gains that triggered the taxes depending on when they bought the fund. Tax liabilities are just one more reason to avoid mutual funds in the first place.  /rant :)

0,"If your thesis is true, then God had no reason to Incarnate because Judaism had the 'truth' and no change was needed.  People could accept or reject that truth, or be lucky enough to be born into a Jewish family.  Jesus came in spite of all that institutional assurance.  Jesus always comes and He always has to compete with entrenched institutional religious truth.  I suppose that might actually always be the only real truth.

But then, logical thinking is not something Catholic traditionalists do all that well.  In all my comments on NCR over the years, I have taken exactly one thing from Andrew Greeley. I quoted him saying that a more accurate name for the University of Notre Dame football team would be """"The Fighting Black Baptists"""" rather than """"The Fighting Irish"""".  Believe it or else, I had a sociology course in college, and it was from that I got the terms Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft.

We can't have a well-rounded education as long as our schools are beholden to high-stakes tests. It's the stakes that are really to blame.

0,"With $60 Billion in the Permanent Fund and the Constitutional Budget Reserve Alaska can do what is right, pay the bills and go home and come back and start fresh next year in 2018.  Next year the legislature can fix the broken oil and gas system so Alaskans can fill the Trans Alaska Pipeline and bring back the Cook Inlet's oil & gas greatness.  Texas increased its oil production by one million barrels of oil per day since Attorney Bill Walker became Governor because they elect their oil & gas commissioner and have a better system that prevents monopolies and provides reasonable permitting and bonding laws that allows competition.  Alaska is having trouble because the current system keeps oil & gas investors out of Alaska!  If the next Legislature does away with all tax credits and all taxes it will increase the state's royalty because investors will produce more oil and gas with a system that is not controlled by a few giant oil companies and a few bad paid off abusive people in power

I can't imagine even thinking job well done with the deployment of multiple armored vehicles and what 10-20 police officers armed with .223 or .308 semi or full automatic high power rifles equipped with scopes.  Such militaristic deployment is beyond the scope of law enforcement.  The only reason the dude is not dead is because he kept hidden and the only reason collateral damage did not occur is because the officers did not open up.

Yes, the game is very fast and some unfortunate injuries occur, as a result. At the same time, to return to the coaching: is it possible that years of coaches telling players to go to the net, go to the net, go to the net, has become the kind of play where players (fast and big) simply end up crashing the net because the pressure to score is so significant? """"Going to the net"""" becomes, perhaps, an irresponsible """"hockey play,"""" that does not respect the opponent.

0,"As a practicing physician I find several things about this situation  to be questionable. The regulations about tramadol changed almost 2 years ago. To be prescribing it and not to be aware of this is an error of exceptional proportions. It suggests that the prescriber is not adequately familiar with the medication. Tramadol is not a risk free medication. It has been known to cause seizures and induce delirium. Using it to treat opiate withdrawal is not medically supportable with the current information base. It is not approved for this purpose and there are no studies of adequate quality to justify its use in this way. Additionally, having a provider with no DEA certification prescribing medications for the relief of  substance withdrawal is not acceptable practice. The medications used to treat alcohol withdrawal, in particular,  have ALWAYS required it. More investigation needs to be done regarding the safety, validity and effectiveness  of the treatment that these clinics provide.

0,"University of Washington neurologist Ethan Russo postulates that “clinical endocannabinoid deficiency” underlies migraines, fibromyalgia, IBD, and a cluster of other degenerative conditions which may respond favourably to cannabinoid therapies... CB receptor signaling modulates pain and analgesia, inflammation, appetite, gastrointestinal motility, neuroprotection and neurogeneration, along with the ebb and flow of immune cells, hormones, and other mood-altering neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate (213). Cannabinoids (endo [naturally occurring], herbal, and synthetic) are anti-inflammatory; they literally cool the body. But... if the immune system overreacts to chronic stress or mistakes one’s body for a foreign object, then the stage is set for another autoimmune disease or an inflammatory disorder to develop.

The payment came from “a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting” the stock of a company called Uranium One, which reportedly was taken over by the Russians between 2009 and 2013 – and had donor links to the Clinton Foundation.  According to the Times’ own reporting, among other donations, the company’s chairman used his family foundation to direct $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation. Under Hillary Clinton, the State Department also was among the agencies to sign off on the Russian takeover of what had been a Canadian company.

Right? There’s nobody right now that President Trump would probably say, “Oh, you’re accused of a crime. You said you didn’t do it, I believe you.” So the idea that he would do that with an adversary shows two things: that he truly doesn’t understand what it means to keep America safe and national security and the second part, that he actually can’t handle one-to-one confrontations and conversations.

The street battles among them ---and the anarchy that it induced---seems to have been one factor helping the rise of the Nazis . What stopped the rise of the Nazis for a while was the coercive power of the liberal state curtailing paramilitary organizations and their demonstrations, but the effect of that was undercut by Hindenburg and von Papen, their dislike of the liberal state,  and their foolish belief that they could  control Hitler.

As for Europe, it does not need more people, and certainly not Muslims and Africans.  We need to be focused on quality of life and balance with nature.

0,"The wishes of the majority of US voters was ignored. The EC system in the US literally makes those up to 49.999% of actual votes just disappear in all but 2 States.  The result was that in 3 small swing States, about 70,000 votes 'trumped' those of nearly 3 million MORE votes in the other 47 States. Actually, the 3 million more votes that were cast for Clinton than for Trump don't even take into account the other votes for candidates. If you add them in, a total of 11,119,360 MORE votes were cast for someone else than FOR him. That would be the true """"wishes of the majority"""", - of ALL voters - but the EC system doesn't work that way.  If all States' EC voters' votes were apportioned on a percentage basis instead of 'winner take all', then the """"wishes of the (actual) majority"""" - of the entire populace - would be ACCURATELY reflected in the outcome. Not to re-hash the results of the election, just decrying that the EC system does not reflect the actual will of the majority of US voters.

Her banshee-like rants have nearly all of her counterparts shaking their heads in bewilderment. She couldn't even handle the governorship of South Carolina, much less, her current post. She should've kept her job as a Waffle House waitress, as she excelled in it. It would be more difficult replacing Trump .. His VP, Mike Pence, isn't any better .. He may very well be worse, since he isn't as independent as Trump. He's a Globalist, Trump isn't.

Frankly even if we did need some baseload generation (which is actually a falsehood as well) we could do that with a few natural gas generators since they can be switched on and off on demand and only ever used if both wind and solar were to fail for longer than our storage can last (a highly rare scenario anyway).

0,"John Stokes, you are probably *the last person* who should be taking others to task re: transparency.  Let's help educate the public re: PAC support, shall we? I consider myself a fairly informed voter and I didn't understand this about PACs until yesterday: they can do what they want independent of the candidates they support. In other words, a PAC decides it wants to support Candidate A so it sends out mailers, runs ads, and makes robocalls in that candidate's name. Candidate A has nothing to do with any of those things, has no control over them, and doesn't know about them until after the fact when they hear about them. Yet, an uninformed public believes those communications are coming directly from the candidate's camp. So... a Republican PAC made a robocall (and didn't pronounce Fricke's name right) for the men but that *doesn't* mean they are Republicans. Nobody's hiding anything except you hiding the truth about what PACs can do.  """"Neighborhood Party""""... you'll never be a member

The rich do and they will donate regardless of what incentives are offered.  The middle class on the other hand do not but would be far more likely to donate $20 per month knowing they get a rebate in April for some of their donations.

Toronto is simply being used as the economic engine for Ontario, with insufficient tax dollars collected from Toronto by the Province returned to the City by the Province.  Since Mike Harris' government, the amount of tax returned to Toronto by the Province has been well below historic levels and inadequate for Toronto to maintains its infrastructure and services.  In the meantime, 905ers like to ride on roads and mass transit paid for by Toronto taxpayers while refusing to contribute to the very services they use every day.  The Provincial Constitution needs to be amended to return to pre-Mike Harris days the percentage of tax returned to Toronto from that remitted to the Province by Toronto.

I believe we can assume Hanchett was an emotional basket case that needed help, long before the crime.  It is understandable that she was in an abusive relationship at 18 years old.  Again, I must reiterate that our 'system' of mental health services is grossly deficient and under funded.

That's about the same percentage of psychopaths that are found in the overall prison population, and perhaps 10 times higher than what you find in the general population.  So is it possible that Trump has some form of anti-social personality disorder? As a former CEO, there looks to be about a one-in-five chance that he does.

Suddenly, the bill was losing votes from both the far-right and the purple-state Republicans. In a matter of days, the congressional coalition behind Trump’s top legislative priority simply collapsed. TrumpCare was toast. TrumpCare was terrible, but terrible legislation passes all the time. The difference this time was that you were organized and determined. You mounted a sustained, nationwide resistance that broke the will of the Republican caucus and derailed Trump’s agenda.

A kill list sounds terrible, but the alternative is slaughter the entire community or nation, until they say 'uncle'.  Our military is trying to sell us 'clean' wars where only bad guys die.

Since people openly like the self-gratification of sex so much, but are reticent to admit that it's just for fun or worse, and/or are resentful of those who would dare suggest they limit their sexual acts, religion and psychology have found a way to connect lustful sex to love and all of the other worthier aspects mentioned by the other commenter.  Thus, instead of having sex, we """"make love.""""  And we Catholics create some sort of """"unifying bond.""""

This dualistic distinction is unfortunate but necessary based on that which is observable and that which is knowable outside of observation.  Within the Christian (broadly) and Catholic (specifically) traditions, the two are harmonized most closely in that science is tethered to an underlying belief in the Goodness of a Creator and that we can know something of His mind through His actions in the physical realm.  This leads us to the Divine Watchmaker of the Deists but, without revelation, I think, no further.  In that Catholic sense, then, there already exists a """"symbiosis"""".  The Catholic faith informs scientific inquiry and infuses it with greater meaning than the merely mechanical one given by science alone.

There is probably as much smoke in Trump's claim as there is in the media/DNC inspired  Russian matter.  Take the state of California. They have the most liberal voter registration in the nation. Since 2015 you are automatically registered to vote when you get or renew your drivers license.  Now, that doesn't sound too bad on the surface, until you 'investigate' a little further.  Since 2013 people immigrating illegally have been  able to legally obtain a drivers license.  In all fairness to the state of CA they do claim that they encourage people to 'opt out' if  they are not here legally, or are not actually a citizen.

1,"I'm remembering a time when the Anti-Imperialist Alignment group effectively took over the student union funded campus newspaper at the University of Waterloo in the mid-1970's. Despite having not the slightest visible trace of support from the student body, the AIA published such ludicrous rubbish and hectored every visiting establishment speaker with such vehemence that soon the blatantly racist and sophomoric Engineering Department publication became the go-to outlet for campus news and events. That development reminds me that taxes and union dues have no sustainable place in journalism; even if the so called journalists get the funding, they end up slitting their own throats.

0,"I vote for no income tax. An income tax means the state decides how much of the fruits of my labor I am allowed to keep. Cut the budget closer to its fundamental purpose of protecting people from other people. Then I would support a flat sales tax. All citizens would then be involved in paying the bills of state, not just the people who work. The politicians would not be so quick to spend other peoples’ money when all citizens had to pay the bills. Our Founding Fathers did not support a direct tax on individuals because it was detrimental to liberty. They favoured tariffs, which is a consumption tax. A sales tax is a consumption tax. Marx & Engels did not care about individual liberty. They made the income tax the 2nd plank of their “The Communist Manifesto”. https://nccs.net/2001-04-a-proper-system-of-taxation

They want to get rid of Trump and get Pence in there who will continue their war of terror on Syria, maybe get the ball rolling in Iran.  Guess who else loves Pence.  The Koch brothers.  The media and the FBI need to put up or shut up.  There is a reason they catapult the propaganda before any facts are out.  They want to create the 'truth' themselves for Americans who blindly believe them.  But who could possibly believe the media about anything after they promoted war in Iraq?  The forged evidence used in that attack on millions innocent people, was discovered by the UN to be a laughable forgery with a 5 minute google search.  The media did no research whatsoever,just catapulted the propaganda.

0,"Let me guess MMackinnon, math isn’t your strong suit. Here’s a simple example for you, Alberta has a smaller population than Ontario so it pays less in total taxes (but more per person). Let’s keep the numbers simple, Alberta pays the feds $150 in taxes and receives $100 back in transfers as we are a net contributor. Ontario pays $500 in taxes given the larger population, however, it receives $550 back in transfers as a have not province and a net benefactor of equalization. So who paid more in taxes? We pay taxes to the fed and the fed sends transfers back to the provinces. If you receive more in transfers than you’ve paid in (as is the case with all have not provinces), by definition, you’ve paid less tax on a net basis than a have province. Equalization forces you to look at everything on a net basis. Net of transfer payments, Ontario does not pay the largest portion of federal taxes. It’s illogical to look at taxes in isolation from transfer payments given equalization.
"
0,"They moved because they were easily able to do so. The economic decline in Quebec, and particularly in Montreal, which, heavily aided by the sovereignty movement, gained full steam in the 1970s, prompted many Anglo Quebecers to pursue employment opportunities outside the province. For Francophone Quebecers, and especially those not fluent in English, this option wasn't as attractive. Nor was the sense of urgency as acute for them. Two of my my best friends are displaced Anglo Quebecers (one bilingual and the other not) who moved to Ontario in their 20s to (successfully) pursue their careers. The trend is echoed in the westward movement of people from the Atlantic provinces during the same period, albeit without the added push of ethnic nationalism.

0,"Legitimate refugees who's lives are in danger or economic migrants abusing our system and naïve government? There's a big difference between the two and this government sides with incorrectly categorizing them as refugees when they're actually economic migrants like we saw with the Syrians and Haitians pouring in from the US now. The Syrians were safe in their refugee camps back in the Middle East. They are part of a large Middle East problem that is best resolved by that region and Muslims nations that just can't get along with anyone. Still, it would have been more cost effective for us to dedicate all efforts directly to the Middle East camps. Once refugees leave their safe and protected areas they then become economic migrants. The elephant in the room is the fact Arab nations expect the rest of the world to be the dumping ground for the problems they create themselves but rarely do we see any of the rich petro states stepping up to the plate to offer assistance and solutions.

In many routine tasks computers are simply better, faster and more accurate and to boot,don't need breaks other than scheduled downtime. See HF trading or radiology or case/literature review for the disruption automation and ai computers will have. There will still be work for professionals, just we will need fewer and the traditional entry level stuff will be gone!  Canada is woefully unprepared for this. Far too many university grads and not enough skilled technicians. Especially to service the burgeoning automated systems.

Most items in commercial use are flame and fire resistant.

A match burns @ 600 degrees plus and a cigarette @ 500 degrees plus.  A cake bakes @350 degrees or so and it is not uncommon to preheat ones oven to 400 degrees.  Traces of flammable liquids are discernable by residue, odor, burn patterns and other means.  Multiple points of origin are also indicators.

If you look at the ideological leanings of the current governments each of them sit to the right of our current government albeit to the left of the Harper government.  Up until 2000, generally social democratic parties won, but since then its mostly been liberal or conservatives winning.  They are also more conservative in some ways as four of the five charge user fees for doctor's visits, 4 of the 5 have parallel private systems for health care, all of them have a lower corporate tax rate than Canada.  Also their taxes are lot flatter as the top marginal rate are only slightly higher, but middle incomes pay a lot more in taxes never mind they have a 25% VAT so our tax structure is actually more progressive.

Walk through the mall and notice more vacancies than ever. In fact, Ala Moana never used to have empty stores. Now there are lots of them. Putting Target, Ross and Saks's off 5th at what used to be one of the highest grossing malls in America says it all. Those stores are definitely not paying the same kinds of rent as the luxury retailers in there. Those tenants (luxury retailers) have to be pretty upset by these changes. For those wishing AMC catered more to locals...they appear to be getting their wish as the inevitable shift of AMC going down market is starting to occur...

As a retired teacher, some of my worst Principals were women, petty women or Pollyannas who were afraid of intelligent, confident women, and still batting their eyelashes at men. And yet one of my best Principals was a woman, an ex military woman, who truly believed in equality of male and female students of all races and listened to all staff equally, taking into consideration opinions and suggestions. It is truly amazing to me that those books have not been read by young women who think they have it all. [They don't, but they need to find that out.

Everett Koop, former US Surgeon General, said nicotine is more addictive than heroin.

So when the burglar comes calling (and at all other times), simply use the firearm you already have with you. Also, and more importantly, follow the 4 basic rules of firearms safety and know the laws governing the use of lethal force so you don't injure or kill someone when the use of lethal force is not warranted..

Six universities now offer degrees in sales, typically within the college of business.  Most notable is my alma mater, the University of Toledo, which graduates 120 or so folks each year who have majored in sales.  These young people are highly sought after, and typically have multiple job offers.  In the business realm, The Sales Resource Center (www.thesalesresourcecenter.com)  offers 450 individual  lessons for sales people and sales leaders.

I suspect if Trump asked for a referendum with americans whether they should reduce their payments to the UN by and only pay for <5% of the total budget instead of 22, he will get a resounding yes.   5% is roughly comparable to the proportion of US population as a fraction of the total world population.

But I have to take much greater issue with your second point, the government investing in research with no immediate marketability.  Your claim is that government funding of science should be limited to applied research with clear economic payoffs. However, if the financial payoff has a clear high likelihood, that is where private industry should take over, as the free market will bring about huge efficiency gains. Indeed, this is the bulk of private research funds in Canada and around the world (both via universities and in-house). The ONLY place where the government has any mandate to spend money is where the profit motive ISN'T clear, be it financing basic research or anything else for that matter, because everything else can be handled more efficiently by the private sector.

Citizens have overturned fluoridation in other communities based on the groundless fear-mongering of anti-fluoridationists on the Internet.  Fluoridation is only adding a few more fluoride ions to the identical fluoride ions found in ground water.  This helps remineralize teeth round the clock, making them more resistant to decay.  Toothpaste only provides a 2-hour spike of protection.  That's why fluoridated water -- used in food and drinks -- can prevent an additional 25% reduction in cavities.  This adds up, over a lifetime, to keeping teeth into old age and saving a bundle in dental bills.  And it's so easy and benefits everyone.  As a nurse, I have seen in unfluoridated areas how dentures and poor dental health in the elderly can seriously reduce their quality of life.

For example, numerous sites could tell you the US is in the middle of industrialized country tax rates, with many countries over 10% higher average tax burden and top rates much higher. Crime rates have been dramatically dropping nationwide since the 1990's, with a recent upswing in large cities only. Some think lax gun policy is partly to blame. Local law enforcement is controlled by State and local funding, and antitax policies have squeezed their budgets, not federal policy. No one has proposed eliminating the second amendment. The middle class has been losing ground since the early 1990's, but average losses over the last 20 years or so are closer to 20%, not 40%, and reasons are complex and go far beyond Obama.

He’ll simply reply that “many people say I’m right,” effectively denying the validity of what is usually known as “facts.” The president is responding to a claim of fact not by denying the fact, but by denying the claim that facts are supposed to have on an argument. “He isn’t telling (his opponent) that he’s got his facts wrong. He’s saying that as far as he is concerned facts, as most people understand the term, don’t matter.

0,"This has been a powerful and disturbing series and leaves me with a large question: Is there an analogy or is there not between physical illness and immoral behavior?  If there is, then, just as having a good attitude and habits can help a person recover from or survive a physical illness, but—as we know—good attitude and habits sometimes are not powerful enough, then also conscience, prayer, and will can help a person resist temptation, but they are sometimes not powerful enough either. There might be issues of brain chemistry, genetics, or the venom of past destructive experiences, which modulate subsequent development and really do prevail. Moral lapses, like physical illness, then become a more hazy realm, making judgement complex, even difficult.  If we say that there is not that analogy, then we are saying that immorality is not like an illness; the responsibility for lapses is wholly within the individual, whose conscience and will are deficient.  This is my large question.

A persons wages are his/her personal property. No government has a right to take that property unless there is a just compensation for the seizure of said property. Here in lays the irony it. Only those who work will pay to the public coffers for public services and those who do not work will not pay but still receive the same services as those that pay.

It is possible Bernhardt was so angry he could not think straight and when uniformed police officers approached him he also perceived them as a threat and raised his crossbow at them in which they responded with lethal force.  I don't know why you brought race into the discussion as I don't think race had anything to do with the situation.  Once a person, no matter what race or what their mental state or condition, for WHATEVER reason confronts police with a lethal weapon such as a crossbow or spear, options that a police officer can take are extremely limited and they have every right to protect themselves and others to stop the threat.

NORAD is a no fail mission and something that we do do. Harper gets a lot of flack but he did rebuild the Army's six Mechanized Infantry battle groups as well as the countries Strategic and tactical lift. Importantly for our civilian economy Harper spent close to 4 Billion on base construction projects all across Canada. The rebuild of the Halifax class is another quiet success storey of the last ten years. The Dewolfe class is under construction with HMCS Dewolfe probably leaving the barn in April or May this year. Icebreakers done.  We should buy 24 F-15E'S and base them in RAF Lakenheath with the Yanks Then buy the mature F-35's in ten years. Buy three Virginia class Subs as well as 4 Burke Class destroyers. The Yanks maintain the subs and load the Burkes with SM-6's for ballistic missile defence.

0,"These efforts by well-meaning pundits, trying to be fair, in effect to coddle the Trump voters, and to blame us urban educated types for either ignoring those voters or mocking them, end up being not fair at all.  For one thing, many of those voters in rural areas and left-behind small towns and cities happen not to be all that underprivileged, to judge from the crowds who turned out for the campaign rallies. The matter of slighted dignity was surely a factor in the outcome of this election, as in many political developments everywhere. But voting for Trump, by way of """"getting back"""" at the """"elite,"""" was hardly a praiseworthy moral reaction.  That said, it is true that already a long time ago Democrats and liberals got themselves into trouble when they let themselves be called """"elite,"""" a term that used to belong to GOP plutocrats. And we were wrong to fail to address the ill effects of the shifting economy.

0,"That's an interesting comparison, and it illustrates why you have to consider every conflict differently.  The last two battles for Fallujah caused huge destruction in the city. The first was delivered by the US/UK military, and the second was delivered by the Iraqi military backed up by the USA.  However, in both battles the number of civilian losses were relatively light- possibly in the hundreds, rather than thousands. The reason? In both cases the insurgents occupying the city allowed the civilians to evacuate prior to the battle. Contrast that with Aleppo, where the insurgents/terrorists refused to evacuate the civilians from the areas they controlled. The consequence, of course, was greater civilians losses in Aleppo. But even so, the losses are nothing like what Saunders is alleging.

While this profiteer constantly attempts to exploit fluoridation for personal gain, he callously sells his water in plastic containers made with the known neurotoxin, BPA.  Kind of puts the extent of the self-servitude of these antifluoridationists, and the nonsense they plaster all over the internet,  into proper perspective.  1.  The only dental fluorosis which may be associated with optimally fluoridated water is mild to very mild, a barely detectable effect which causes no adversity on cosmetics, form, function, or health of teeth.  As peer-reviewed science has demonstrated mildly fluorosed teeth to be more decay resistant, many consider this effect to not even be undesirable, much less adverse.  2.

Arriving in Canada without legal status and claiming refugee status is one of the legal options under the IRPA which incorporates into domestic law one of our longstanding international obligations to refugees going back to 1951.  It is a major reason for the existence of the Refugee Protection Division and its predecessor tribunals.  BTW s.133 of the current IRPA provides an exemption for refugees for prosecution for illegal entry to Canada.  This exemption dates back to the UN 1951 Convention on Refugees contained in Article 31.

0,"Re """"amma"""" and """"abba"""": If Jesus had called God """"amma,"""" he wouldn't have been stoned, he would have been ignored. He would have had zero followers.  But """"abba"""" is scarcely a traditional way to speak of God in Israel's tradition. Jesus indicated an essential intimacy in his relationship with God, and it is the intimacy, not the masculine-gender form that Jesus' image took, that matters. As such, following that indication, we need not feel further restricted to Dad-talk and Father-talk as we develop our understanding of God and our relationship with God.

0,"United made a YUGE mistake here by contacting the rabbit's seller instead of the buyers.  If the financial transaction had occurred by the time of shipment (as it surely must have), the seller became the buyer's limited agent whose authority over only the transport terminates when the plane leaves the ground.  The new owners are the only ones with the right to authorize cremation, etc.  United shows every sign of an obvious consciousness of guilt.  They knew, or certainly should have known, who had the legal authority with regard to this rabbit.  They clearly knew that cremation prior to necropsy would destroy any and all evidence as to the cause of death. United didn't play fair, and any judge or jury will surely find for the plaintiffs.  This IS indeed about more than one rabbit.  I feel sorry for the poor bun.  Continental Giants and their cousins Flemish Giants are awesome critters.

0,"Berman writes that a “measure of inflation that excludes volatile food and energy items declined to 1.5 per cent in April, which is below the Fed’s 2-per-cent target, and the latest ISM non-manufacturing survey suggests it could fall further.” That would be the PCEPILFE, the personal consumption expenditure price index excluding food and energy, which went from an annual inflation rate of 1.6% in March to 1.5% in April. However, while this is the preferred core inflation measure of the US Fed, its inflation target indicator is actually the PCEPI itself, which had a 1.7% inflation rate in April, down from 1.85% in March. Also, the US Fed also looks at another core inflation measure, the trimmed mean, whose 12-month rate of change was 1.75% in April, down from 1.8% in March.

But when a (being? Beelzebub?) stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils."""" (King James version)  Luke chapter 11 starts with teaching the Lord's prayer which we still speak today, and also the beautiful instruction """"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto thee.""""  In other words, be generous to your friends, don't let evil into your life or it will overcome you and destroy you.  This parable isn't about guns, which didn't exist 2000 years ago, it is about avoiding evil in our dealings with others, lest evil overcome us.

Everybody is well aware of the Chinese communist government's predatory, dishonest, unethical and one sided track record when it comes to trade.  Currently, we already buy over $3 worth of Chinese imports for every dollar of our exports they buy from us and we have a giant trade deficit with them.  Aside from the important issue of whether we want to trade ever more closely and expansively with a communist regime that does not observe the standards we and others do in regard to human rights and health, safety and other employment standards, there is also the question of just how one sided we want our trade with China to be.  (e.g. The US trade deficit with China in 2015 was about $360 billion.)  Scheer is right to urge care, caution and concern!

Also, they held a consultation online and have not released the results - so what were the results.  I will point out that 300k persons per year has not helped our economy. It does not help our economy to have high immigration with no job creation - that is the path environmental disaster and economic disaster for the people (not the 1%).  Has your MP asked what your opinion is so they can take it to Ottawa which is how our democracy is supposed to work? Did the Liberals identify in their platform that they planned to increase immigration? How about real consultation such as a referendum/plebiscite?  Canadians need to organize for pro-slow immigration.

The federal government was tiny, not the massive, all-intrusive monster we have today,  and had almost no impact on the common person. People thought of themselves commonly as a Virginian or a Pennsylvanian. The Constitution gave all authority except in certain specifics to the States. When their state seceded, something not prohibited in the Constitution,  many had to make a painful choice, the federal government (of which legally they were not a citizen of after secession) or their State. Many of the officers described this dilemma in their writings at the time.  Those that chose the CSA fought as honorably and well as those who fought for the USA. They were made US Veterans by law after the Civil War, so people tearing down the statues are desecrating memorials to US Veterans.

A change in consumer demand will lower products produced in Mexico. America expects to make up to $10 bn yearly based on current sales. Lower future sales due to high import taxes could likely result in America making less on imported products than they do now.

0,"Hard to accept the release of the latest documents surrounding  Bill Clinton had to be released yestersay.  It is been years and years since this investigation was conducted.  The FBI made no indication of what is the time line guidance they use to release past investigations. Nor did they disclose what criteria they use to decide which investigation files are to be released in all cases.  Something about this seems rather politically motivated when the FBI can selectively make such releases of past investigations.

Rifles - 374 Shotguns - 262 Knives or Cutting - 1604 Hands/Feet - 656 Other weapons (bats, etc..) - 1806 Unk Firearms - 3263 Handguns - 7105  So why are people so up in arms about the big bad black assault rifles when they are really one of the least used in murders? Maybe it would be better to research a bit and state facts and then try to work on the real issues like gangs, repeat offenders, mental health. It's shame our media and legislators do not do a better job of researching before they look foolish.

If a person is unemployed (or underemployed, whatever the case) he or she does not contribute to GDP. Multiply this loss by the millions of people in such predicament and you'll see lower GDP, lower tax revenues collected, etc. Unemployment due to the artificial barrier of background checks results in an annual $65 billion hit to GDP.

0,"There were lots of reasons that the economy of the 60's was robust, strong unions, and a lack of competition for manufacturing jobs from less expensive overseas plants are certainly components. But, we also poured money into infrastructure programs (lots of construction jobs), had a tax structure that didn't encourage the concentration of wealth (higher paying jobs), and invested in education and research (allowing for more economic mobility and setting the stage for innovation and the modern economy). In my experience people who grew up then completely forget how much benefit they received, and like to pretend that they were just harder working, or that people today are just lazy. That is nonsense, it was in the late 70's when worker productivity and salary stopped paralleling each other. American workers today are incredibly productive, but salaries haven't kept up. That missing money was given to the wealthy elite because of republican tax and government policies.

Listening to educated women and mothers would be better while listening to all women across the board from rich elite, educated to uneducated, working poor, stay-at-home women to the poor and starving.  Not one women listened to talked about how the church can make the lives of everyday women better.

Prosecutors have an arsenal of tools, which they can and do use, at a much higher occurrence than defense attorneys have to toll the Speedy SOL. The most common are simply not even points that can be challenged by the defense, meaning the late disclosures of new discovery, and the proffered amount of time that it takes to investigate and examine the same. Ironically, every judicial district in the state now has a direct discovery chain/link to the corresponding Public Defender's office, yet, instead of quelling the problem, it's only allowed prosecutors to further muddy-up the water. Between the 'new/additional witness disclosures,' the never-failing request for Mental Health Eval - days before trial (never before) etc.. have turned this in to a game for the DA's. Ironically, these issues seem only to stem when an already incarcerated inmate is set for trial - and not with those out on bond.

See if Cottage Grove, Creswell, Oakridge, Junction City and Florence also want in on the deal. The contract could be on a per call or per service basis, billed to the particular government entity responsible for the location of the problem, with bill backs to the citizen responsible for the animal involved, wherever possible. This is solvable with some co-operation.  Just to be clear, voting for Measure 97 will not help fix this issue. The revenue from that goes only to the State, not the counties. NO on 97.

So serious US preparation for an attack-- like moving 10,000 plus civilians and military dependent families out of N.

One thing's for sure, corporate leaders will do what's best for their corporations, it's up to governments to put reasonable constraints on what they can do.

The notion, however, that communist China can replace the US in terms of economic interests is an alternative that may alter our relationship in a most regretable manner.

Given that the ownership of the complex is being contested, wonder if all those business's there are paying rent and if yes, to whom.

Libs and Cons have been trying to raise immigration rates in order to shore up the tax base to pay for medicare and other services for a growing bulge (baby boomers) that are leaving the work force and are going to be on fixed incomes and not really contributing to the tax base anymore. There is a demographic imbalance that has to be fixed. Many well educated immigrants (not refugees) start businesses and employ Canadians which in in turn grow the tax base. Immigration is definitely part of the solution notwithstanding the challenges mentioned in the article about declining union membership and greater percentage of part-time work which I attribute to large economic uncertainties in a rapidly evolving economy with huge technological changes that have been introduced by the internet and artificial intelligence etc.  It will be years before that settles out.

0,"If Obamacare explodes, insurance companies will go bankrupt and that bankruptcy may yet give us a sinlge payer plan, although Congress would have to eact the payroll or value added tax to fund it. Health care is a positive right, like food stamps or retirement income. Sadly, positive rights tend to be underfunded (a word to the wise for guaranteed income advocates).  The right to life is both a positive and negative right. The negative right is soley the right to not forcing eugenic abortions on poor women and prisoners or parents on teenage daughters. Birth control cannot be forced either, although some judges have gotten away with it until someone notices. The positive right to life can go two ways. One is through government prohibition on abortion, which steps on a woman’s right not to procreate. The second part of a right to life is government support of childbirth and childhood, which includes health care, food stamps and an adequate child tax credit.

0,"cwg, Glad to have you back Although I still do not feel as you and the Acton Institute do. Also I think Trump may just finally settle at least some of these questions about the intrinsic value of money and the GOP worship thereof. For me it is truly amazing how the GOP mixes patriotism, religion and money with Trickle-down economics of the ancient British variety with the devastation of human life. No doubt Trump will be a very interesting prez if we survive. The American Catholic hierarchs certainly wanted him to win the election. Now we'll watch how soon they will repudiate him and/or excuse themselves. IF Trump does good things for the American workers and their families it still will not excuse his nasty way of winning the election. But at least the people will be better off.

My point was that he fought for the American people in a different type of war and shouldn’t be disparaged as a “draft dodger”. Trump has defined America’s enemies and put them on notice.  He has released the military generals from the control of the political civilians and lawyers conducting the fight from their desks in DC.  That is why the MOAB bomb was dropped, destroying a complex tunnel system in one afternoon. ISIS flourished after Obama’s Iraqi retreat. I give him no credit for regaining what he lost.

0,"Now that both Ontario and BC have acted to put some curbs on foreign speculators, it will become apparent to residents that foreigners were only a small part of the affordability problem and markets will resume rising after adjusting to the new taxes and rules.  We have had house price run-ups many times in the past and it's always due to local behaviors of the resident people. Sellers withdraw from the market and buyers chase a vanishing supply that they can afford.  This ends when some economic shock, like a recession ( or upcoming USA trade restrictions) dumps sellers into a market while potential buyers lack confidence or the ability to step up and buy. That's really the only time that homes get 'affordable' but note that boom or bust it's never easy to take that first step into the market. Of course governments have tended to do things that favor rising prices, and unless the area's population falls, homes remain a good investment over the long term.

0,"Here's another take, HR, The 2nd Amendment clearly states that the right of the people to keep and bear arms exists solely as a caveat to the fact that a Militia is necessary to the security of a free state. It mandates strict gun control laws and regulations in order to ensure that the people are keeping and bearing arms in a well regulated militia to ENSURE THE SECURITY OF A FREE STATE. The right of the people to bear arms, therefore, CANNOT exist in a system of unregulated and indiscriminate mass distribution of arms to the unregulated masses among whom are those who will use them in mass shootings and violent crime (by definition the exact opposite of a secure free state). We bear arms so not to live in fear, but if the bearing of arms is not regulated, then the consequences are that the people are living in fear. Living in fear is not freedom; it is Tyranny, the very thing that necessitated the creation of the United States, the Constitution and its Amendments. Best, RTD

Jesus also was quick to point out that John the Baptist did not wear the fine clothing of those in palaces.

In THE ENCYCLOPEDIA of EARLY CHRISTIANITY there is a whole article about the """"Election to Church Office"""" [by Everett Ferguson, 1997].

The person pulling the trigger , making the bomb , driving the truck or car into a crowd---we can't predict which person will do that. No law written on paper can stop it.  Look how many are gunned down in Chicago each year---thousands more than all these incidents put together .   Most aren't killed by assault rifles . So which guns do you ban ?  And even if you do---do you think criminals or crazy people aren't going to find them somewhere ?  And what about the latest tactics of using cars and trucks ? How do you stop that ?   We still live in the freest and safest country in the world .  There is absolutely nothing that can be done to stop crazy people.  Thinking  new laws or bans will stop it is more crazy than the people doing the shooting.

It's possible to place facilities so deep to preclude destroying them, but hope they have multiple exits, or they could be trapped by the debris. Some in the US military simply don't care about technical details (like the public), as they are not interested or their job doesn't require it, at least until the threat of war is real.  As for the spelling of pre-emptive, there is not total consensus on the internet, but is manini to focus on that, as you know what I meant and no one including you are a perfect speller, otherwise you wouldn't be using a spell checker?

0,"Spoke with an executive with United Health Care in Minnesota-- he feels we are headed to single payer/private insurance like Medicare once Republicans get rid of Obamacare. His point is that Republicans do not like Obamacare because it requires government subsidies for insurance companies and for people unable to afford insurance. They want to let insurance companies price policies at """"market"""". But he says that if insurance companies price economically, then premiums would be $30,000 or even $100,000 per year for many depending on their risk of current or future disease, otherwise insurance companies will lose money. DNA testing will soon determine risk of people for diseases like Diabetes and cancer which will make the cost of insurance even higher for many. For example, cancer treatments can cause $50,000 per year, but can be as high as $100,000 a year, so your policy would cost you $60,000 or $75,000 a year in premium or very high deductibles. Or you will go bankrupt or die.

We still have a legislature that costs us $70 million per year.  Their bloated budget pays for all sorts of wasteful spending, from excessive travel (like trips to Paris and Turkey), massive per diem payments (sometimes for legislators to sleep in their own beds), to an exclusive legislator- only restaurant.

MBAs learn skills that can help you financially engineer results to meet those incentives.  We give the board too much of a free ride. They are compensated well and define the incentive scheme and the characteristic of their ideal CEO.  Their share compensation allows them to participate handsomely on the upside and their retainers are approach $500k now.  Yet when things fail, the CEO and shareholders are on the hook with little criticism of the board that set the direction.  Ultimate the CEO just executes what the board sets.

This is extremely important.  And if the accord can keep mean temperatures below a  2-degrees C rise, that is a huge accomplishment. (Trump claims that a 1 degree reduction is minuscule. It's not. It's huge. But why am I not surprised. Trump, a racist, wants to destroy every trace of the Obama presidency.) The fight against climate change has to be total. Yet at the same time economies cannot simply be sacrificed. Political recklessness can result in social chaos, which, tragically, is already happening. The US has always been a huge political hurdle. In my book Fools Rule, Inside the Failed Politics of Climate Change, I recommended that the world turn its back on the U.S. since its primeval politics will never allow Congress to commit to a global climate treaty.

Public employees (law enforcement or school employees) force their employers to pay for their mistakes or criminal actions. The school district is held liable for failing to protect a student. The real shame is the lady was only sentenced to 20 months and community service. I've known parents to be sentenced to five years for spanking their child. This lady struck an at risk student, and further assaulted that student by spraying a foreign agent in their eyes, risking the students eyesight. Why she wasn't charged with felony child abuse is beyond explanation.

But when someone comes along like Putin, a guy who nightmarishly embodies what these conservatives claim to loathe--but a Liberal speaks out against the Putin?--well, then, an angle has to be found. A Liberal can never be praised for doing the right thing. So, we get this nonsense about Trudeau pandering to the Ukrainian vote and charges of socialism levelled at Wynne and Notley instead.....while Putin's abuses of power at home and abroad remain chilling by any reasonable standard.

Given the above, it's a rational decission to have fewer kids.  I'm an immigrant who arrived here at 32, we only have one kid, who will turn 18 this year. I wanted 3 kids, we could afford one. We have one.  Until the government starts taxing the rich more and the poor/middle class less, this will continue. Negative taxation for the poor is appealing, more so than guaranteed income.

Finally, the renowned Pasteur Institute in France, decided a few years ago to publish all its research material in English which is really a mongrelized language.

0,"While reading this article I felt the writer was spending a lot of time trying to convince readers that opposition to religious symbolism in politics amounts to xenophobia. And then, near the end of the piece, he hints at the actual crux of the matter, which is that Singh is a devout Sikh whose religiously-grounded social values infuse his policy choices, such as his opposition to Ontario's new sex-ed curriculum. This, I believe, is the problem with displaying religiosity in politics as it implies that church and state can't and won't be separated by fundamentalist politicians. Canada is mainly a socially progressive country, where religious fundamentalism is distrusted. Even Harper had to keep his party's Christian social conservatives out of the spotlight to gain and hold power. So maybe Quebec's leftists aren't particularly different from most voters in the rest of Canada in their perspective on religion in politics. To label them as xenophobes seems to me to miss the point.

He will find numerous """"No Trespasing"""" signs and signs that indicate the police can arrest anyone found on the property, all added as a result of increased crime that came after the rest stops came in.  In the Whiteaker, which bears the brunt of the Rest Stops since there is no public space in Trainsong, (they are literally across the street from our neighborhood and in it), we are simply overwhelmed. The Rest Stops themselves aren't so much the problem as is the fact that they add enough homeless to our neighborhood to push our concentration of homeless people up to 20% of the population.  I'm all in favor of adding Rest Stops in other neighborhoods. However, the six camps in/next to the Whiteaker really need to go elsewhere. Even without them, we'll still have a population that is over 15% homeless, which will still lead the nation.  Disperse, then expand. It's that simple.

In this case I believe that there is another potential outcome-to split-up the Democratic and Republican parties. I believe that pre-pledged delegates will force the progressive democrat to vote their conscience in the general election. Bernie supporters will fracture the democratic party by voting for Bernie and the """"anyone but Trump or Hillary""""  voters will fracture the Republican party when they vote for Bernie.

With bracing candor, the brilliant, charismatic, and uncompromising author of the bestselling Infidel and Nomad argues that it is foolish to insist, as our leaders habitually do, that the violent acts of Islamic extremists can be divorced from the religious doctrine that inspires them.

In fact , Obama entered into an agreement with Iran whereby they have been guaranteed entry into the nuclear power club in ten years. NK is about one up-man-ship. They did not want to wait 10 years for Iran to give them what they have now got by their own efforts. Obama left the gate wide open . I also respectfully suggest that the media who are hellbent to frustrate Trump in his efforts are perhaps even more to blame for the NK problem than Obama. Socialism exists only so long as the funding from capitalism exists. Funding from capitalism only exists when the capitalists are receiving adequate ROCE to ensure their sustainability and provide the excess required for socialism.  There is a correlation here with the 7/11 terrorist bombing of the twin tower's in Bush's first year. His predecessor failed totally

0,"Andreas,  Apparently we failed to connect on this question (possibly we did not construe """"world divisions the same way?).  So let me try to explain this somewhat differently.  Last time I checked (not this year) the two largest sources of funds for the GC were Brazil and the US of A.  On a Divisional basis, North America and South America are net donors to the GC.  Most other Divisions are net recipients of GC funds.  The entire GC budget is voted in US Dollars.  That includes both North American """"home"""" operations and also overseas """"world"""" appropriations.  When the value of the Brazilian Real drops against the US Dollar after the budget is voted, this creates a problem.  """"If it hurts don't do it.""""  If voting overseas appropriations in US Dollars is hurting the GC budgeting process, then perhaps vote them partly in Dollars and partly in Reals?  Or in some other basket of currencies that is less volatile than Dollars and Reals?  Hedge our currency rate vulnerability.

0,"But it wasn't dark. The article states that the collision took place at 5:45 AM. Sunrise is at 6:15 AM. Many (most?) states define the """"hours of darkness"""" (the time one must use headlights/tail-lights) as between 30 minutes after sunset to 30 minutes before sunrise. Oregon is more conservative and requires lights be on from sunset to sunrise, but the fact is that 30 minutes before sunrise it is plenty light out and far from dark.  I suspect that more than one person involved in this crash was playing with a vibrating toy (cell phone). Odd that the article mentions something about the pedestrian's clothing, but doesn't mention whether or not the police are investigating distraction on the part of the motorist. If you can drive along and not see a person, even when they are crossing against the light, you are either unfit to drive, distracted or both.

I recall a great blog by Gwyn Morgan in 2016, discussing the importance of addressing demand as a mechanism to reducing fossil fuel use, but as is typical, he was mocked and vilified by the enviro-nazis, because of his previous involvement with the oilpatch.  The answer, imo, to reducing humankind's carbon footprint (more importantly, pollution footprint) is education and action at a grass-roots level. The time-tested three R's, making do with less and mindful use of all resources while increasing use of alternative energy sources as they become more readily available, is the only prudent way forward.  Forcing alternatives prematurely is expensive and unproductive, as Ontario has learned. And since governments everywhere assess fiscal health by retail sales - essentially the accumulation of """"stuff"""", a re-think of that approach is in order.

And, we have chosen to heavily subsidize the local school from church offering money.  If, as a result of Point 1 above, we have fewer people invested in the life of the local church, then in practical terms, we have killed the Goose that Laid the Golden Egg - and subsidy money will no longer be able to flow from the church to the school.  3.  Traditionally, in the history of our church, the local school was viewed as a contributing party in the larger evangelistic outreach of the church - not as the prime and often sole type of evangelism of the church.  Sadly, most studies of the church have revealed that when a church begins to make the conversion of their children their primary form of evantelism, the church quickly begins to wither and die.  On the other hand, when the children are actively, regularly involved in the life of the church, both flourish.

The internal combustion engine is dramatically more efficient than even five years ago such that, even without any government subsidized shift to EVs, GHG emitted from cars will continue to diminish as old is replaced with new.  And that's great news!  We don't need Volvo's EV cars and we certainly don't need hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars funding new Volvos and Teslas (for the wealthy) with minimal GHG reduction.  Agreed?

These are the legal bases upon which the federal government owns any federal land that it, through Congress, acquires from foreign nations and decides to retain in federal ownership. Besides, as a matter of contract, the State of Alaska specifically disclaimed any right to federal land that was not granted to it in the Statehood Act.  Look it up, and then tell us how the State could claim any federal land now owned in Alaska by the US without violating the Statehood contract.

My initial feeling is that the fire hysteria will fade and we will be back to business as usual.

If China still finds Kim useful, there is little that can be done; at only 33 years old, he can continue his blackmail for decades, South Korea and Japan his hostages. His end would have to come from within, from the suicidal intervention of a rogue bodyguard or humiliated general or hired assassin. But then what? The North is nuclear now.

It's a Roman Rite theological/doctrinal thing, God being male and all that.  It seems so strange that so many Catholics believe that this will someday change.  Do reform Catholics really think that Roman theology/doctrine will be changed to reflect the equality of genders...when even Pope Francis refuses to consider any kind of doctrinal change?  Of course, pastoral change is easier as it flows with the pope in power, but pastoral change doesn't last like doctrine does.  We need a Vatican II Rite Church in union with Rome, whether Rome likes it or not.  And Rome needs that Rite/Church if ever Catholicism is to regain any credibility.  Google Rite Beyond Rome.

Over the years, tax strategy grew from a slight pushing of the envelope to all sorts of schemes, pushed by tax planners and advisors who are looking for the edge over other advisors and knowing that CRA has little resources to fight and delve into the legalities. What I do is totally legal, but I don't believe it is in the spirit of equality or fairness from the average taxpayer's view. The money that has slipped under the radar from various tax loss schemes, to family trusts/income splitting, to off-shore companies and investments has gotten way out of hand.

Tens of thousands of POWs from allied nations and from China would continue to be starved, raped, tortured to death, and even eaten as the war raged on. This was an instance where nuclear detonation likely saved countless Japanese lives and helped bring an end to the suffering from unthinkable acts perpetrated by the emperor’s “spirit warriors.” We wish it hadn't had to happen, and we can be sorry for the actions we were forced to take, but an open apology flys in the face of history.

0,"Bob,  You're correct that there isn't some precise definition of poverty that can be applied to assess the circumstances of each person in any location in Canada at all times.  Happily, no one is actually seeking such a definition; only trying to identify populations of people that have an unusually difficult lack of material resources and prospects needed to cope with their life circumstances when compared with others in their community.  Further, this is not to say that when such sorting of populations for analysis purposes are made, some counted as in poverty are managing to do better than assumed or that others above the poverty line are failing.  Such analysis is focussed upon broad social patterns and trends and uses such definitions merely as a sorting tool to facilitate comparisons.  What income a young family of 4 living in downtown Vancouver would need to have access to adequate housing, food, health care, work, etc. will differ from that of a similar family in Thunder Bay.

0,"Putting aside emotion, there were 2 valid reasons for continuing with some sort of litigation and/or inquiry re: Khadr  1.  The case is without precedent, and it is important to establish the benchmark judgments for similar cases in the future, as well as if any financial compensation is warranted, and if so, how much.  What did get established is that Charter rights extend outside Canada, and that repatriation is not a Charter right.  At any given moment there are several thousand Canadian citizens locked up in foreign prisons worldwide, many of which also engage in torture etc.   Is the expectation now that each is eligible for around $10M if they happen to have contact with a Canadian official who didn't do things perfectly?  2.  To deter future would-be terrorists/traitors by demonstrating that there's little to be gained.  Unfortunately, by circumventing the process, any savings today could be eclipsed by hundreds of millions in future payouts based on the precedent set.

My ordination class - 13: 40th anniversary coming up - four are still active; one in retirement 8 left - know of only one who applied and was laicized.

Why work so hard for someone else just to end up with less money?  An innovator/leader in a company paid a salary/bonus loses so much to tax, they are incented to do less as a contractor (having less impact) to take home more money.

However, Zosimus himself died in late 418 and Pelegius tried to reopen the case again. This time Augustine used lay contacts (and a hefty bribe) at the imperial court to come down against Pelagius.  Thus, the actuality is that Rome spoke several times, saying different things, and the case was not settled for several years.

There are about 55,000 illegal aliens here in Denver out of a population of 700,000 according to Pew. Getting rid of them will reduce school overcrowding, increase the availability of affordable housing, improve the outrageous traffic situation and reduce the indigent burden on Denver Health.

A 1-2 percent raise would barely be felt by those coming here in comparison to an extension of a tax that disproportionately hurts those that can't afford to pay the tax in the first place (those living paycheck to paycheck and those that are in poverty.)  A rise in hotel resort fees haven't made a dent in our tourism numbers, so why would a modest rise in the TAT tax be any different?  Bottom line is we have heard these excuses before and Tourism here in Hawaii is doing just fine.  I highly doubt that people are going to stop coming to Hawaii in droves just because it costs $1-2 more dollars per $100 spent to get a hotel room.

My tax rate is around 20%, which seems very fair considering all the government-funded resources and infrastructure I regularly take advantage of (and those that have gotten me to where I am). I choose to focus on all that I get for my taxes, rather than the services I am not eligible to receive. I just can't stand that many fiscal conservatives choose to vilify and demean those that receive government assistance. You often have a valid argument, just present it without picking on a particular group. You will be amazed how much more receptive people will be. Just my $0.02.

0,"Right thing??? Pfft... We have a budget reserve of 13+ billion, with an annual budget of 4.5 not currently funded. That comes out to a 1,040 day budget reserve. That's assuming that oil prices don't go back up along with production. That may not seem like much for a reserve, but the US state average daily budget reserve is 24 days reserve. Alaska has the highest day budget reserve of any state, and by over 900 days from the second highest. What good does it do our economy to have money setting in a government budget reserve not circulating thru the economy?  The right thing to do here, is look at a back up plan for when the budget reserve dips below a certain point, like say a 90 day reserve, an income tax kicks in, when the reserve increases beyond 120 day reserve, the income tax stops. If the budget reserve increases beyond 180 day reserve, income tax refund to the residents.  There is no good reason to have a budget reserve this big.

The fact is Xmas is no longer celebrated as a religious holiday, it has become commercialized and part of popular culture all over the world without religious connotations, while most other religious holidays ARE celebrated as religious holidays of specific religions, they are not secular.

While there are other faith traditions that may possess elements of truth, its fullness resides in that Church founded by Jesus.  One may certainly choose not to believe that, but many of the faith traditions to which you point engender far more incredulity than a monotheistic faith with a personal God.  Yes, there is no certainty in some instances, like the fate of the individual unbaptized, for example.  But that which is key to our salvation, like our relationship with God the Father or the resurrection of Jesus are just a few of those certainties to which Christians can point as touchstones to their faith.  Far from patronizing, it is recognizing that all are called to this relationship and God has granted a way for them (and us) to answer that call.

These Liberal judges have NO interest in interpreting and enforcing the law.

0,"This is a really interesting time in our history: How are Alaskans going to wean themselves from oil income and build the government that they really want? We are blessed that we can now sustainably draw $2.5 billion annually from the earnings of the Permanent Fund every year to fund the State Government in lieu of taxes (without depleting the corpus of the Fund). Yes we might need to chip in a little more to top it off or draw from savings a little longer but who knows? Maybe in the future our Di-Lithium Crystal mines will give us one more resource development boom.  I must also say that creating endowments to fund the dividend program are not legal and a complete waste of time. Under the law, you cannot create a dedicated fund such as this. The legislature should vote every year on the dividend amount based on how much we can afford. And forget an income tax until you reform the dividend benefit """"purpose"""".

0,"The editorial distorts the historical record by failing to mention the consular assistance that Canada rendered to Mr. Khadr from the time of his capture.

So much easier to ignore what happened and simply parrot the government line.  Also ignored is the historical context when Canada decided to interrogate Mr. Khadr, i.e. the fact it had troops on the ground in Afghanistan. What about the argument that Canada's constitution required it to assist those soldiers by gaining whatever intelligence it could from Mr. Khadr in order to assist its troops in the prosecution of the war and to enhance their chances of returning home safe and sound?  Reasonable people can disagree but one can make a plausible argument that when one takes the historical context into account Mr. Khadr should have received vastly less in the way of damages, i.e. a dollar.

Ms. Stillwell than told the poor that she had once been on social assistance. and now she is a big politico and olympic athelete...when Ms.Stilwell's situation was far different from those who have to beg or steal  or turn to petty crime to get enough to eat.

What do these tax and spend people think the reserve fund's purpose is? It is to fill in the gaps when revenues decline. Use of the permanent fund is there for a similar purpose. And when one considers there is nearly 60 Billion in these accounts how can anyone in good conscious argue for a state income tax. The proper mix is to to use  part of the revenue from the PFD , impose a  gaso tax, impose a seasonal sales tax exempting food and utilities, and look for other ways to eliminate non essential spending by the Govt. Such a simple solution, yet it seems big spenders want more from us.

And the story of the business man who came to Eugene with possible plans, but after seeing the conditions in the downtown, simple returned to the airport and left the area.  The other half of the equation are all the pending property tax bonds and levies.  The city wants a pools & parks bond, 4j wants a whooping levy, the country wants to renew the jail levy, and in the meantime the city wants to forfeit more general fund revenue by issuing more MUPTEs and extending the URD.  NONE of this makes housing more affordable, instead it make housing LESS affordable.  Now throw-in rent control...  Sadly, it almost makes me want to laugh.

I did find one cite on the UK which stated the average time between a person being charged, and the resolution of the case is ten weeks. Imagine that. You can't even get a trial date within a year in Canada and they have the guy already sentenced within ten weeks. Why? Is it more money? More judges? More courts? More streamlined courts? Better laws? Where are the journalists getting off their lazy butts and getting this information out to the public?

0,"Trump doesn't listen to the people he has no intention of representing. His only goal is self-enrichment at the expense of the environment, or anything else that gets in his way.  Those foolish enough to believe Trump cares about the environment or jobs is a joke, as he sticks with supporting the fossil fuel industry over our country's economic growth as a leader of the swiftly growing alternative energy industry.  Trump purposely ignores the fact that there are now more jobs in the solar industry as in either the coal or oil and gas industries; in fact, solar jobs are growing faster than other jobs in our economy. The bureau of labor statistics notes that wind turbine technicians are the fastest growing job for the next decade.  https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/us-solar-industry-employees-grows-oil-gas  Trump's actions to isolate our country and alienate our allies destroys decades of building up the strength of our alliances plays directly into Putin's hands.

Average household size is 2.7 people, so each household would average $14,792 in sales taxes.  The average household income is $70,000.  If you spent every dime you made on taxable stuff, the tax rate would need to be 21%.

One is (I am) always disappointed when Benedict is quoted in some context or other like this because he did more to bring down the church in our time than any save Cardinal Law, perhaps. Notice the complete absence of any mention of the Bishops Pastoral on Social Justice. This present crop was handpicked by JPII and unless you read PEOPLE OF GOD by Penny Lernoux you are not going to know how JPII worked to undo the work of the Spirit in that era of church history.

0,"Yes, having it on paper is a major legal advantage when your legal disputes are settled in Western Courts. Now even there a  verbal contract is a legally valid contract - it's just hard to prove the contents. In theory witness statements should have swung the case, but unfortunately it's quite easy for those with wealth and power to get any number of witnesses who will say whatever they want them to say. Nevertheless- the problem was with proving ownership, not with *lack* of ownership as the original comment alleged. A verbal contract is still a legal contract, and a gift is still a legal transfer of ownership. Even westerners use this system all the time. Surely you don't include a tax invoice every time you buy a relative a birthday present?  But no sane judge will take your side if you try to take that present back the next day.

To deal with cases, the involved parties could either negotiate a settlement out of court or take it to a panel made up of three US-appointed judges, three Iranian-appointed judges, and three neutral judges. The panel would then hear the case and issue a binding ruling. . The Obama administration decided to settle out of court. .

They welcomed more than 30,000 Syrian refugees, moved forward on their environmental agenda, advanced assisted dying, appointed more independent-minded senators and looked to legalize marijuana. The deficit was larger than promised but their priority was to invest in infrastructure, and at the same time, they managed to come to agreement with the provinces on health care (except Manitoba).""""  I can't really see anything in there that's positive and good for the middle class and Canada other than the assisted dying.. All I see is spending and taxes. Not a great deal of positive work done.

Assuming corruption in every instance might be going too far, but I have seen first hand how student access programs (+ cash of less than clear origin) are being used to secure a path to residency and then a form of hedge citizenship for entire families.

While the PM's bizarre and embarrassing take on our history, heritage and identity is the antithesis of national pride and patriotism and unworthy of a person entrusted to lead this country, it is entirely in keeping with the rest of Trudeau's shallow sound bite attempts at philosophizing.  The PM once bragged about how he doesn't watch the news on TV or read it in the newspapers because """"if something important happens someone will tell me about it"""".  Regretfully, he seems to have taken the same insular approach to reading and thinking about Canada's proud history.  While neither Canada nor any nation has an unblemished history, this country is rightly considered to be among the freest, most open, tolerant and democratic in the world.

I would have thought that this would have been an argument for free trade not a tariff war.

Republicans have been traditionally a free trade party and I can only hope that  Trump's own party will prevent him from proceeding with the border tax policy.

The legislators could all use personal cell phones and deduct the expense off their federal taxes so no more phone bills. No more moving expenses for legislators.  Let them have $100 for postage.  They can do their own research which will save the state millions. Close the legislative lounge unless the legislators wish to buy the food out of their per diem, cook and serve it to themselves and the general public.  Might just turn a profit that way.

The new license increase was intended so all GF money could be cut and it would be once again self funded.  The last conversation I had with leadership, they where expecting to loose all GF money withing the next couple years.  The new license and tag fee increase, along with a bounty of Pittman-Robertson Federal money (generated from a tax on sporting goods) will more than make up for loosing all GF money.  There may be a few small things that are not eligible for License or PR money but I stand by my statement that Wildlife Division is largely user funded.

These were the original populist parties and they certainly did not threaten democracy. In fact, the crushing power of capital over farmers and labour is what bore out these parties. Indeed, populism played a role in mobilizing support for the Nazi party. But keep in mind, there were populist Canadian parties too that emerged simultaneously that were not threats to democracy. I suggest these writers brush up on their history.

0,"Wouldn't it make more sense to simply reverse earlier changes that made it possible for professionals to avoid taxes by structuring themselves as LLC's.  As much as doctors, dentists, lawyers and accountants would like us to believe they are small business persons, they are not.  They are service providers.  They do not have invested capital in means of production, nor do they generate meaningful employment.  Sharing an office and staff with several other professionals, each structured as an LLC does not a small business make.   By going after all small business in order to tax the true income of professionals seems short sighted and disruptive.

Airbnb is enticing people to rent rooms or attached units for prices higher than monthly rentals: $25-170 a room a night per web site for our area. Buyers are moving here from CA and elsewhere saying that they want a place to rent to .. Airbnb travelers.  Perhaps we could tax landlords temporarily and Airnnb to raise $ for affordable housing to rent or buy.  Since over 50% of housing is non-owner occupied, could we design a financial vehicle that would relieve some of ownership responsibilities but still provide a long term income?

This is a very regressive move, and if you don't understand what it is, or why it is, you don't understand why women marched in such numbers.  He also strongly advocates protectionism. That is so injurious to lower and middle-class Americans  (and beneficial to his wealthy fellow billionaires!) that it should never be allowed to see the light of day.  He uses fear, lies, bullying and deception to achieve his goals. So it's not just what he does, but how he does it that people don't like. They don't just want Trump to stop using his wealth and power to stop grabbing women by the pu$$y, but he's grabbing America by the private parts and they want him to stop right now.  They want him to show respect, speak plainly and honestly, think rationally, and act responsibly. They want Trump to be a president, not an embarrassing and dangerous village idiot.

0,"Another excellent article, and a good discussion too. Thanks.  I lived for six months in a town which had a Cathedral and a Franciscan Friary. The Cathedral drew a lot of its Sunday congregation from tourists (its a very fine, ornate building.) It was mostly half empty for each of the Sunday Masses, however. It was run by diocesan clergy.  The Franciscan Friary, on the other hand, was standing room only. I don't think there was a difference in sermons. You'd hear traditional and modern viewpoints expressed in both churches. The liturgies were very alike, except for one thing. The Cathedral had the normal offertory collection, and often times a 'special' collection after communion.  The Franciscan Friary had no collection at Sunday Mass. These guys announced when the electricity bill came in and told the congregation how much it was. Paid! They did this with everything and led lives trusting God and his people.  People, Catholic or whatever, will support 'faith' when they see it.

It would, quite literally, destroy our nation. 2) This is an extention of (1), we must limit immigration.  and 3) clearly, if we're to allow any immigration, we must be comfortable that those immigrants are not a threat to our nation.

I must add that, IMO, Mr. Trump's positions go far beyond these three questions of concern.  regards, Gary

0,"An overwhelming proportion of community members support a refinement plan process, with the initial step being led by a Planning Team comprised of members of the affected area, following direction by City Council to produce a draft proposal for a new refinement plan.  At the September 19, 2016 public forum there were 39 individuals who presented oral testimony. Twenty-five individuals explicitly stated support for a refinement plan (or have stated their support in the past, e.g., Christine Sundt). Only five WE CAN sealots spoke in support of an alternative, city-wide committee as the next step. (See below.)  More compelling is the petition in support of a refinement plan signed by 600 individuals.  In addition, the board of all four of the affected neighborhood organizations voted to support the letter from the Council of South Eugene Neighborhoods, which supported a refinement plan.  There is simply no justification for acting as if this is a “divided” community. It's 100-to1 ratio.

0,"Much in the same way SB21 lacked any supporting evidence that lower state production taxes would increase the production rate of north slope oil, this claim that capping Permanent Fund Dividend checks provides any fiscal benefit to state finances lacks any supporting evidence.  [The debate about oil taxes should center on the VALUE; past, present and future expected. Limiting the discussion to production rates was intentionally misleading.]  In fact, taking $700M in anticipated cash out of circulation from the wider state economy is a punitive act intended to punish voters (whose votes have been diluted by gerrymandering) and again, has no basis in any valid theory linking state fiscal problems to household incomes or cash windfalls.  Punishing voters for the venality of the legislative majority (and governor) is like beating your dog because you got cut off in traffic.  Whoever is advising governor Walker to do this is someone who completely fails to understand macroeconomics.

That clown signed a paper without having any clue what the repercussions to our economy would be or have a strategy in place to lower emissions. Later we find he excused Ontario by maintaining manufacturing and only make it responsible for engineering more fuel efficient cars while AB, SK, BC, NS, and NL all had to do the heavy lifting by destroying their carbon-based industries.

The ownership of that property has never been in question, at least not for the last 148 years. The only piece of property the Sioux have been seriously disputing is the Black Hills that were taken by the Treaty of 1877 that the Sioux, rightfully, dispute due to the fact that it was done in violation of section 2 of the Treaty of 1868 that requires that any new modifications had to be agreed upon by a majority of the Sioux Nations. It was not agreed upon and is nowhere near the area where the pipeline is being built. The ownership of the property is not in question and has not been since 1868.

Steve Rieger had an excellent op-ed the other day as to why doing so is bad public policy.  I agree. It essentially appears to transfer the entire financial risk of oil revenue dependence from the state to individual Alaskans.  In my opinion, this is a huge mistake.  Rather than permanently putting an end to the Permanent  Fund dividend as we know it, the Legislature should keep the current structure and ANNUALLY - not just once as proposed by McGuire- determine how much of the earnings reserve is needed for the general fund and how much can be distributed to Alaskans.  P.s. A sales tax, especially if it applies to rent and food, is a very regressive tax.
"
0,"rockydays: I'm skeptical about the willingness of the CPC to seriously address the issue. Under Harper, there were some minor tweaks, particularly to the refugee program, but the mass immigration scheme was mainly left intact and the foreign worker program was broadened (although reined in a bit before the last federal election, after it became a political liability). I suspect the CPC won't budge very much from a corporate-focused agenda, where the immigration and temporary worker programs are seen as means of suppressing labour costs. Interestingly, the CPC's Australian counterpart (although nominally labelled as Liberal, but in reality a centre-right party), fearful of losing power, is currently tightening immigration, temporary worker and citizenship rules. Perhaps the CPC will wait to see how that strategy works out?

It is this ideology that requires that women wear Burkas.

As well as the issues associated with gearing up US manufacturing again, there is the issue of consumer prices. For many, many years now people have been used to rock bottom prices that came about for the very reason that countries like China, Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam have been producing goods made by people earning next to nothing and with no benefits - the uber-capitalist dream! If Trump slams on big tariffs or bans imports then prices will escalate enormously in the US almost overnight and it is the poorer people in the US that will feel the pinch the most - the very people that Trump claims to represent and be working for. A sudden, massive drop in exports to the US could also destabilise countries like Mexico which is already having a lot of troubles.

The two liberal tax and spend lawmakers, Gardner & Begich don't even mention the need to cut spending. 2) consider a seasonal sales tax that exempts groceries and utilities. 3) Utilize the income from the PF in such a way that it contributes needed revenues. Read former legislator Wilken's article. Last year the fund earned over 5 billion dollars. No need to make Alaskans pay an income tax. This might reduce the dividend somewhat,  but there will be one and it will still be significant. 4) Hand Walker, Mallot, Gardner, Begich, and the rest of the House majority their hats.

Disobeying a lawful order given to you by a LEO is a breaking the law. Whether he attempted to kill the LEO is immaterial since he made the effort to escape and by doing so, endangering the LEO. If the LEO feel that he is in danger, he can terminate that danger any way he see fits. And his fellow LEOs can aid him on that enterprise. Either way, your logic is flawed because you think that he has that right to escape. (LEO stands for law enforcement officer(s).) Proper thing for this gentleman to do was simply surrender and throw himself at the mercy of the court. How simple, eh?

Obama has purposely weakened the military and diminished U.S. influence while emboldening its enemies, like Iran seizing American sailors, and now flush with cash,  providing sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels and other assorted terrorist organizations since foolishly having sanctions lifted. Iran and its proxy Hezbollah have constructed a ballistic missile base in Syria near the Israeli border, greatly magnifying an already explosive situation. Obama has set up WW3 so the uncomfortable truth that indicts him is the real issue and not commitments to NATO by a man who isn't president yet.

1,"Journalists?  Columnists seem to be much more common than journalists these days.  When was the last time you read an article that gave full, clear and detailed information, and allowed the reader to form his own opinion?  Even news articles are far more likely to espouse an opinion, and to provide only such information as will support that narrative.  Opinion, no matter how well sourced, is still opinion.  After all, the reader doesn't know what sources the writer has carefully not used.  I am also reminded of a comment that I have heard in many forms over the years - if everything is an urgent, level one, top priority emergency, then nothing is.  Put another way, if everything we read about politicians in general accuses them of being liars or unprincipled self-serving scoundrels, then that becomes normal, and it is unreasonable to expect people to take notice of the latest scandal involving the latest scoundrel.

If the """"carrying"""" of firearms was the real problem, this Nation would have degraded into anarchy long before today.  It was only a few years ago Senior High School students, who could drive, might have a rifle in the back window for after school use or for their firearm safety class taught during school time, and no one died because of it.  So the firearm is not the problem.  The problem stems from a very small portion of our society which has degraded faster than the majority.  Much like a front tire wearing out faster than rear because the car is out of alignment.  Society is out of alignment!  Stop excusing bad behavior and demand respect.  Respect for others,  the Law and reward disrespect with punishment!

1,"Underlying much of that subconscious racial bias is the most enduring, corrosive racial stereotype in America: the black-as-criminal mindset. Historian David Levering summarizes it:  “Whites commit crimes but blacks are criminals.” While whites can and do commit a great deal of minor and major crimes, the race as a whole is never tainted by those acts.  But when blacks violate the law, all members of the race are considered suspect. Remember Zimmerman’s false syllogism? A few blacks committed burglary, Trayvon was black, therefore Trayvon was a criminal.  Similar logic is used daily in the assumptions police and citizens make about African Americans, especially young males. Lisa Bloom 2014.

Further, if this motion is to be passed, should we also condemn any disagreement with fundamentalist Christian groups (especially criticism that uses inflammatory words such as """"fundamentalist Christians""""), including those with kooky ideas, as """"hatred against Christians""""?

0,"Since when does deprivation cause a person to be holy.  The idea that even priests should not marry or remarry if their wives die is a cause of the very poor theology coming out of The RC church about marriage and sex.  JPII encyclical is a case in point.  He certainly did not have either the scientific  or psychological knowledge to write about this subject.  Too bad the members of the episcopacy believe they are some how omniscient and omnipotent when it comes to even rules.  They aren't  either.  The Apostolic requirements of the church is fulfilled by baptism not holy orders.  So it only take 2 present for ANY baptized person to preform Any sacrament.  The episcopacy only pretends to be little Caesars.  They are really monarchs without clothes.  Much of the laity has recognized just how disrespectful these men that run the church are.

The franchise draws fans and promotes the city through sports media. It’s nice to have for NFL fans but San Diego’s loss will be a gain in LA. Funding the subsidy through a hotel tax has merit. Vacancy rates will decrease for accommodation around the stadium. Bars and restaurants will also feel the hit. Liquor taxes and sales taxes from these businesses will decrease. It would be interesting to read a report that tries to estimate the economic benefit of the annual tax revenue for each of the Leafs, Raptors, and Jays. The $2 billion price tag in SD was for a stadium that would have been for civic show piece lasting a number of years. If the math works then there should be taxpayer support.

0,"Communism isn't just a social or economic ideology; it's also a philosophical and political ideology. There are various schools of thought, but they all advocate for the common ownership of all means of production (i.e. no private ownership).

The protestors never advocated against private ownership and are very far from the ideology of Marx.  The best example I can think of is it's analogous to labeling anyone who advocates for reduced immigration """"fascist."""" Yes, nationalism is the principle foundation of fascism, but just because someone thinks immigration should be limited, obviously doesn't mean they're fascist.

It would help create a more frugal government when all citizens had to pay the bills. I will never support an income tax of any kind, flat or progressive. All taxes start out small to get voted in. They always go up over the years. The income tax was adopted by Marx & Engels in their “Communist Manifesto” & is supported by socialist leaning people. They just don’t call themselves socialists. An income tax means the government decides how much of the fruits of my labor I am allowed to keep. In large part, it is a redistribution of the wealth from those who have earned it to those who have not earned it. It takes place in the form of government programs, subsidies & grants. It attacks private property rights which are at the very foundation of liberty & freedom. https://nccs.net/1996-03-answers-to-americas-tax-problems

And that's happened.  Did you know that Red Dog Creek, which drains the tailings pond, had to have a fish weir installed because the formerly naturally sterile creek has so many fish in it now after Red Dog Mine cleaned it up that they were trying to get into the tailings pond?

0,"The research paper is available online with a description of the methodology.  It only looks at CCPCs, so it appropriately excludes sole proprietors, to answer your question. There are two limitations that skew the data in opposite ways: (1) It only identifies income splitting if the participants share the same address, which would cut out some where adult children live on their own b/c they can't track it with the data they have.  This minimizes the potential impact. (2) It assumes that all the dividends are for income splitting.  So included in the 1/8 might be businesses where the family member works there, and their tax is not affected by this rule.  So the 1/8 might be too high b/c of this.  I'm not surprised the impact is low, and skews to high earners.  The tax benefit is bigger when you have family members in different tax brackets (and the bigger the difference, the better the tax benefit), which isn't as common anymore.

The lead ministry, Municipal Affairs, appears to have no enforcement/compliance personnel to ensure that PPS safety requirements are being followed.

Argument turns too easily into animosity.”  “It means that bigotry and white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed, and it means the very identity of our nation depends on passing along civic ideals.”  “Bullying and prejudice in our public life … provides permission for cruelty and bigotry.” “The only way to pass along civic values is to live up to them.”

I think Vatican II generated a great deal of excitement about what could be in the church.  And just as quickly as that hope was kindled, it was quashed while the old guard worked to buy time so that they could control the direction of whatever may have sprung from the Council.  The end result is that the younger generation of potential seminarians have grown up in a world wherein what was valued in the church was NOT that hope triggered by Vatican II, but by Machiavellian maneuvers to undo Vatican II, to and to rebuild the power of the clergy.  As such, I'm not at all surprised that what we've seen now for a few decades, are young men drawn by THOSE kinds of antics.  These guys have likely never experienced the kind of hope so many of us felt during and after Vatican II.

I did read that the remittance, in theory, only able to be spent on American goods in foreign nations, (feedback loop).     It might be a good theory, but if you're correct about the drug trade then they don't care about the law.  Interesting to see the perspective. Is it the user or the drug salesman who's to blame?

The local authorities, be they DA or ANC, can never keep up with the demand, and providing any service other than temporary simply is not possible, due to the layout of informal settlements. The people who live there should know that better than anyone else.  The real issue is a worldwide problem - economic migrations from rural or less viable urban area to viable urban areas. This issue is outside of the control of local authorities, who have to deal with the fallout of national government failure.  It's a fact. So how do we deal with it? Imo, because the users have no alternative, and because the authorities, how well intentioned or cynical they may be, can only do so much, it is in the users interest to at least keep their allocated cubicle clean.

0,"Interesting history lesson but doesn't explain why a few people do mass killings. Obviously mental illness is the core but still, most mentally ill people, don't kill others. The Chicago experience, where guns are outlawed, produces over 600 killings a year, from guns. Gun control seems pretty ineffective. In the most recent case, the dark state failed, gun controls were in place but both the air force and the mental hospital failed to report appropriately. Instead of political solutions, we need a deeper analysis of how to identify and stop the few.

Even though this hustle got sidetracked into the stupid rail project, tourism is going to continue to grow while Alaska keeps fumbling the economic ball by playing a zero sum economic game....wise up Hawaii Dem party bosses...

There is a serious error in this sentence:  """"Sweeping law reforms introduced by a brash young cabinet minister named Pierre Trudeau decriminalized homosexuality and abortion.""""   In fact, abortion was still a crime in 1967.   When Trudeau became prime minister, abortion became partially legalized in 1969, when a woman could plead with a committee to be allowed to  terminate a pregnancy.  Otherwise, abortion remained a crime until 1988 when the Supreme Court sided with Morgentaler and ruled that treating abortion as a crime was unconstitutional.

In this case """"crooked"""" appears to be an opinion. But we just debated whether calling Clinton """"a criminal"""" is a statement of fact. Criminal and crooked seem pretty close. So the question is: How far can online comments go? Though many people think words have distinct boundaries (falsely calling them """"definitions""""), they can be more fuzzy around the edges. If we can call a business owner crooked, can we call them a pervert under the guise of opinion. The problem as you note is not just buyer beware, but also reviewer beware.

Which begs the question: How much is this about parental influence and how much is about societal and generational influence?

There was a time when Catholics were less inclined to marry non-Catholics precisely because it was perceived as a potential problem in raising children. Those for whom raising their children Catholic were more diligent about dating only within the faith. It probably is still that way, the difference being that there are just fewer of those people today.

0,"its all good and well for the Concourt to have a made that judgement, ostensibly to protect the rights of """"tenants"""". But it certainly has not helped with the bigger picture.  Firstly they are not tenants, they are squatters. They are also not homeless, because they have occupied a building, outside of the law. But they will be homeless if evicted, in spite of the initial action of squatting being against the law.  The owners have abandoned their buildings because it is more profitable to do so, or it incurs less spending. Whatever.  One has to feel some sympathy for the city, who has to take action, because the CBD needs to be reinvented, which needs investment, which requires at least some measure of gentrification, which requires evictions, which requires building or providing alternatives, etc etc.  And all the while, the National Governmnent, who is primarily to blame for creating the economic circumstances forcing the migration in the first place, is nowhere to be seen or heard.

I do not understand Bitcoins, even though I have rad much on them,I cannot grasp the fundamentals but will buy the ETF when it is available.

0,"It would be good to get a few more parties in the picture.  But if abortion is your single issue I doubt that the Libertarians are the answer.  From their platform:  """"Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good-faith views on all sides, we believe that government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration.""""  Frankly, I find this to be a refreshing position.  Here are the other platform positions of the Libertarian party.  I find many of them appealing.  Others appalling.  But clearly a realistic choice: https://www.lp.org/platform

0,"American democracy is an odd duck that contains competing anarchistic and authoritarian strains. I'm not sure either can ever be completely extinguished. Trump's attempts at an imperial presidency will eventually be curbed by Congress and/or the courts and/or ordinary voters. What institutional mechanisms serve to similarly constrain China's leaders? Trudeau may admire China's """"basic dictatorship"""" but I suspect many others do not and never will.

It would seem Corker sees the writing on the wall, after another establishment RINO got slaughtered in a primary down in Alabama.  The swamp is beginning to drain.  We need to get conservatives who aren't about McConnel and the Washington establishment.

But I'm guessing that sooner or later cash currency will become much more restricted as the various tax collection systems much prefer retailer to institution to keep track of the transactions electronically.  Cash is expensive to produce, distribute and also the currency used by those engaged in nefarious operations.

1,"I can remember the rallies for JFK in urban black communities.  When is the last time you saw a campaign on foot in a poor black urban area by a white politician with a national profile?  For that matter when did you last see a major politician visiting a small rural community in Oregon.  The only thing they did in Iowa was stick a weed stalk in their mouth and sit on a bale of hay for photographers.  *Oh, they did pay attention to corporate farmers, their crop subsidies and their tax offsets.  Most Republican candidates  'equal rights' concerns, are often nothing more than protecting their own economic privilege.  I don't expect anymore than that, they general live up to my low expectation.  What hurts is Democratic lip service that has yet to transform these area's of great need.   They could try spending time in these homes, on these streets, talking with these families, but it's so much easier to make promises on TV or, send a check.  Sucks to be poor.

So maybe media's endless focus on """"help me government"""", help me, The World Is Ending and The Sky is Falling, is just aging boomers increasingly frightened by change as old people so often are Look at """"The Climate is Changing"""" nonsense.  Of course it is you sillies. That's what climate has always done. Jurassic? Now want Insurance that mitigates the cost of medicine and medical treatment for illness and injury changed to """"Health Care"""" like maintenance drugs to keep them alive despite sloth, overeating, and other health destroying pleasures of the life style to which they've been accustomed like wanting legal MJ. But hope springs eternal. For me it's that a new generation appears who, despite the declining education and indoctrination boomers have imposed since """"Why Johnny Can't Read"""" (60's), figures out they are all growed up. And get back to remaking the Earth to their liking. Not cower in fear of change

0,"I could not take this article seriously once I read the third paragraph. To consider canonizing a non-Catholic is absurd. Didn't Jesus say """"no one comes to the Father except through me"""" and """"unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you will have no life within you""""? The Church cannot proclaim with any certainty that a non-Catholic is a saint (i.e. in heaven). It is possible we may have a reasonable hope that non-Catholics enter heaven, and are therefore saints, but we cannot be certain, and the words of Jesus himself make this doubtful.

0,"This fiction article stinks of 'que buena para mi position!' (How great is my position on this subject?!) This article is blather.  How about some reality based truth? Instead of the que buena jabber?  Try this: VERITAS. Latin:  truth, reality, honesty, or in Other English words = what we USA Americans care about as fairness as for who comes into our USA, to CONTRIBUTE to our USA, and be our common ground neighbors. This article is heartfelt blather, and misses the point of what an immigrant could and should bring to the subject of their immigrant status and candidacy. If they want to be Americans. Americans require this given the hard work and patriotic efforts of our parents, grandparents, and new friends who are now proud immigrants in the USA!

0,"I'm a white person, born and raised in Canada, from immigrant parents who moved here from Croatia in the 70's. Why do I have to apologize to anybody? What did I do to anyone? Why should I pay for something that happened hundreds of years ago? How many people in Canada can trace their roots that far back in this country? Very few. We are a country of immigrants. So the problem is you are asking an entire country of people to pay for the mistakes of a few who have no connection to them what-so-ever. That will never go over with the majority of people in Canada.

0,"The public schools system in America, including Alaska, has been under siege for over 50 years. The right wing of our country want to decimate the public school system in favor of alternate schools, charter schools, religious, and vouchers. All these alternatives take money from the public school system and the state ends up financing private schools that cater to the rich.

0,"JJ,  You could very well be right.  The way I look at this, the real question everyone should be asking and discussing is why would the Russians prefer Trump over Clinton?  Forget the """"bromance"""" junk and look at policies.  ExxonMobil's CEO being picked as Secretary of State provides a place to begin answering this question in my opinion.

I pointed out that two days was almost certainly not long enough to do a proper investigation. You IMMEDIATELY lept to Burke's defense. I suspect that, as you have shown many, many times before, you believe that Burke can say or do no wrong. You actually lied when you defended his homophobia, which supports my belief.  The name """"Burke"""" is like waving a red flag to you. Mention it, and you must defend him, even when he is obviously in the wrong. When it comes to Burke, you don't care about facts, you just jump in, defending him. That's just plain wrong.  I do not make false accusations.
