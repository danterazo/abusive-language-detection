0,"The party's internal debate is over how to shed the elitist image and expand their appeal beyond minorities to low-educated white folk. Mr. Trump draws on the emotional intensity of the rabble. He's uninformed, his appeal is to the uninformed, and the country endures the consequences. --- For starts, if they want to shed the """"elitist image"""", they need to avoid columnists who trade in slippery terms like """"low-educated white folk"""" (the """"poor"""" will do) and """"the rabble"""" (def. """"ordinary people, especially when regarded as socially inferior or uncouth""""). There's probably more than image involved.

0,"It is so rare and so disconcerting when I agree with the most predictably Liberal leaning of the Globe's stable of political columnists.  Nevertheless Lawrence Martin is right on point with his observation that Brian Mulroney could play an influential role for Canada dealing with the new Trump administration on NAFTA and other issues connected with Canada-US trade and the environment.  Mr. Mulroney is the most widely respected former Canadian PM around the world - with Stephen Harper second - and nowhere more so than in the US and as PM he achieved great progress for Canada on the trade and environmental fronts dealing with the Reagan and the Bush #41 administrations.  So The Chin has the reputation, credibility, personality and negotiating skills plus the long personal relationship with The Donald (their West Palm Beach houses are about a block apart albeit Brian's is much, much smaller) to be useful to PM Trudeau and Canada in an informal ambassadorial/advisory role.  JT, take note.

0,"Whether you agree or disagree with this article, it is refreshing to see that the issues of immigration and culture can now actually be debated. Perhaps we can come to some sort of agreement between the reasonable right and the reasonable left for a solution that we can all live with, before Canada is dragged into its own version of the Trump revolution.

0,"SD, GBA has nothing so this is his common refrain. Astounding, really, to overlook the corruption, collusion, and despicable nature of Trump and his appointees.
"
0,"I just read that 25% of Trump voters think he is unqualified to be president.  Sounds about right to me.  People voted against Clinton and didn't think Trump had a chance.  Now we have to deal with a sociopath in the Oval Office.     Let's stick to science when talking about a scientific issue, shall we?

0,"I'm sorry, but could you please say that in comprehensible English? There's a lot of words there, but with very little discernible meaning.  Trump said it was ok to just go up to women and kiss them or grab them by the """"pu***"""" . This was recorded and is beyond any reasonable dispute.  What is it you are trying to say about """"alternative fact"""" and all that?  Are we supposed to disregard the evidence of our own eyes and ears? Or is this all just some weird plot, by Obama maybe?. He's behind all those protests, isn't he?
"
0,"CO, I believe the democrats see the formula as a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Trump and some votes for Gary Johnson are votes for Trump and when those two groups of voters are combined, Clinton loses if the race is close. But that is a false formula trying to scare folks to vote for Hillary. Most folks who vote Libertarian or Green wouldn't vote any other way regardless of who the democrats or republicans fielded. Those who cross party lines to vote Libertarian or Green might.  I wish I could agree that an Independent candidate would win this year (Sanders might have if he accepted the Green Party offer to lead their ticket.) but it won't occur in my opinion.  Becoming a third party member is a long term strategy for peaceful change.  We will be called a lot of names and other things, but as our numbers grow so will our influence.  Clinton and Trump are the candidates that woke America up to the rot that has set in the political system and there you are correct!  Vote Libertarian!
"
1,"Investigator needed. How much was the Electoral College paid to elect him? Which the Electors were paid? Who did the paying? Hilary may no be 100% honest, but she is no fool. Trump is about as foolish as they come, as well as a racist.
"
0,"Canada is a country that is split within with one element fighting the other  to abandon rather than exploit the country's natural resources. We are also in danger of splitting with our best ally and trading partner as a result. NAFTA is in need of renegotiation but the discussion has been hijacked by anti-Trump Liberal /left/progressives who are more at home with the prospect of a Canada funded by taxes and borrowed money allied to Communist China. If we are indeed a country of 'smart people', we will find our way to an agreement that can serve both country's interests and not be led down the path to a compact with a dictatorship on the other side of the world.

0,"Reese's analysis of the election was, I think, well done.  What is not clear is that in 2018 those House races may become more competitive than he suggests...depending on Trump's popularity...and the issue of Artificial Intelligence  eliminating ever more jobs is a problem that is NOT going away..  The deportation issues are going to be critical....Garcetti in LA just put together legislation that provides for emergency legal counsel for potential deportees that can't afford it or don't know how to get it or both....  I suspect that for religious folks, sanctuary issues and deportation issues will be a important factor and pathetic stories of terminally ill folks who have lost their health care will be a media attention getter, rather wonder if those nuns on that bus might not be really helpful in media attention to these issues....suspect Trump would not go after nuns...but who knows ....he seems capable of almost any thing?

0,"Actually the GOP does not want Trump, the voters do. The GOP was forced to accept the will of the people.
"
0,"Larry, you just keep repeating the same argument. When Trump leads in a poll it's significant. When Hillary leads in a poll it's not.  One of the definitions of """"significant"""" is """"having a particular meaning; indicative of something.""""  Clinton's lead in Pennsylvania, up 6.5 %, is significant. Up 7.3% in Michigan is significant. Up 9% in New Hampshire  is significant. In Virginia up 5% is significant. Up 11% in Colorado is significant.  These swing state polls are lot more indicative of who is going to win the election, than a national popular vote poll, just like they were in 2008 and 2012.  They will bounce around in the next 60 days, but if I were  a candidate, I'd much rather be where Hillary is, than where your boy Trump is.

0,"To compare that alt-right predecessor to Trudeau is downright silly.  Have you forgotten the brilliant pieces your justice reporter Sean Fine filed regarding Harper’s insidious and almost treasonous efforts to destroy our Justice system.  His adoration of billionaire Sheldon Adelson, the Vegas casino operator and high altar Trump supporter. Glad you brought up Trudeau’s pugilist skills.

"
0,"Alternative thesis:  Maybe, rather than most of Americans being white supremacists, they simply did not like Hillary.  White supremacists used to be a term used for skin head Nazis, Aryan Nation, and the Klan - the kind of people who carried torches at Charlottesville - the fringe of the most racist people in America.  The idea that Trump and most of those who voted for him are all white supremacists is either ridiculous or a complete redefinition of the term.  The NFL is not a conspiracy to kill black men.   Black men dominate its ranks because they have the skills and abilities to play the game well.  And they are most dominant in the most athletic positions - cornerback, wide receiver, and running back.  They also dominate basketball and track and field for the same reasons, but nobody is suggesting that this is some sort of conspiracy.  The NFL could be doing more to make the game safer for players, but the foot dragging has much more to do with money than with race.

"
0,"So there were no interactions between Trump campaign representatives and Russian agents until there were. The ever-changing narrative from the Trump side could be innocent omissions or important details linking these contacts to possible collusion. Whatever the case, further exploration by the appropriate congressional committees and the special counsel seem warranted. Opening this can of worms might just make some powerful people squirm.

0,"At what point do the American people have a right to ask if this man, who a minority of our fellow citizens handed power, is emotionally fit to wield it?  At what point is it fair to inquire as to the health of the president’s mind?  At what point is it just to ask about his fundamental fitness to be president, and to demand that his fellow leaders, charged with the proper functioning of the federal government on behalf of all Americans, and not just their hardened, shrunken base, make an inquiry as well?   If Donald Trump begins to blunder this country into war, with the whip of the prosecutor and the shriek of impeachment at his heels, I think it’s incumbent on the American people to decide that the time has long since come.
"
1,"I agree that Trump is amoral but I'm not so sure he's a moron. More and more, I think he's crazy like a fox with his uncanny political survival instincts and his uncanny ability to appeal at every turn to the lowest common denominator in society and then use it to his political advantage. There's a certain kind of genius at work there that is more demonic than moronic, I think, but maybe that's just me.

0,"In listening to the points & counter points by constitutional scholars and attorneys general, one of their key points on why the issue of 'Muslims' was the intent, well-documented courtesy of trump's many rally ramblings during the campaign.  As the 'intent' was to target predominantly Muslim nations (yet skip Saudi Arabia, home to 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers), and as mentioned, trump's senior advisers discussed 'banning Muslims'- it is, by intent and context, a Muslim ban.

0,"Six Quebec Muslims died due to politicians not only refusing to address peoples' concerns, but actually insulting the citizens who have them.  The attacks occurred the day after Justin Trudeau invited all the Muslims refused by Trump to come to Canada. Coincidence? I think not.  There is a lot of official concern about """"alienating"""" Muslim youth who might not feel """"at home"""" if society doesn't respect and  accommodate their extreme beliefs, but none for the non-Muslim youth who feel alienated because their society tells them their concerns don't count. Telling emotionally fragile young people their government doesn't give a hoot about their concerns has consequences, too.

0,"Before Trump won, Abe was on the verge of a peace treaty with Russia, something that has eluded Japan for decades. With that deal sunk, Abe has lost his opportunity to get rid of article 9. The most worrisome thing Abe is up to is in education where his government has been slowly bringing back nationalistic (not patriotic) indoctrination. This is mostly supported by the people as they feel that South Korea and lefty sympathizers in the West will never accept the numerous apologies and financial reparation Japan has openly given. They feel slapped in the face and so feel forced down a different road. Hopefully Trump will convince congress to approve the sale of advanced fighter technology to Japan so Japan will not be forced to continue their stealth fighter program.

Trump’s favorability has grown 9 points, 37 percent to 46 percent, compared to a Morning Consult poll right before the election -- while his unfavorability has dropped 15 points, from 61 percent to 46 percent.  Why?  Because more people aren't buying into the sky is falling predictions made by the pundits.  They're not buying into  """"what if"""" arguments.  This trend will continue.

He was too coward to put on the uniform 50 years ago, like many of the tough flag waving 70 year olds of today.  He'll get a chance to pick his fight.  Just like his warhawk Adviser/Generals, too young for Vietnam and too old to carry a gun in Iraq or Afgan.

The whole point of the matter are the policies governing """"illegal or unregistered immigrants"""" under the Trump administration. In Canada, we try to take into account the big picture. Is the person a functioning, contributing member of society? Do they have dependents? A clean record? How long have they been in the country? Do they work, pay taxes?

I did vote republican but not for Trump and I am not his biggest fan, but you never know he may surprise us.

0,"Agreed on Canada's job is not official opposition.  Deplorable, not so much, as Trump is doing what he promissed in his campaign. Although debatable, people have different view.  If that is what majority in US wanted, one should respect that. Not like Libs with 36% thinking they represent majority an act like it. Two things Trump is loosing some support is messing with Johnson Act Amendment and Dodd-Frank Act. Otherwise, keep  going Mr. Trump, you have half a US behind you. Wheather he will succeed,  is currently in the stars.

Re the pardon -- I did not realize that pre-emptive pardons could be issued, but I found that they can.  The fact is that Hillary has not been charged with anything.

Nobody raises that. Nobody makes a very big deal about that. That's not on the news for five days, six days.  Wat Donald Trump is reflecting is -- and I know the media always discounts this because you don't like to get criticized. But you don't treat us the same way that you treat Democrats. Hillary, Bill, Obama, they get the benefit of the doubt.  And I mean if Trump had said something like I'm going to raise taxes on the middle class, it would be all over the news.

All lives matter.  What is white privilege other than the racist label used to attempt to shame the white race for being white -that's racist propaganda being shoved down the throats of school kids?  And, while i'm thinking about it, since the white race is now becoming the minority does that mean affirmative action now encompasses the Caucasian people?  So while people are all stirred up because of garbage labels quickly provided by mainstream media, think again.

Even though Roof's act was a premeditated, cold-blooded massacre of African-Americans in church by a white supremacist, no one- not even Barrack Obama- was vocal in their condemnation of white supremacism at the time. Yet when protesters and counter-protesters in Virginia got violent at a rally, Trump is excoriated for not IMMEDIATELY denouncing white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the rest of the alt-right.

It doesn't matter what political party a nominee comes from, if they aren't going to uphold the Constitution, I want the Senate to vote them down.

What is far more likely is that his incessant need to settle scores and do whatever it takes to enrich only himself above all others will ensure that all of us will lose except him. Trump supporters think he is in this for them, well I can tell you that the moment he has to make a decision between enriching himself or the people of America he will choose himself every time.

They claim to be victims of the rest of us. The truth is that they vote against their self interest in attempts to punish the rest of us. See Kansas. They are angry about losing the white privilege they claim doesn't exist. They fear merit and equality because they are demotions for them. They are too ignorant to follow the money. They think minorities and the poor get more free stuff from the government than the 1%. They don't know what lobbyist do. So they elected a rich white man that has never done anything in his life to benefit them. The days of getting a family wage job with an 8th grade education are long gone. Robots do those jobs in the 21st century. Robots will eventually replace the Mexican farm workers. White folks refuse to do those jobs anyway.

0,"My point was meant to be that the writer is basically calling Trump a liar and then using logic that an EPA job is the same as as a production job that produces energy to heat homes., etc. Faulty logic used to call him a liar. Even if the extreme where you would try to argue they are of similar value, a reasonable person could see the logic rather than to demonize him for """"Rhetoric rather than """"facts"""". A job that produces energy far outweighs one that does not. The regulator lives off of a percentage of the producer's efforts. Thereby, like a leech, sucking the lifeblood from its host, who eventually turns from healthy to unhealthy as more and more leeches pile on to the feeding trough.

0,"We have a good debate for ranked voting going here.    Ranked voting allows you to 'order' your preference of candidates.    In this case, since it's Hillary supporters who seem most worried about Johnson, you might guess she is preferred over Trump as an alternative choice.  In ranked voting, if a 50% vote is not received by any candidate, the computer tosses out the candidate with the least votes, finds those voters that had them ranked first, applies their second choice, and recounts.  What's good for third parties is that they show their support level in round one because voters do not have to fear they are throwing their vote away for a spoiler.    (Their vote still counts, just using their second choice).  It's a very good way for third parties to show their real support!   They can win primaries, in theory, if they have broad support, say being the second choice on a majority of ballots.  Take a look at ranked voting LFS, it is good choice for third parties.

0,"President Trump’s pursuit of “energy dominance” is likely to amount to a fire sale of oil and gas leases benefiting speculators who pay little up front, hoping to benefit when energy prices rise. Taxpayers would lose and the purported benefits to local communities of greater revenues and more jobs, not unlike the unrealized promises Mr. Trump has made to other communities, are not likely to be realized either. And if national security is the concern, then why not keep our oil and gas in the ground until we need it?  op. cit.

A lot of people were opposed to the arms deal with Saudi Arabia which started with Obama but was often challenged because of the role of Saudi citizens in 9-11 and the role of the Saudi's in funding terrorist groups. Saudi's  have provided vital air fields for the US as well as intelligence in the region. I recall debating people who objected to ties with Saudi Arabia on this board because of its Islamic fundamentalism and connections to funding terrorists. We are pinning our chances for success in this relationship on young (early 30's) Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud. The Prince favors the westernization of the country and a buildup of its military. We will also support him in the war in Yemen against Houthi proxies of Iran. Republicans are chafing a little on this because they feel these developments are happening without congressional input.

It was only a matter of time before those demons became dominant and unleashed the horror.

What they have proposed is what was vetted by the CBO and that non-partisan organization came up with the GOP plan costing 24 Million people their access to healthcare and for many their very lives. If they had prepared a more complete plan which they had seven years to construct then the CBO would have scored that. They didn't because the PPACA is their plan from way back in the Clinton days. The crap burger they submitted was thrown together so hastily and shoved out of the only two committees allowed to debate it so far that the CBO hasn't had time to fully vet the macroeconomic effects but that shoe will be dropping on their heads in the next few days.

Would it be possible to investigate him, bring charges, and take him to court in that case or could he theoretically stop the process every time until his term is up?  My suspicion is that even if that would work what would eventually happen is impeachment and if he's successfully impeached then he's no longer president and then at that point he would no longer have the power to fire the investigators making it possible only then to bring the case.

During most (but not all) of my working life, I had good employer-based medical insurance; but I know what it is to have no insurance, or too little. Members of Congress have what amounts to Medicare. We should be working toward a system in which everyone has Medicare. That system is achievable, but it pits the 'rugged individualism' of conservative economics, which treats health care as a widget, available to those who can afford it, against the 'common good' approach of progressive economics, which treats health care as a human right and is committed to working toward the goal of making that a reality. My original point was and remains that those voters who voted for Trump on pro-life grounds bought a pig in a poke. Two years from now, there will be more abortions, not fewer, as well as an increase in deaths from a variety of causes related to the lack of insurance.

So for them it makes no sense to have all of those people on the move, especially if they are coming to the USA. - A larger problem is that most of the illegal immigrants came to the USA because there was little hope for a sustainable future in some of the 'home countries'.

Had Repub AG's taken it to court, it would've been struck down like DAPA was and they would've become straight up illegal immigrants with no protections.

If Trump was the negotiator he claims to be, the wall would be mentioned so it could be thrown out and replaced with E-verify, something both parties can agree on and signifies real immigration policy progress.

I do agree that the Dems have struggled to promote a coherent message about job growth; but for all we heard from trump, we have yet to see any jobs & infrastructure bills.

From what I can see the closest thing he has said about policy was walking away from """"One China"""" (which he recanted on) and adding a tariff to Chinese imports, which he has no intention of doing but he may think he can use it as a bargaining chip for help with North Korea.  Trump has not proven to be a good negotiator when the other party refuses to be bullied. He needs a new tactic.

There’s more ingenuity to his  hairstyle than any of his rambling pronouncements. His political hero is Vladimir Putin, who has perfected  the “classic, bare-faced whopping lie.”  Trump's meanness and petulance and childlike inadequacies have been on display for more than a year and now he's about to become the President of the US.

1,"Donald Trump is the lead character in Being There, Chauncey the Gardener who likes to watch television.  In this case, FoxNews.  He seems to only watch Fox if he wants his truth.  If he watches any other news program or hears quotes, it is so he can argue with them.  As long as his fellow Fox viewers still like him, he considers himself a success.  As long as the pastors of those viewers endorse him, he feels holy, and sadly, there are such. More sadly, some are Catholic priests and bishops. They are the ones who should know better.  I don't expect it of Trump, who is simply a pathetic character.

0,"I guess I don't understand the lack of impartiality.  Gore took the 2000 election to the Supreme Court and refused to concede until they ruled.  Gore firmly believes the election was stolen and has repeated the claim numerous times.  Hillary said in 2002 that the election was stolen from the Democrats and John Kerry believes that election fraud handed GHW the election in 2004. Democrats have no problem calling an election rigged, refusing to concede an undermine the election process and then further undermining the process later down the road after they concede by claiming some sort of fraud led to their loss.  So Trump says he'll accept the election if he wins and will keep everyone in suspense and the liberals led by the [obviously] liberal coverage of the election from the media and everyone freaks out?!?!  When you apply a different standard to yourself than you do to someone else, it's a contradiction of logic and an obvious double standard.

0,"At the very least, the """"constituionality"""" of DACA has not been fully addressed.  Apparently, lower courts have said Obama exceeded his authority in enacting DACA, but the Supreme Court hasn't put the issued to bed.  So, Sessions, Trump and Huckabee Sanders are lying (once again) when they say they were under legal pressure of some sort doe to a crisis borne of constitutional violation.  They need to quit doing that (lying or exaggerating) to justify their actions.  It completely undermines the credibility of the Office of President.  To me, Trump should just say that he doesn't want DACA to continue as an executive order, and wants Conress to settle it one way or the other, instead of suggesting he HAD to act.  He didn't.  DACA, and abiding by it, was always just a matter of Presidential preference and choice.  I note that historically, Congress has always had the authority to grant citizenship, and special immigration status to both individuals and groups.  So, this is politics.

This past week Trump ordered an end to the Obama-era executive action that shielded around 800,000 young undocumented immigrants – often called Dreamers – from deportation under what’s been known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Look at other of Trump’s recent policy decisions and you see the same arbitrary and unnecessary cruelty. What’s the point of banning transgender people from military service? Of siding in court with a businessman who doesn’t want to sell his services to gay couples? Of weakening the standard for responding to sexual violence in universities? Of banning Syrian refugees and reducing by half the number of refugees admitted to the United States? There is no point, in terms of policy. None of these decisions makes America safer or economically stronger or fairer.

But if he'd entered politics back home, he'd have made the McCarthy Era ten times uglier than it was. So, yes, Trump sounds like Patton in all the wrong ways. He can complete the image by going to a VA hospital and slapping a few PTSD soldiers.

George Bush senior stationed troops in Saudi Arabia which  led directly to the birth of AlQaeda.

The single most qualified Supreme Court Nominee in my or Senator Murkowski's lifetime is put forth and our Senators put McDonnell's agenda ahead of Alaska's. Politics is about compromise and our Senators, in the words of Jesus, have their reward. What little bit Alaska secured from this decision by the President is due to Governor Walker being a better statesman than any member of the Congressional Delegation. The fallback position in politics, if compromise fails, is to just say to hell with it and do the right thing. This isn't Obama, this is McConnell. This is Obama acting like a Republican and maybe doing the right thing at the same time. If you don't like it thank McConnell, and he don't care cause wifey just got a good job with Trump.

They are quite capable of recruiting the blonde and blue-eyed or any other willing body that does not fit the profile. And, the last stat I saw said 78% of terrorist attacks, successful or not were planned and/or committed by American citizens.

With Merkel's position considerably weakened and no appetite to keep bailing out failing economies, Mr. Trump may find more support than we would expect.

Fact: Costs for Obama and family for work and play: 97 million over 8 years.  Fact: Costs for Trump, his wife, child and adult children and inlaws: Over 10million in the first month. Expected annual cost: 183 million per year, not including inflation.  Fact: Trump is enriching himself through his businesses doing business with the US Government and by capitalizing on his position as President.

Trump, with the blessing of those who voted for him, is disrupting the stability of the world.  This will certainly lead to trouble and is why many if not most world leaders fear him and what he is doing.  Essentially the American Empire is about to collapse leaving vacuums to be filled, possibly after military conflicts.  Western Iceland and Northern Russia (but not Russia itself) are not world players.  The US is.  So it is not surprising that these realistic fears are being displaced to possibly innocent ignorant tourists abroad who, in my experience here are vocal Grump supporters..

Why are so many of the Republican Congressmen now retiring, rather than trying to keep their seats? It's a small wave now, with notably more leaving than usual. I think that it could become a tidal wave before next fall's election. His strongest supporters in the party may try to hang in with him. But if that happens, the Party is dead in the """"swing state"""" poll booths. Many of the Republican representatives from those states know that they are likely to lose next year because the Democrats truly have the fire stirred among them - along with millions and millions of the country's voters. Trump is what will keep the Democrats working hard. The U.S.A. is in a mess -  from its political right to its left. If Trump's Presidency continues, possibly all of the """"swing states"""" will swing away from the Republican Party. At this unmatched moment in time, the Republicans are more vulnerable the Democrats.

Trump was essentially elected by angry people who lost their jobs in the rust belt due to American companies  shipping their labour offshore to low wage countries with poor environmental and labour standards.

The democrats have always been the party of control at least as far back as Andrew Jackson. When the South became a better place to do business due to less control, their economy improved. people became less dependent and they went republican. Radical groups? Ever hear of the Weather Underground, the Black Panthers,the FALN? What side has been doing all the rioting over the last eight years under Obama. What party seems to coddle the Mosques that produce our own homegrown terrorists, while hammering little Christian bakeries over gay wedding cakes.

How much do you think it bothers him that Melania pushed his hand away?  Answer:  a lot.  He prides himself on dating and marrying only 10's, and on being in control of the situation.

I want a President who protects the country and makes immigrants follow the laws established to protect this country. If you want to come here legally, welcome.  I still personally don't understand how Trump has embodied this idea of racism and sexism. Yes, he made some bad comments about women. I don't agree with those comments, but the Clintons have done things equally as bad. Besides, it isn't like Trump is going to take women down a notch or two because he is President.  My only concern with Trump is his free mouth that gets away from him. I hope he acts more professional from this point on.

Trump finds it necessary to display this power in a public way.    Maybe Keith would be happy with a May Day parade of US weapons, similar to what Russia and North Korea like to do?    Nothing like letting the world know it's our military power, not our democratic institutions,  that is the source of US power in the era of Trump.  *Honestly, besides tone, I have little problem with Trumps stand with N.

As for the Bank's forecast that Canadian GDP growth will return to full potential 18 months out, at some point the Canadian public and our political leaders might want to quiz the Bank as to why it should be believed. This forecast of closing the """"output gap"""" and getting to full potential in Canada's economy is a staple of Bank forecasts and they have been proved consistently wrong for the past six years. Why should we believe the Bank now, is a reasonable question.

He was born in to money and he has never had anything but glowing praise from his underlings because they knew that if they didn't deal with him kid gloves, he would throw a massive tantrum and fire them on the spot. Now that he is in a position where people are going to ask him questions and are not always going to glorify the donald's every utterance, he is melting down daily.

If you want to change the finding of Roe on when personhood starts, go to Congress, not the Courts, not the states. I am sure the leadership of the movement knows about this option and won’t go there for reasons which I have previously states.

It is not everything -racial attitudes play a major role too - but it is true that workers' wages in the US have stagnated since the 1970s while a vast concentration of wealth at the top has occurred. Similarly, technological change and its effects are real. The spread of """"fake news,"""" the impact of social media, the lack of shared narrative are all important social and political phenomena.

The burden that Trump wants to push on to us is the cost of fixing the massive mess that they have created.  He is obviously still of the belief that the military can do this.  Only neurotics believe that US allied nations have any risk from a conventional military threat. The threat is one that military responses have proven totally inadequate and inappropriate to deal with. In fact, as the past 25 years have proven, they only make things much worse.

0,"Yes, Trudeau obviously has a sneaking admiration for China's """"basic dictatorship"""", an ambition to strike a trade deal with China the way Mulroney did with the US and Harper with the EU, an antipathy to Trump and his policies, and a disdain for our parliament to which he continues to lie, this time having said on several recent occasions that our allies including the US had no problem with the Norsat take over by the Chinese.  Just when it seemed that the one thing this hapless and hopeless government was not mishandling was the NAFTA file with the US, Trudeau seems to be looking for ways to upset and antagonize the US administration.  What a worrisome and sorry spectacle as we approach our 150th birthday as a nation or, as the PM prefers to think of us, as a post nation state.

0,"Yes, why would anyone want to condemn someone such as president Donald Trump? Such an exemplary human being. Someone we can look up to and tell our children to emulate.  A modest, self-made man from humble beginnings who had to work his way up from a tough childhood. A trust-worthy man. An honest man who takes responsibility for his actions. A forthright man with nothing to hide. A gracious, polite man who respects one and all, particularly those less fortunate than him. An intelligent, well read man, grounded in the history and best traditions of this country. A man in command of the facts. A man who is measured and not prone to rash actions. A man who does not lie and keeps his promises. Let's all bow down to Mr. Trump together, Mr. Pilling. We are so lucky to have him as president. And thank God we no longer have to put up with that rascal Obama. I mean, all I need to know is that he is a """"liberal"""" Democrat, that's enough right there to condemn him.

This is a country that values arguments on reality shows, and movies which celebrate dumb characters. That's not a exaggeration - it's the bare truth. Trump was the embodiment of the stirred-up drama most people want to see and the media was happy to provide it. Hillary was painfully dull by comparison. Even her supporters watched and read the stories about Trump to see what distasteful things he said, and that boosted ratings even higher. There was no equality consideration because it might interfere with advertising revenue.

0,"My problem with Mr. Gillam is first, as I understand it, a hedge fund operator.  Hedge fund operators are more likely to be """"money manipulators"""" rather than investors in productive activities.  Selling short is one of their methods of making money.  Another hedge fund operator, George Soros is quoted as saying during the housing crises, """"I am having a wonderful crises, I am making billions.""""  Trump has stated that he will examine the special tax benefits enjoyed  but hedge fund operators.  My second objection is Mr. Gillam's blockage of the Pebble Project.  The Pebble Project should be evaluated on the merits of the project, not political manipulation and dis-information.  I have flown through Lake Clark  Pass many times and probably the erosion along the Tlikakila River alone puts far more mineral """"pollution""""  into Lake Clark and then into Bristol Bay each year than the development of the Pebble Project ever could.

You may have noticed that even among republicans the Donald's support is sagging and it barely been six months.  lol  Are you proud of the fact that you are now aligned with the """"evil empire""""?  Looks like the Donald has hit a new low and only around 200 days.  Oh, thats right this is fake.  According to Gallup's daily tracker of Trump's approval rating, only 34% of Americans approve of the work the president is doing as of Monday. The president has been in office for just over 200 days; this is the lowest his Gallup approval rating has been in that time. Some 61% of voters disapprove — a record high for the poll.

Even centrists are becoming increasingly disgusted with the hypocrisy and privilege they see in the 1%.  But that 1% has done an astounding job of convincing disillusioned voters that the problem is not with their unfettered greed -- it's immigrants taking their jobs and globalization.

That is why he makes political judgments which turn out to be right against the opinions of all his advisers ...

From the latter perspective, looking at the Trudeau and Trump cabinet teams  and their financial track records and reputations and also at the way our lot is piling up massive, unending deficits, spending like drunken sailors and now warring with SB,  I cannot take the Canadian government seriously as sound macro-economic and public finances managers.

As a candidate for president, he is the topic on a range of his dark comments of hate, misogyny, and racism, but the conversation always turns to his playground bully (""""he started it"""") behavior or his security head facing a battery charge for bruising a reporter. In hoops case, the person is the topic.

1,"Indeed, we are still very much in Obama's economy.  The fact is the markets went up strong and steady over 6-7 years under Obama.   They've definitely increased the pace at which they've been going up since Trump's election, likely due to building upon previous gains and the continued hope for/promise of deregulation under Trump and the Republican regime.  Deregulation gins the economy and markets up in the short term, but crashes them in the long term. This has repeatedly been shown to be the case, yet here we go again.

To actually believe that one person can solve all that ails a country. No, for real and enduring change you need to do more than just 'pull a lever' at the ballot box or show up at a rally. The presidential election cycle has become  like a circus, every body shows up then everybody(most) go home until the next circus comes to town four years hence.  Hillary may not be one's ideal choice for president( how rare does that beast appear), but given the alternative left to us, she's the only sane choice. It's nice to pine for Sanders but in many ways he was a chimera, who promised much but would have a very hard time delivering on many of those promises. But he did fit the messiah role nicely.  Sander's supporters ( for a time I was one ) would be wise to remember the old saying """"the perfect is the enemy of the good"""".

0,"I find it interesting that the coverage of this decision approaches the issue as the actions of one man - Donald Trump. Yet Barack Obama's decision to join the Paris Accord was the decision of just one man. Because it is not a treaty with specific goals, or consequences and is really just voluntary, there was no need for the U.S. Congress to debate or approve this decision. As a matter of fact it was specifically designed this way so that the elected representatives in the U.S. Congress would have no input on the decision. Similarly, The Liberals weren't specific about the costs of their climate policy goals during our last election.  This is what is troubling - if the Liberals had said they were going to introduce a carbon tax that would cost in the neighbourhood of $2000 per family by 2022 how many votes might this have cost them? It's what many people find troubling about the arrogance of our political class (of all types).
"
0,"Trump received 304 electoral votes today confirming his victory! Time to put the blame where it belongs on Hillary Clinton and the DNC who colluded to rob Bernie of the nomination. polls showed Sanders did much better against Trump than Clinton. Even though i supported Sanders in the primaries I am glad they cheated him because he lacks the spine to be president after he stood down at the convention even though the fraud was obvious. Trump is a far better choice than either of them.

0,"Fascism and National Socialism were never a left wing ideology, as much as you would like to believe so in your conservative bubble world. Hitler despised Marxism and left-wing ideologies. And leftists despised Hitler. He promoted a hyper-patriotic 'nationalist' movement, based on an ideology of a white supremacy, which always has and always will be a 'right-wing' ideology. And Trump uses similar far-right themes and tactics (e.g. making a white supremacist his chief adviser, stoking hate and fear against a religious minority).  There is no giant 'progressive' conspiracy or rewriting of history, as much as you would like to believe, so you can deny inconvenient truths and facts that don't fit your perspective. You are literally creating your own reality, which makes a 'reasonable' conversation impossible. Try to broaden your mind instead of living in conservative conspiracy theories. Maybe listen or read some international news and see what the rest of the world agrees on as 'facts'.

Fortunately you actually dont get heard and you dont sway the silent majority to your views.  I just hope that Trudeau is careful not to import divisiveness from the US.  He seems to be making a lot of arguments regarding his small business tax changes that amount to trying to stir up class warfare or promoting woman's rights by suggesting that white men in power are defacto unjust and the enemy.  I believe in general, Canadians will not welcome that approach.  We are not perfect but we like getting along and know we have a good thing. Division for the sake of popularity is not positive.

Russia is simply not the military threat that the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations appeared to be (although there were always doubts about the quality of Soviet and Warsaw Pact conventional forces), and there is no other country on the horizon capable of threatening Western Europe or North America, except with nuclear weapons which all the defence spending in the world cannot protect against.

Trump risks millions of lives baiting Jong-un, & also endangers the players, & all who support their cause.  I support the players, who do so much for our communities, and want to raise awareness of the rotten apples whose actions endanger the heroes, the brave and dedicated officers, who risk their lives to make our communities safer.  Trump spurs division based on color, religion, sexual orientation, misogyny & more at both the domestic & global levels. I pray the GOP stops this horror, or Mueller convicts before Trump's damage is irretrievable.  Sadly, it may already be too late. Even if convicted & out of office, Trump has put us at risk of the internal wars now experienced in the Mideast. No doubt Putin's overjoyed. I know I'm heartbroken.

I have personally see white people who do not appear to be racists but have exhibited racists behavior, especially against blacks and Hispanics - the stare and whispers under their breath.  racism cannot be judge by facts alone, but personal feelings.  Obama did not discriminate against whites, he wanted to help the disadvantage, many of whom are black and Hispanics.  but the white people felt that he was discriminating against them, and trumpy with his divisive campaign brought out the racist feelings in these people.  that is why trumpy is not a good person, he caters to feelings rather than policy,
"
0,"Exactly right Steven Forth. Some people, apparently because of Article 9 and the 'Japan Self-Defense Forces' seem to think Japan has a tiny military. In most of the rankings Japan generally is placed seventh in the world for the size of its military.  People also seem to forget that Japan's constitution was imposed on it by the US and that America has, at least until Trump, considered it to be to its advantage to have Japan dependent on the US for its nuclear deterrent.  Trump would also have you believe that the Japanese are getting a free ride. Actually, they are paying about 190 billion yen a year for the 'privilege' of having US forces on their soil.

White House circulated a video publicizing his itinerary that showed a map of Israel that cut out the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and the occupied Golan Heights.  The map angered Israeli officials, and likely also alienated Palestinians for listing Trump’s schedule in both West Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank as under the heading “Israel.”

I have lived in 4 Muslim countries, and understand their siege mentality. The problem is that they don't want to strengthen themselves through education and technology, and prefer to blame foreigners for their woes. Progressive ones like UAE and Qatar show the world that they can have world class cities and companies. So that is the model to be encouraged.

Except for themselves of course. So is it so surprising that Justin marries someone who is in agreement with him. Is it so surprising Justin and his cronies are working feverishly to tax free enterprise and then give the money to their buddies like Bombardier. Centralist government is a prime of the Marxist philosophy so creating a law mandating types of people is normal.  The most dangerous thing about all of this is they don't even know their Marxist's and if faced with this prospect would likely deny it to their graves.

It is a real treat watching this wrecking ball in action. He is a product of our dysfunctional society and political system. So many people fail to see that AND are not MOTIVATED to do something about.  People are constantly underestimating him. I believe that's why the Republicans are scared of what he can do to their political support if he rallies his red hat flag waving deplorables into action.  What is a total utter failure are the democrats who have majority voted for his cabinet picks so far. It looks like they just rolled over breasts up.

But many are so marginalized (low education, no chance for meaningful or adequate employment, etc) that they were willing to grasp at anything that looked like a life line even if so many others knew it was being offered by a snake oil salesman. President Trump is very successfully accomplishing his agenda.  He is quickly dismantling any government oversight that protects the citizens from business while also eliminating or lowering the taxes that immediately impact his family and their holdings.  He, and others of his wealth, know that even if he eventually loses power, it will be extremely difficult to reinstate those measures that protect the lower 95% of the population.  Putin has successfully turned Russia into his personal bank account, why wouldn't other billionaires at least attempt to do the same with the USA?

0,"Trump survives because he calls to the people not the media and elite.  Those groups are trying desperately by any means possible to discredit Trump, but so many Americans are tired on being controlled and brain washed by those with power and personal agenda's.  For example, I finally figured out why the government is keeping interest rates low.  Low interest rates come from the government giving banks all the money they need at no interest.  Where does the government get the money?  It prints it.  They are inflating the money supply.  Inflated money supply means inflation.  Inflation with zero interest robs every Americans savings of many percentage points every year.  Inflation also reduces the value of the federal debt.  So the power elite with media compliance have gone to money creation to rob Americans of their hard earned savings so as to make it easier to pay of the federal debt and allow the government to spend more.  Where was the media in exposing this travesty of trust.

Trump does use a fairly common leadership strategy.   A good manager finds competent subordinates and takes their advice.  So far it appears he's unhappy with many of the early appointments.  But that's not what Trump supporters voted for.   What they are finding out is that President Trump is not so different.  D. Trump  said what he felt would get him elected.   It worked.  Most politicians have figured this out, both parties.   The election season is about winning, not policy.  We can evaluate President Trump by what he has accomplished while serving.

Or how he is determined that citizens will """"be encouraged"""" to sock away money for future health crises? Two things there - it would be optional so those with zero discretionary income will save nothing, and anything a middle income family can set aside won't cover any health crisis.

1,"Trump's hypocrisy in Las Vegas.   Although Trump described the Las Vegas shooter as a """"very sick, demented man,"""" on February 28 he signed a bill that reversed Obama's implementation of a provision in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, which was signed by President Bush in January 2008 in response to the Virginia Tech shooting. That provision required that the Social Security Administration report mentally impaired recipients (there are roughly 75,000) to the national background-check database.  Candidate Trump received $969,138 from the NRA and other gun “rights” organizations, and, in return for their generosity, his action protected the """"right"""" of sick, demented people to buy guns.  It is unclear how many of the 75,000 mentally impaired Social Security recipients are members of the NRA.

In Italy, it is bombastic and neoclassical in form; in Spain, Catholic and religious; in Germany, violent and romantic. It took forms still crazier and more feverishly sinister, if one can imagine, in Romania, whereas under Oswald Mosley, in England, its manner was predictably paternalistic and aristocratic. It is no surprise that the American face of fascism would take on the forms of celebrity television and the casino greeter’s come-on, since that is as much our symbolic scene as nostalgic re-creations of Roman splendors once were Italy’s.""""

As for the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia, it will continue of course. The new FBI Director could influence it to some degree, but doing so would be the makings of a political maelstrom. Many other security agencies are involved in that investigation, Trump can't control them all, and if it exists any damaging information will come out anyway. Then, for attempting to subvert the course of justice, Trump would be vulnerable to impeachment.

0,"One way in which such orders are stopped is by careful litigation against hose parts of the orders that exceed the law.  This kind of litigation is usually handled by groups such as the ACLU, or other non-profits.  These nonprofits need funds to be able to carry their work.  People who support litigation against Trump's orders ought to be donating to groups that work on behalf of immigrant. Another way is through advocacy. People ought to be contacting legislators at every level of government to gear up support for legislation to overturn specific parts of these orders.  To be successful, its necessary to advocate on both sides of the aisle.  For years now, polls have shown that wide margins of Americans advocate reform of out immigration laws.  Some of that reform could happen now, step by step.

Time for a full-scale Revolution to remove all Republicans from all areas of government.

0,"An even more apropos current example to use - Ken Burn's Vietnam War series that is showing on PBS right now. It highlights US presidential, congressional, military hubris; use of false data; lies; breaking global accords to pay homage to a now discredited theory - *falling domino theory* which saw every national or civil war situation as a worldwide communist conspiracy.  Trump's speech can be linked to LBJ's or McNamara's ( who finally admitted he lied) which were complete US propaganda e.g. Tonkin Gulf Incident justifies Rolling Thunder and insertion of US troops to fight; use of body counts that completely ignored actual hearts and minds (btw, 60% of Iranians are under the age of 35 - time and demographics will change Iran.)  This population resembles the Vietnamese nationalists who only wanted south/north unity & independence (French colonialism, Japanese occupation, China threats; US intervention).  If Truman or Eisenhower had listened to the CIA, there would have been no war.

0,"Trump's ACA """"repeal and replace"""" plan would allow persons with a pre-existing medical condition access to health care, but Trump made no mention of cost. Trump addressed cost in two ways, though; tax breaks for persons enrolling in health care, and voluntary health care set-asides. Neither would insure the poor working people who pay no taxes after other deductions, and any voluntary savings for a """"rainy day"""" would be eaten up by two weeks of serious illness. This formula gives very little to middle-income people without employer health care, and absolutely nothing to the nation's 43 million poor, including a lot of children. In other words, Trump's plan would strip those 20 million who got insurance through the ACA, and tens of millions more. As a result of these defections, health insurance would likely double in price in the Trump administration for those left who can afford it.  Americans, you are being royally screwed. And about 42 million of you don't even know it.  NUTS!

I am open to changing those laws but that, in this case, is done at the Federal Level.  As to your denigration of your president you can have your own feelings on the matter.  Trump is not a King, he is legally elected by our Constitutional Republic and it's my recommendation that you just live with it for 4 years and hope you can manage to vote him out of office. Personally I find it refreshing that we have a president that upholds the Constitution instead of trashing it at every opportunity. Liberals hate that though.

The diminishing of the Office of the President to that of the values and decision making of a CEO looking to remove any obstacle to more industrial growth regardless of decimation of the environment and the destruction of the quality of life for future generations for the sake of profit is HOW this administration shouts who it truly represents.  Review the pattern of decisions - all of them enhance the growth of an industry.  +Cupich in a re-reading of Laudato Si Caring for our Common Home -- will find the common ground  he is seeking.

The US can't officially leave until 2019 and can't withdraw until November 2020--just in time for a new president to be elected.  Trump and his advisers just found a way for him to keep his promise to his base without really keeping it, since it will certainly be reversed before it can do too much damage.  Secretary of State Tillerson confirmed as much by immediately telling the world that Trump didn't really mean what he said, calling it """"a policy decision by the president ...

The vote difference in California wouldn't have put Clinton over the top in the popular vote total without the additional 61.5 million votes she received in other states.  California cast 10.3% of the total national popular vote. 31.9% Trump, 62.3% Clinton  In 2012, California cast 10.2% of the national popular vote. About 62% Democratic  California has 10.2% of Electoral College votes.  8 small western states, with less than a third of California’s population, provided Bush with a bigger margin (1,283,076) than California provided Kerry (1,235,659).

1,"I don't think so.   Are you sure you're not being overly simplistic?  The accusation is that Trump cooperated with Russia to affect the American election.  There is no evidence that Clinton did the same.   As you pointed out Clinton had a pretty hostile relationship with Putin - and for myself I'm glad that she did.    (I think he's an ass, an authoritarian, and has used his power for personal wealth and used the wealth to consolidate his power.

That's how well he knew the media--at least the TV medium.  Of course he knew it! He proved himself an able manipulator through his long-running TV show, and that experience gave him knowledge (and knowledge=power) that very few politicians have.  No, the only """"strategy"""" he had was to get down with the people he knew were hurt and angry--and, as we know now, they didn't have to be poor and uneducated. And, to coin two phrases, he said, in effect, """"I hear you"""" and """"I feel your pain.""""  It was so second-nature to the guy that to call it a conscious strategy would be to cheapen it.  Thus, a man who seems so false and fabricated may be, in actuality, one of the most genuine of politicians ever to step before cameras.  Media just went along for the ride.  And whaddya know?

Secondly, when it came time to defend the president’s proposed immigration reforms, the White House decided to give that job to Stephen Miller, who not only did so by fanning the culture war flames, he also sent out clear dog whistles to his white nationalist friends that this administration stands with them.

Trump's thinking is that the US would lose jobs and $Trillions of dollars under the Paris Accord by drawing out the costs of carbon reduction as an ever increasing cost. Technology and innovation are already decreasing carbon at declining costs-- a few years ago no one would predict that petroleum costs would drop and coal and petroleum would be displaced by the market for clean, cheap natural gas. It is the market, technological change and innovation that is leading to fewer coal jobs. The largest source of new jobs in the US and an increasing percentage of new energy production-- over 50%-- is use of ever improving technology using clean wind and solar-- and this is the direction we are heading not backwards.

While in recent history, he appears to shoot from the hip and act impulsively, He has however been promulgating these same views since the 80's and slightly more cogent! Much of what he wildly accuses Obama and Liberals of now, he made these same accusations against the presidency of Ronald Reagan in full page ads in the NYT.  If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. - Sun Tzu  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/08/donald-trump-plays-dumb-dangerous-act

0,"Really? Trump supporters actually believed the Doanld would build a wall?  How dumb is that?  I thought they voted for the Donald mainly because they just didn't like sweet Hillary for some reason.  The wall was perhaps the  dumbest proposal the Doanld had although he had a number of dumb statements.  Sadly he has gone back on areas that he was relatively good on.

But hey they'll surely reinvest the money right here in the USA rather than hoarding or consuming or investing it overseas right?

0,"It's Trump's fault because he didn't have to go into hysterics with his bombastic threats. What Trump actually did was get the UN to sanction one third of North Korean exports. The US can't do anything else to stop North Korea from building workable ICBMs short of an all-out invasion,  which would result in the loss of millions of lives in the Korean Peninsula, including a quarter million Americans there, and probably at least 50 thousand Americans dead, another 100 thousand US casualties. China hasn't launched missiles at us, nor has Russia. I can see no motivation for Korea to do so. But Korea likely thinks it needs a deterrent against US invasion, given that we invaded them before.  No, those threats, loud, boastful, highly visible, and daily, are mainly to distract US citizens from noticing how Trump is being investigated for corruption, how Trump can't get anything done, how Trump has broken every promise, what an incompetent clown Trump is. Our unfunny clown president.
"
0,"Actually.....  It is the Republican Party that have created the Donald Trump phenomena...  Why?  Because the establishment Republicans have promised time after time what they are going to do to dissemble what the Liberals have assembled against the wishes of the Republican voters, and have not only failed to do so, but seem complicit within the wishes of the Democrat Administration.  They should not only lose, but lose badly, as to whatever offices they hold, not because their ideas are bad, which, for the most part, they are not, but because they are not willing to fight for them.  Republicans, especially the establishment Republicans created the supposed monster called Trump because they are weak, and not worthy of respect.  Just as Hillary lies when she states that she represents the poor, women, minorities, etc.,  so does the Republican establishment when it pretends to represent those same categories.  They only represent themselves, and their continuance of power and influence.

I cherish my daydream, some would say a delusion, that having a Jew in the White House might mean we would have someone who could stand up to the Israeli right, and could bend down and truly listen to the sorrows and needs of the Palestinian people. Unlike Trump he actually knows how government works. Unlike Hillary, he voted against NAFTA.  The other alternative is a third term for Bill Clinton, really. Bill is a fine moderate Republican, but hardly a Democrat, unless one compares him to the bizarre right. A President is really a team, and Hillary will undoubtedly bring in Bill's, just like JEB! wanted to extend his war criminal brother's team's time to finish looting the treasury.

"
0,"Bikerman; you do realize that the US has not elected their presidents by popular vote for hundreds of years, right? So, the way the candidates campaign is like this. They target the states that they think that they can win in terms of the number of electoral votes that the state will garner. In Hillarys case, she felt that she could virtually bypass Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin as they had almost always been sure Democratic states. She spent little time in those states. She was playing the same Electoral College math strategy that Trump was. Difference was, he campaigned hard in those states right up until the end. He barely set foot in California as he did not see taking those electoral college votes. Clinton won California by around 4 million votes. That is why they have the electoral college....one state cannot negate the other 49. Why is this important?? Because they both knew that the ELECTORAL COLLEGE vote is all that mattered......and she LOST it. Have a good day.

That's the problem with bullies like Trump, he's hung out all his life with gentle company, they ignored his bullying, he got by with it.  Same with the other GOP candidates during campaign, had one those guys punched Trump in the mouth for bullying or insulting their wives  perhaps we all would have had another better choice in the last election.  Lisa can be assured, she'll have her job next election and perhaps the law will catch up with this bully for his tax evasion and laundering of Russian thieves money.

0,"Mitch McConnell and every Republican leader in the Senate and House whined """"Repeal and Replace"""" for six (6) years.  Trump basically told them that he would sign anything the Republican Senate and House passed that they called """"Repeal and Replace"""" or an even improvement of ACA itself after the House version got to the Senate.  McConnell and Ryan couldn't produce something for Trump to sign.  Trump has now called them on it.  Just like the Democrats have.  Works for me!  Negotiating another failure like Clinton's  or plain chest beating like George Bush did with North Korea are proven failures.  If his 'fire and fury' threat doesn't do it, maybe a thermobaric on Kim might?  Or an EMP on the next missile launch?

Trump is finding out what happens when there are equal branches in a government structure designed to stop an authoritarian from dictating our legal existence.  Unfortunately, the Vatican has no such checks and balances, and Francis is taking too much time figuring out how to get there.  I suspect the biggest conundrum for his potential solutions is the fact his own position is considered 'infallible'.  I get that depends on who holds the papacy, what the topic is, and who is doing the viewing. This is why we could easily revert to a sad form of Western 'Catholic' Civilization is the end all and be all of human civilization.  That particular belief has promoted a whole lot of devastation for non Western cultures who had the misfortune of intersecting with Catholic Europe.  In the 21st century I guess it's supposed to be American Christian civilization.  When does this end, and the Gospel take real effect?

But no, Chin-Chin wants to be on CNN so he spins up this silly publicity stunt and basks in his own mediocrity.

No, Chin-Chin, your silly lawsuit will never make it to SCOTUS (and even if it did, by that time the conservatives will own it 5-4 or better) and you'll never get to be governor.

The court has not taken responses to Kennedy's ruling on the ban of Trump's refugee ban. Kennedy will review written arguments on this which must be filed by Tuesday (tomorrow)-- so technically there is no winner yet. This is one of those unexpected Trump changes of direction. In may, the Trump administration ordered an increase in the number of refugees allowed entry per week from 900 per week to 1500 per week-- now we could be taking in only 500 per week creating a huge backlog of refugees to be processed.

0,"RMC, with due respect, no matter how much you try to dress up your arguments with """"logic"""" and """"data,"""" as I read more of your comments it becomes more obvious they all seem fundamentally based on blind faith in what Republican president George Bush Sr. called """"voodoo economics""""--combined with a presumption that your own personal life experience can be extrapolated to accurately explain the rest of """"reality"""" for everyone else--past, present, and all possible future versions of it.  I know few humans willingly question their most fundamental beliefs about how they think the world does, or at least should, """"work.""""  But I think your blanket explanation--that the world is dynamic, rather than static--for everything you do not know, or don't want to know, is an excuse for not knowing what you do not know, and justifies your belief you already know everything you need to know to justify expressing all of your opinions as facts--e.g. your certainty all will be well during Trump's second year.

0,"Liberals are not interested in reality.  Intelligence officials from the Obama administration have said time and time again that there is no evidence suggesting  Donald Trump did anything wrong with the Russians or that the Russians influenced the presidential election.  The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election. This is a good thing. Intelligence officials found no wrong doing during the Obama administration, and they will find nothing during the Trump administration. When that revelation is revealed, it still won’t matter to Liberals (without or within the Church) because as I have said—Liberals are not interested in reality.

What bishop has really talked about cutting off communion for a politician who supports building the wall across the border or supports the extreme limits on immigration proposed by Trump?

He believes himself to be a great man, deserving of the admiration of the nation - and these numbers, being the most unpopular new president in recorded history, the protests against everything he tries to do - are upsetting him greatly. To the point where he flagrantly lied about how many people attended his inauguration. In fact he EVEN lied about the weather at his inauguration - as if we couldn't all SEE the rain ! This is a man who is desperate for approval and not getting it. But he isn't willing to alter course to gain it, he isn't willing to earn respect. He believes he is right and the world should love him for it - and when the world fails to do so he can't cope with the incongruity.  That was the point I was making. Not that Trump is unpopular: that he cannot stand being unpopular. That is scary.

It is merely pointing out that Trump has been all over the map himself on the Middle East making it difficult for anyone (including apparently his own advisors) to understand what he is going to try and accomplish. Because it is so challenging, it requires a disciplined, focused and restrained approach. None of those qualities have been demonstrated by Trump.

0,"I have an undergrad degree in economics (Keynesian), work in a related field and read up on New Keynesian and Austrian economics.  In today's Keynesian economy, Trump walking away from a trade deal (for instance NAFTA) means eliminating a $60 billion trade deficit with Mexico ($200 per person) and more importantly capital expenditures in the tens to hundreds of billions will likely shift from overseas facilities and equipment to the U.S. Some examples of this have been seen with automotive production with companies such as Ford, GM, Chrysler, Magna, Linamar, Delphi, Borg Warner, Martinrea and others moving from Canada/U.S. to Mexico.  Also on World trade, rather than buying Samsung and LG TVs built in South Korea, there is a better chance that a Canadian manufacturer could be created for Canadian buyers. That would be pretty incredible.  I have no idea how this does not make sense. I can get into a real debate as I think it is educational for the Canadian public.

The US does have interlocking governmental bodies that could act as a rein on the wild Trumpian foolishness, except the house ans senate are both controlled by craven ideologues who think that Trump is on their side (for now) and Trump will be appointing a deciding vote on the Supreme court. So Ms. Wente, just the opposite. Now is the time to be preparing for the worst, to shift our trade as much as possible away from a country that is trying to close its borders, to undertake defence agreements that are not based on the Americans helping anyone but themselves, and to generally disengage from the US as much as possible, economically, politically, militarily, diplomatically.

Tim Kaine made the mistake of interrupting too much, which didn't go over well, but on matters of substance he seemed more in command of the facts. Unfortunately for Pence, the portrait of Trump he presented bore no resemblance to the actual Trump, and for anyone who values truth in this election (which, as in war, seems to be the first casualty) that's a problem. Time will tell, but as Steve Schmidt said yesterday, this was probably the least consequential VP debate in a generation since all the interest is being generated at the top of the ticket, specifically with Donald Trump's daily antics.

We can't know what effort he might be making to moderate or control Trump in private; but in public he has become one of Trump's chief enablers: lying for him, allowing Trump to lie to him, fawning over him. The presidency of Donald Trump is a horrendous tragedy for the United States and for the world; the tragedy will not end when he leaves office. Trump's successor must be a person of sober judgment and unquestioned integrity. Pence's nauseatingly obsequious attitude toward Trump calls both his judgement and his integrity into question.

Trump has chosen to raise the constitutional issue of establishing religion by consistently saying his intent is to ban Muslims.  The radical right and Judge Trenga are choosing to ignore this.

0,"It's like you people don't read. Trump's son-in-law, daughter, and some of his grand kids are Jewish. He's been given awards from a Jewish organizations. He went to the Wailing Wall in Israel, wore a kippah, and prayed. Netanyahu called him a great friend of Israel.  Because you make things up and are uneducated on the subject does not make your lies facts or reality. They are the antithesis of truth.

0,"What eventually became the """"dossier"""" was triggered by a right-wing group doing broad oppo research on all the GOP candidates. But, when Trump became the nominee, the Democrats picked up this nascient research and hugely expanded its scope. Dems hid behind their attorneys, so they could plausibly deny/obfuscate knowledge of these efforts to the public and even the Senate Intelligence Committee.  The kicker is that while Dems have been trying to pin Russian collusion on Trump - it was these attorneys (with likely knowledge and participation of high-level Dems) who were ACTUALLY colluded with Russians in preparing the dossier.  I bet we see Mueller indict Manafort on Monday for money laundering or something. But I wonder if we'll later see indictments of high-level Democrats for their involvement in this - and lying about it to Congressional investigators. Pretty scummy stuff.  Then the question becomes ... will anyone care about this Dem treachery?

0,"When I saw the story's headline, I, too, thought Trump had finally -- and forcefully -- denounced the rise in anti-Semitism after blowing it off in two previous public occasions (replying to a reporter's question about anti-Semitism with remarks about his huge electoral victory ... bizarre). However, when I saw the POTUS reading and referring to prepared remarks it seemed so contrived, so disingenuous, so un-Trump-like. I do commend him (and his advisers) for staying on script for a change.

0,"Meanwhile, he's asking for $999 mil to start his wall. Heo no! He said Mexico is going to pay for it so he got to go get it from Mexico. I ain't gonna pay for a Trump Wall so he can use it for his ego! If this request goes through, we'll really need to get all those who vote to pass this item in the budget out of office. This is what we get after Trumpcare? I haven't seem his budget proposal but it would be quite interesting. I want to see how he's going to increase military spending, build his wall ($999 mil for 64 miles only), get Trumpcare in place, cut corporate taxes, cut income taxes. No money coming in but huge increase in spending doesn't work for my budget. I'm thinking he'll borrow from the Russian banks. They have a lot of cash. His guy used to run the Bank of Cyprus that is used by Russians to launder money. Son in law has the ins with the VEB Bank chairman. The reason why he has so many Russian connections if becoming clear. He borrow from them.

And when you're tired of them, you just hang them out, one by one, and let them twist in the wind.  Nobody will help them.  The others just watch, sweating blood.  Trump understands this.  He knows McConnell has a brain and isn't somebody to mess with.  That's why his wife got a cabinet post.  Ryan, though, is naive to the point of stupidity.  He runs to clean Trump's privy and Trump just despises him for it.  He's marked for early betrayal.  De Vos, Carson, Perry--more fools who'll go down when Herr Trump has no more use for them.

I've been saying for some time that one of these bubbles will pop(not sure which one it will be), then comes the domino effect.  The sad part is Trump will be the one to solely take the blame, when in all honesty the problem goes back further.  Clinton pushed off his bubble burst, as did bush, as did Obama.  No one solved anything just kicked the can further down and borrowed themselves into oblivion.  Guess that's what happens when you rely on lawyers and oilman to run your country.

0,"Here's the difference, though.  Trump didn't merely express skepticism; he disparaged the intelligence and integrity of the officers and agencies that serve the country and the president.  And he did it without having seen their report.  And he did it publicly, in 140 character bursts. On the question of WMDs: it should be remembered that there was a significant minority in the intelligence community that dissented from the findings that led to the war.  Some of that dissenting information was readily available to members of congress who didn't see it because they didn't read past the summary report; some of it was suppressed by Dick Cheney. This is an article from the Foreign Policy Journal, The Lies that Led to the Iraq War and the Persistent Myth of ‘Intelligence Failure’: http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2012/09/08/the-lies-that-led-to-the-iraq-war-and-the-persistent-myth-of-intelligence-failure/

While you may disagree with his comments, with the recent election and upcoming inauguration it is totally acceptable that a comparison between personalities of a great former governor of our State and the soon to be POTUS be made.  Trump has spent his career hawking his own name while """"saying anything to close a deal"""".

Moreover, fully three-quarters of the report isn't about the alleged intrusion, it's about IT best practices to protect against intrusions. Finally, the claim that the US election was influenced by Russian activity is not made by the authors of the report (FBI and Homeland Security) but by the Obama administration.  Now don't get me wrong. Of course Russia is cyber-hacking targets of interest. Every technologically advanced country is doing so. They're all well behind the USA in their capabilities, but they're doing their best. And what better target than foreign political parties in the country of interest. They're bound to have valuable information, but without the government's resources to protect it.

0,"I find it interesting that neither the editorial writer nor those commenting have referenced the difference between the Federal Government and state governments.  The U.S. Constitution is one of limited powers. It does not provide general police powers. This is not true of state government constitutions as those entities have general police powers and are free to re-distribute income to the extent supported by the voting public.  The Trump budget actually honors the Catholic principle of subsidiarity as it restricts itself to areas that states and individuals are less capable such as national defense and infrastructure; and leaves to the states and we the people care for the poor and disabled.  Unless you are donating 10% of your income as I am, you have the means to help those who cannot help themselves and step into the breach.  If every American donated 10% of his income for the poor, we would have no need for any Federal program and would be a richer country as a result.

0,"J. P. K: Having worked as a teacher, I can`t believe it might not happen- I believe it`s already like that!  Too often, students are taught in our culture that their entitlements are paramount, that the demands of the imperious self may always be satisfied before any other consideration. The Trump phenomenon is merely a single brilliant embodiment of a cultural tendency  created over decades. About getting old and being glad you won`t have to struggle with it,  well, I think it`s a rule that everybody is born into difficult times - the chief difficulty lying in finding the way to become a decent human being. The various religious and social institutions, however, that should be there to facilitate that search, are always compromised and challenged to greater or lesser degrees in each generation, though the personal responsibility to make the effort remains. Being a catholic I believe in the Communion of Saints - in trying to be a power for good, we have help and we can all help!

The insurance companies are giant casinos staffed with well-paid actuaries who make sure the house always wins; I see no good in moving those bookies to the corrupt, inefficient US government.  What I'm hearing from Trump is the promotion of competition between the """"casinos,"""" which is a step in the right direction, although I have to believe that there is another solution between insurance companies and government-run health care.  Part of the problem is the high cost of health care itself.  It's a wealthy industry from what I see in my city.  No one seems to mention that.

Basically, these executive leadership certificates are basically a money making certificate mill just so the name """"Naval"""" is attached.  Grew up in North Carolina and worked in Alabama and Georgia.  Only a white male with such credentials would get appointed by Emperor Trump and confirmed by the Senate to head FEMA.  If you are a minority or a woman, to be Chief of FEMA, there is ZERO CHANCE of being Chief of FEMA with Brock Long's credentials.

It's funny how character, morals, the things a person says, the views a person has seemed to matter so much just a short time ago! It seems it didn't take much to jettison these ideals from the minds of religious and conservative voters. Racist things Trump has said are easy to find: “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes… Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else…Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that’s guy’s lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks,” “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists…

As we all (should) know, Article II of the Constitution gives ALL executive power is given to the President of the United States. Consequently, President Trump had every right to tell Comey to go light with General Flynn and he had every right to fire him for incompetence. The FBI is NOT independent! Comey worked for Trump.

One tribe appears convinced that vast majority of people who picked Trump now regret their 'grave mistake'.   I suspect this is a further confirmation that the echo-chamber safe-zone news bubbles is still alive.  My theory :  people who voted for Trump fall between two ends of a spectrum.  (a) nationalists rejecting any globalist agenda that distributes wealth to poorer nations until every last pothole in every local street is fixed. (b) those who see Trump as toxic chemotherapy for a cancer they blame on the elites manning the gateways of US culture : press, Hollywood,  pop-divas, deep-state.

0,"Totally unfair. Hindsight is NOT always a fair way to evaluate decisions in the past.  As I understand Obama's 2013 decision, given a determination to prevent further use of chemical weapons in Syria, he had a choice between doing what Trump did yesterday, and accepting the Russian offer to remove chemical weapons from Assad. He chose to trust the Russians, and that decision appears to have worked well, at least for nerve agents like saran, until now. Strangely, despite Trump's blaming Obama, Trump's  action can be seen as a continuation of the Obama policy (the Russians failed to keep their promise, so time to try the alternative option), and indeed one might argue that Obama's action has increased the legitimacy of Trump's action in the eyes of the world (the US tried restraint and trusted Russia; that failed so not is the time to bomb).

He simply reacts to whatever immediate stimulus that he encounters which distracts him from his normally constant state of dwelling upon his own self-imagined greatness. HIs lizard brain controls all his actions. When Trump acts it's simply autonomous. He's well know for agreeing with the last person that gives him any kind of input. It's what he is. Vacuous.

0,"When Trump talked 'tweaking' earlier I knew in my guts this is false. He didn't bash NAFTA in campaign as evil no. 1 and only to tweak it. His agenda is now clear: 1. Cut off Mexico free trade to stop U.S. corporations outsourcing there. Any new agreement is worthless. 2. Crack open Canadian industries that's not in NAFTA. This is TPP but only on Canada. And thus permit U.S. corporations to take over 95% of Canadian business from the current 75%. A side benefit for Trump is, from the dominant control of Canadian business, the European trade deal (CETA) is meaningless. He kills two birds with one stone. 3. Trump will demand measures to prevent Canada from doing freer trade deals with China.  I.e. Kick out Mexico, take over Canada. As ex-U.S. SoS Henry Kissinger once said, being enemy of the U.S. is dangerous, being friend is fatal.  Trump will threaten leaving NAFTA every single day. That's because he has decided to leave. Negotiation is what to replace it. My answer: the above.

0,"Larry Asher - Therein lies the problem. You are assuming that everything your favorite media outlet reports about President Trump (or anyone else) is """"fact-based"""" and trustworthy, when in fact, if you listened to a variety of media sources rather than just the ones you like, you'd learn that there's a great deal more to some stories (not just about President Trump) that your preferred, supposedly trustworthy media leaves out in an attempt to slant public opinion in their favor.  Yes, journalists should be balanced, but I used to be one and I can tell you that most of them were incapable of separating their personal opinion from their coverage of the news. Personally, I would record events so I could go back and mine the stuff that I didn't think was important when I was taking notes, so I saw the bias even in myself ... I just simply tried not to act upon it. Unfortunately, most of my colleagues were more self-assured in their own intelligence and the rightness of their opinions.

0,"Coming from someone that moved to Toronto more than a year ago from my birth city of Vancouver, all this talk by the government of a foreign investor tax is going to have the opposite effect.  They just gave foreign investors time to rush in and buy due to fear of a tax, and just like Vancouver, home prices will now increase exponentially until the law is in place, before stabilizing.  Wiser leadership would have kept this plan a secret until the day it was implemented. This tax became inevitable for Toronto the day Vancouver passed its 15% tax, thus shifting foreign investment demand to Toronto (compounded by Trump winning the US election).

Throw the book at this young woman to make an example, but let environmental criminals like Exxon's CEO Rex Tillerson your Secretary of State. Exxon has refused to pay billions in damages to the people of Alaska for environmental damage the Exxon Valdez spill caused in 1989.

The Russia Report was written by a known, respected British intelligence operative and was included as part of a national intelligence briefing for Trump and for the President. Buzzfeed published the 35 page report with massive disclaimers indicating it was unverified but from a credible source. The U.S. intelligence community obviously agreed so included it. The breakthrough was in identifying who wrote the report. CNN did not report the Russia Report as factual. Fake news is NOT unverified reports waiting for confirmation, fake news is stories that are MADE UP in order to further an agenda, i.e. a hoax or false story intended to mislead. To say that fake news is the same as legitimate news awaiting more reporting is simply untrue and unhelpful. You are actually the one spreading fake news, GBA.

If you look at some of those people that you're talking about, they're outside of the country. They're having a lot of their product made outside."""" They are """"Grand standers"""". . Why the sudden change? It couldn't be because these executives don't support Trump's position on Charlottesville? Oh no, it's because they do not take their job seriously.

I think an important instance is the lie Trump insisted that Donald Jr. tell regarding the now infamous meeting with Russians during the campaign.  Jr., Jared and their lawyers had agreed that their best bet was to pull the proverbial band-aid -- that is, to tell the truth quickly and candidly, knowing that it would hurt, but also knowing that if they didn't tell the truth, it would hurt more if/when the truth eventually emerged. This is sound strategy legally and as crisis management. But Trump Sr. was having none of it. He insisted that Jr., Jared and their attorneys lie about the meeting: who attended, what they discussed, etc. Then he sent his own team of liars -- Sanders, Sekulow, et alia out to perpetuate the lies; and of course they all got caught. Yesterday, Sanders, in another pathetic performance, tried to continue spinning the lies.

We have a relationship with their government such that vetting of immigrants is possible. And their government does not sponsor terrorism.

Not Canada if Trudeau is smart.  Third, he use and permitted the Pentagon to use Japan and South Korea as launch pad for the invasion of  North Korea, a project much dear to the Pentagon and war monger leadership. He permitted continued stationing of THAAD missiles aimed to neutralize China nuke ICBMs. These two vassals of the American empire will get hit first in a war and will get wiped out.

0,"You have to consider the 'why' (a stronger more independent military) and not just the 'what' (increased military spending). Canada is too economically tied to America, and Europe (Trump's enemy) is an obvious way to diversify our portfolio of economic partners. Mind you, The Monroe Doctrine is still in effect so we can expect an escalating series of destabilizing actions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine This also makes interesting reading in light of The Trump Empire. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/canada-should-make-itself-at-home/article4187823/ Many of the assertions made in this article have failed to materialize, especially the premature death declaration of the of The Monroe Doctrine.

0,"You wrote, """"Right wing radio and TV dominate the airwaves across America.""""  It is a strange, sick, alternate reality.    I hope that you are right about Americans coming to their senses.  But, I think we are being behaviorally and conceptually programmed (brainwashed).  Media memes are taking on their own reality.  Robert Mercer, a billionaire shaper and handler of Trump, is a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and thought manipulation.  I don't think Nascar Bubba's can find their way out of this one or even want to.  Just give 'em guns and big boy pants, and they are happy.    They don't want to stop believing the propaganda and are not aware of the danger.  Mercer's abilities apply to creating paradigm shifts in thinking that are being adopted by even educated, more circumspect people.   A lot Americans are being fooled, now.  We really do need a factual, impeachment inquiry to regain our collective sanity.

0,"What were the chances ever that any of us free market purveyors would be siding with a union boss.? Trump could have done a bit of homework or had better consultants but instead got lazy and went for optics. Ironically the people that Trump purported to support with his agenda , could be in the long hurt by his lack of business acumen. Even a regular working man union leader can't escape,the wrath of a Trump twitter storm. This poor guy calls out Trump for his misinformation and what happens , he gets death threats. Sad.

Now we know and it isn't the fault of FEMA but natural events have overwhelmed the ability of the authorities to deal with them. Puerto Rico has the problem that it is not a US State despite its efforts to become one and the State of Florida not only contains Trump's own estate but a sizeable Cuban diaspora that is solidly Republican and anti-Cuba. Florida also had millions of people without power and is easier to reach than Puerto Rico. We should not forget either that Texas was hammered earlier - US authorities simply have too much devastation to handle all at one time.

Well before victories for Brexit and Trump seemed possible, Bannon declared there was a “global tea party movement” and praised European far-right parties like Great Britain’s UKIP and France’s National Front. Bannon also suggested that a racist element in far-right parties “all gets kind of washed out,” that the West was facing a “crisis of capitalism” after losing its “Judeo-Christian foundation,” and he blasted “crony capitalists” in Washington for failing to prosecute bank executives over the financial crisis.""""

They failed to recognize that their candidate is a hated person by many who viewed her as a corrupt/entitled politician. They failed to listen to the middle class and virtually left out the white middle class who have watched their pay and buying power go stagnate or negative over the last two decades. Trump on the other hand acknowledged their frustration and appealed to them in a populist way sort of how Sarah Half-Term did in Alaska. Now the man must deliver what he campaigned on. Only time will tell if he can deliver.

Trump is the prime example of why we have """"checks and balances"""" in our constitution. So don`t fret 777.

It doesn’t matter that they have been in the country for decades and have teenage children, born in the United States and therefore U.S. citizens.  Deporting all or a large percentage of undocumented immigrants would cause the United States economy to collapse. There is already a large deficit of workers needed to perform the tasks that most of these undocumented immigrants perform. Large scale deportations will only exasperate the problem.

He followed Brannon's lead in denouncing Goldman innthe campaign-- Cohn was the greedy banker in Brannon's movie.

Thanks so much for the tip.  As to being a failed businessman, most business people I know would consider themselves great successes if they built an empire of over 500 business units and tens of thousands of employees in dozens of countries and were worth at least 6 billion bucks.

It was CONgress, esp. the GOP, that forced O to back-off from Assad. And Russia and Syria are now attacking our planes/troops/allies.

If you learn something about NK, then you will understand that from infancy all of its populace is efficiently brainwashed to believe that the US is a demon which will rape, torture, and kill all NKs unless NK destroys the US and its allies such as Japan first.  For the NKs the brutal Japanese occupation and the US napalming of civilians c 1950 - 53 happened just yesterday and the Japanese/US alliance is poised at NK's border ready to resume its war on NK at any moment.  Kim has developed WMDs, most notably ICBMs, satellites, hydrogen bombs, and biological weapons which could easily """"annihilate"""" the US and its allies as Kim threatens.  Kim is a criminally-insane monster who despises the US and its allies.  Polarization is bad, but it will not annihilate just now 300 million people. Kim's WMDs could and will unless he is stopped.

0,">>  “… since NK has made some of their ICBMs road mobile, the possibility of striking them with HPM is contingent on finding them first before launch,”  Concur. It is essential to learn what kind of and how many electronic and optical signatures these vehicles emit during the pre launch position/prep period.  Which means proactive full spectrum sigint and optical data collection by our overhead systems (air breathing and low earth orbit) is essential. Indeed that may be one of the unannounced purposes of these peninsula overflights.  >>  “ It appears that they are still technically in development or would already be installed.”  Not necessarily. Boeing Phantom Works and our armed forces both have good reason to encourage the DPRK to believe IOC has not yet been achieved when in fact these systems may have already been covertly added to our air ordnance inventory, ready for upload onto delivery a/c.

0,"Trump could have saved himself a lot of wasted legal hassling if he did what some of his advisors told him to do-- use Obama's list of 7 countries which train and indoctrinate terrorists to vet and exclude potential terrorists no matter where they came. This way a British, French, Belgium, Arab or Dutch citizen who has travelled to Libya one or more times will be vetted as a potential terrorist. So the Manchester bomber who was a British citizen, but who travelled to Libya would be vetted. Even if the Supreme Court drops the temporary stay obtained by Hawaii and other states, Trump's approach will be challenged until it is """"fixed""""-- remember, the Marines and Seals were ready to sue to get in Muslims who helped them until the temporary stay. In fact, once Trump's stay goes into effect unless it is fixed, there will be more challenges and more wasted legal proceedings.

What American public got for that ? Nothing, many holes in Syria and possibly thousands ISIS fighters ready to come to US and Europe and do some damage. Lets assume that Trump is more corrupt and he will take 20% of say $10B construction budget. He will make $2B. What American public end up with? Airports, bridges, roads, new hospitals and schools.

The first idea being that no country after suffering the devastation of the war would even think about waging one on that scale again.  The second idea has equal prosperity being the linchpin that would support the first idea.  If everyone was happy and doing well, there would be no need for armed conflict again over resources.  In hindsight very idealistic.  Human greed can never be underestimated, and Trump is the penultimate expression of that greed.  We are willing to cut out all that is important to our country to insure that the rich stay rich, and the economic gap continues to widen.  There is nothing Trump can do or say that will matter, he will continue to have support, that is how deluded the public is.

They the establishment (D, R and media) all turned on him like a rabid dog.

0,"Yes-- the President could even direct the FBI to stop the investigation. But the President may not stop Congressional investigations, although Congress does not have the legal tools the FBI has to carry out a criminal investigation. But the President can be impeached depending on why he is firing the FBI Director or appointing another FBI Director. This power to impeach the President is granted by the constitution. This is why Trump has given several reasons to justify his firing of Comey. This is because while he has the right to fire him or even direct him to stop the investigation, he can be impeached by Congress if Congress finds that the termination constitutes obstruction and finds that obstruction under the circumstances is one of the grounds for impeachment:treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. The President has tremendous power but cannot commit crimes that Congress finds are impeachable under the constitution.

But the price of an Epipen, which has been the focus of a life and death  struggle over spiraling costs dropped from $600 ( pack of 2 @ $1200) to $100 at CVS Drugs for a generic equivalent. ($10 if you use CVS discount coupons) .  That didn't get much news coverage did it.  Trump also called for lower HIV drugs to save lives  but  LGBT leaders called him a homophobe.

Trump appears to be a puppet, with Steve Bannon, the neo-Nazi counselor-to-the-president, and Putin, the homicidal maniac in Moscow, alternating in the role of puppet master. Trump's ignorance and arrogance, together with his immaturity and emotional instability come together in a reckless, dangerous man.

Thus the right took over State Legislatures, Governors of 30 States, the House, the Senate, the executive, and will appoint the next Justice to the Supreme Court.

Also remember that Obama was a junior senator from Illinois that had not completed 1 term.  He had not served in the US House or in any other capacity on the national stage.  This is what made it so sadly laughable when the Democrats were complaining about Sarah Palin's lack of experience.  As far as Trump is concerned, I do not think most of his overseas holdings came about in the last 8 years.

Pretty sure elite in this case means an equation of power, mostly backed by great wealth.    Not a terrible choice, at least you're likely to find some level of proffesional success among the wealthy.  Donald Trump is clearly alligned with that catagory of 'elite'.  As a young person it was clearly the Republican party with it's emphasis on business and leadership that was tagged as elitiist.    Would Jonah today accept the most populist of organization, (in theory), labor unions deciding the strategies and function of management of a successful business?  Populism likes to say it's the word of the people, but it can also mean the extreme repression of a minority opinion, or the advance of extreme popular bias.

0,"Spadaro is very adept at articulating the positive vision of mercy from Pope Francis; unfortunately he is less so when summarizing the views of those he sees in distinction from this vision. It was the same weakness in the Civilta article from the summer. I find he conflates & compresses diverse views & presents them in a flat, un-nuanced manner that I suspect many of those who hold the views being criticized would object to. For instance, in his talk he opposes Francis with the """"neo-crusaders"""" who posit an """"axis of evil."""" I'm sure Michael Gerson, the architect of the image, & himself both an admitted fan of Francis & ardent critic of Trump, would be surprised to hear himself accused of believing that someone is beyond mercy or redemption. Spadaro also mentioned that Francis is careful to avoid being identified with liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Spadaro's facile engagement with some of his interlocutors.

He certainly didn't inherit a recession, as Obama had. Anyone with an IQ over 50 (it appears most have IQs below 50) knows that the economy is affected by far more than who is president. Q4 was higher, it seems, based on two things: 1) elimination of the uncertainty of who would be president 2) unfounded optimism that Trump actually knew something that no one else did.

That's the very definition of bigotry -- and if it's the basis for law or for policy, it's unconstitutional. Of course, that's why Giuliani was tasked with designing a Muslim ban that might not look like one. Too bad for Trump that Giuliani couldn't resist bragging about it. I'm also asserting that Trump is lying when he says his executive order is not a Muslim ban. However, I'll give you credit for admitting -- belatedly, reluctantly and probably inadvertently, -- that it is in fact a Muslim ban.

If the UNHCR refers refugees to the U.S., they then face scrutiny from federal intelligence and security agency officers.  1)Their names, biographical info and fingerprints are run through federal terrorism and criminal databases. 2) Meanwhile, the refugees are interviewed by Department of Homeland Security officials. 3) If approved they then go through a medical screening, a match with sponsor agencies, culture orientation classes and then, one more security clearance. 4) Syrian refugees must also clear one more additional hurdle.

Trump needed to convince China that it was in their best interest to go along with the sanctions. He did that by convincing China that he would attack N. Korea. How he convinced them was, he ordered all American out of N. Korea by the end of August. Then, if the sanctions don't work, you can count on the might of the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, to bomb the hell out of N. Korea, using the Americans' new huge non-nuclear bomb that does just as much damage without the radioactivity. No one wants a war but you can never go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to either go all the way or else walk away from the negotiation. Walking away is not an option here, so I suggest that if you live in South Korea, you should consider starting to move out of the major cities.

State and local taxes. Trump wants to take this deduction away because he says that only high-income people deduct this. But in the state like Hawaii it's an important deduction for the middle class as well.  Payroll taxes. We should deduct all of it and not just a portion.  And I would start paying taxes at the minimum wage rate rather than at $15,000. More like over $20,000 a year.

These candidates dont want to fix it. They want to exploit it! I demand to see my vote before and after an election. Our votes should be audited by an independent agency so these goons cant touch it.

If insurance companies can't exclude those with preexisting conditions, but customers aren't required to purchase insurance, they won't until they are sick. The system falls apart.

Maybe he could give everyone who purchases insurance the full tax credit regardless of income. This might work out very well.

0,"Trump's career in politics has its roots in the racist drivel that came to be known as 'birtherism.' His speech announcing his candidacy was notable for its racism. Racism permeated his campaign. As he occasionally paid lip service to other constituencies in order to """"expand his base"""", the base itself remained, and remains, steadfastly racist. Steve Bannon's chief function in the campaign and in the White House is to serve a guarantor to the base that Trump will and does remain faithful to the racist roots of his campaign. His refusal to attend the NAACP Convention is not only because he's a coward (although he is certainly that); it's also and especially because he doesn't want the base to think he's softening. The base -- the ones who will support him even if he shoots someone on Fifth Ave., the 'Deplorables' -- the base remains racist: always was, always will be. Trump too.

0,"If you work W-2 for a living, payroll taxes are taken by your employer right off the top. Why would you take an illegal job if you can work legally and probably earn a higher wage, which means that you pay those payroll taxes (DACA recipients can work legally)? Is it possible that not all Dreamers pay income taxes? Sure. As to whether immigrants provide innovative solutions that can result in the the establishment of businesses, foreign-born inventors played especially large roles in cutting-edge fields like semiconductor device manufacturing (87 percent), pharmaceutical drugs or drug compounds (79 percent), and optics (77 percent) as measured by approved patent applications. Whether those exact percentages are currently correct or not is certainly debateable (my numbers are from 2015),but that immigrants provide a greater degree of innovation than native-borns is settled. Article II, Section 3 of the US Constitution supports both Obama's and Trump's immigration executive actions.

0,"I beg to differ on this.  Although the subject is touchy and the headline is basically correct, the press asked the question and they're used to Republicans being silent and trying to be diplomatic about it.  However, diplomacy and silence are not traits associated with Donald Trump so, rather than allow them to put out fake news about phone calls to survivors of our fallen military people, he told them what he did and then put out a fact that they wouldn't report on.  I'm sure General Kelly has told him he wasn't called by the President, when his son died, which probably upset President Trump a lot, so he brought it up.  I'm sure President Obama was NEVER asked a question like this, but the morally bankrupt media will lower the standards to do most anything to President Trump.  Liberals get their panties in a wad and you never know what they'll do.  However, I can assure them, if they do things to President Trump, they may not get the desired result.

I, for one, would not be surprised if he has, in fact, engaged in some other rather """"strange"""" sexual activities.  If that is the case and if the Russians do have video recordings showing it, this would compromise the soon to be President of the United States.  Trump will be a President unlike any President we've ever had.  It will be a task for anyone....Congress, the Supreme Court, the media, or the people of the U.S. to hold him accountable.

But the media and the left has been even more knee-jerk in their response.  First of all, it was only a temporary ban.  But most importantly, these are 7 failed states, and are hot beds of extremism.  And to assert that we have had zero incidents from immigrants from those contries is ludicrous.  Just last November a Somali ran his car into a crowd of students a Ohio State, then jumped out and started hacking at the survivors with a machete.

Since your last """"fact"""" is not a fact - """"his refusal to pay contractors when work is completed"""", you illustrate the dangers of wrapping yourself in the supposed mantle of a """"clinical practice of assessing and diagnosing a clinical condition"""" and opining.  The phrase """"Trump's entire focus is solely himself, his concern for others is based entirely on their use and benefit to him"""" describes a typical businessman's transactional focus and is common to successful businessmen, as well leaders like Putin.  You have a personal opinion and are entitled to it.

0,"Sadly, even relatively conservative US universities like Notre Dame in relatively conservative parts of the US like Indiana are now increasingly under the control of a 21st century version of fascism whereby the radical left on campus is dedicated to opposing freedom of speech and even association when the speakers and/or groups involved happen to be on the right side of the political divide.  Banning and boycotting speakers, getting professors and deans fired even for sometimes accidental or misinterpreted politically incorrect (i.e. not slavishly lefty wing) utterances, engaging in 21st century book burning in the form of banning posters and face book users/accounts and, other manifestations of this intolerance seem to be reaching new heights of absurdity.  Is a 1984 style Newspeak ensuring we lose our ability to voice and eventually to think about notions alien to left wing cant next?  Getting Trump banned from speaking and walking out on VP Spence is the latest such disgrace.
"
1,"Rubbish. He was elected by idjits who spent their time informing themselves on Breitbart and fake news stories written by scam artists in Bulgaria.

0,"I still see this as the political horse trading which was best exemplified when LBJ was in power in the Congress.  Neither of this agreement's participants are important or powerful enough to fit either Faustian role.  Calling on Faust is just another way for advocates to demonize their opponents.  Yawn!  As far as Trump's 'policies', he is a chameleon;  he changes his 'policies' (such as they are) more often than most people change their socks!   Hillary has four to five sound bytes, Bernie has about three.  Trump tosses new ones out on Twitter almost hourly and sees what happens.   Some segment of the voting herd likes some of them and he repeats that byte for them.  If they bomb, he is like the nasal  GPS lady """"Recalculating!"""".
"
0,"Nate, you summarized the Reuters article as saying. """"[The ODNI] has chosen to not endorse the idea that Russia """"hacked"""" the election."""" But that is not what the article says. The ODNI does not dispute the evidence of Russian hacking (they agree with it), but they are uncertain as to the motive.  I think Russia's motivations were revealed by the information they chose to leak, the candidate who suffered the damages, and the pro-Russian statements Trump made throughout the election, including his request to the Russians to do more hacking.

0,"It is interesting on this site to notice that many of the people who said all those Bundy nuts were guilty of treason and were going to spend the rest of their lives in jail are the same ones making the same predictions about President Trump.

As prognosticators of politically motivated criminal verdicts our local liberals are not even as good as an astrologer or a palm reader!

Trump and his unstable administration have ALL Americans in harms way.  This includes our national security and our economy.

You consider our buddies Saudi Arabia better why?  Does the US manipulate more elections?  Who has killed more people in the last 10 years, Nethanyahu or Putin?  Obama or Putin?

Over the past few decades, we have watched as a once great party has moved in this direction and has increasingly become more pathological.

"
0,"While we still don't know if Trump actively colluded with Russia, we do know that Trump screwed up and put the safety and security of our nation in jeopardy. He was warned about Flynn by Obama days after the election and did nothing and later by Yates and still did nothing for weeks until the whole scandal became public. Trump also lied. He knew of Flynn's contacts with Russia but then went on for months telling us """"neither he or anyone in his administration had anything to do with Russia."""" There is no explaining that away. To put Flynn in charge of National Security with the knowledge of his Russian ties is either a deliberate treasonous act or complete gross incompetence - neither of which can be tolerated.

It was hardly even mentioned by the press, because the healthcare conglomerates, hedge funds, investors, and political hacks that feed of private healthcare, all banded together and killed the very idea.

0,"I would be very interested in your definition of an 'elitist' because from my perspective Mr. Trump certainly would be an elitist.  My impression is that he has power and authority derived from his wealth and media profile and he seems to want to favour other people who have significant amounts of money based on his cabinet selection.  Certainly he is not a member of the established political elite, but the business elite may well be more dangerous.

Sending your press secretary to rush out and harangue the media about the size of the crowd at your inauguration is scarcely the way a president should act.

It is crucial this happen so that State level legislatures can not continue the gerrymandering after the 2000 census.  What could also happen is Trump not only starts his own media network, but also starts his own political party.  That would throw the GOP into the dust bin of history, but open the way for Dems to elect a majority capable of actually governing the country.

0,"Hale is right about the fact that Trump will probably lose.  As to the civil war in the Church, sadly there is a desire among conservative Catholics and the hierarchy for renewed religious power for the Church - but in moral/cultural affairs, not economic justice.  Trump's real beef with the system is the electoral college, which heavily favors Democrats at the moment.  The GOP represents the power of the wealthy few over the many - so of course they need to continually delegitimize any movement by the many.  Trump believes a variant of what Nixon believed, that if he says it, it has to be the truth.  Sadly, many believe him.

Because they've got several mandates for judgements totaling 6 figures against Towards Responsible Development.   Black Diamond City Council Member Janie Edelman was/is the Vice President of her husband's state non-profit TRD - she's voting on issues concerning the master development for over 18 months with what appears to be a serious conflict of interest.

But its findings are not substantially different from those of similar polls taken by other polling agencies over the years. And they make sense. Most Canadians, at least the educated ones, understand that new taxpayers are needed to fund the pensions of the growing population of seniors, and pay for extra health care,  etc. As seniors retire, they not only need to be replaced in the workforce, but they place a higher demand on these resources. It's not rocket science. As for the second part about souring on the United States, I see no disagreement. I understand that many people worldwide have decided to avoid traveling to the States. It's the Trump effect.

First what proof do you have that Trump believes NK could be wiped out (even what proof that he actually wants that) and 2nd expand on what the 'adult' reactions the past 8 years have done to limit Kim's actions and the NK build up of nuclear weapons? Every politician US/Korea/Japan knows that the massive NK arms build up on its border is its MAD protection. This huge build up (typical socialist/marxist mentality, guns guns guns guns and FO butter for its people) is there to wipe out Seoul should there be any attack on NK. China and most sane socialists/marxists know that all pressure will fade out if NK would just relent on its massive suppression of its own people and focus on the butter and not just the guns guns. Trump is not an interfering internationalist and would prefer to stay focused on the US and let the rest of the world stew in its own juices, the truth.

He ridicules any and all those who are not like him[handicapped, people of other races, cultures, women]. He can and will CREATE situations to suit himself.  Trump sees himself as the CEO of the United States, not as a Public Servant.  He is NOT used to working as equal partners with Congress, nor with members of the Supreme Court.  He still acts like he's on his old TV show """"The Apprentice"""" [where he can fire anybody he wishes and whenever].  Trump comments are a source of embarrassment to the American people.  Other world leaders just look at him and roll their eyes.  He certainly doesn't have the leader of North Korea shaking in his boots, either.

I'd be hard-pressed to say that Trump has been a good husband. 3) Obama seems to have had an actual role in raising his kids, who seem fairly mature and pleasant (no, I'm sure they're not perfect).  Compare them to Donald's 2 sons that are as big of liars as he is. 4) If you think Joe Scarborough is a liberal, you are sadly mistaken.  Held a rating in the mid-90% range from the American Conservative Union while in Congress, and voted for Bill Clinton's impeachment.  He was critical of Obama on his show when it was warranted.  On top of that, he has been a lifelong conservative and Republican, unlike the guy you seem to worship.  I guess you forgot that Trump was a big Clinton donor once upon a time.

We have had presidents who were soft spoken, gentlemanly and diplomatic. Now look at our modern politicians.

What Mr. Keavy was advocating was the right to freedom of conscience which is the constitutional right of every citizen to decide FOR THEMSELVES how she/he will live her/his life. Christians have the right to speak about what they believe and non-Christians have the right to disregard what they say about their beliefs. Likewise for the Christian when the non-believer shares her/his beliefs. The rub that Keavy was referring to is the problem, and it's a serious one for Christians, of them believing that their fellow citizens can be forced to live according to the tenants of the Christian faith. Christianity is the majority religion in the U.S. and Christian politicians use their public office to force non-religious Americans to live according to that religion. See, for example, Trump's discriminatory exemption of women's reproductive health from mandatory coverage by insurance.  Much trouble's ahead.

Hence the clamor for change and hope which was either not understood or simply ignored by the political leaders.  Therefore the voters who opted for change no matter what put Donald Trump in the driver seat.   Second, we the people individually or communally have not been seriously involved with our government.  We just let things go. So there we are.  Good or bad, we deserve the kind of leaders and government we have.  If we have to blame someone or something, blame ourselves.

1,"Justin """"Get the f--k out of my way"""" Trudeau is a fine one to talk about leaving domestic politics at home when dealing with the US. The Liberal Party's unprecedented partisanship in the 2016 election campaign, even to having Gerald Butts tweet about Trump's imaginary links to the KKK, were intended to solidify the Liberal base. This was most obvious in a letter that went out to Liberal supporters that could have been written by the DNC. The idiocy of such antics when there was a possibility that Trump could win should have been obvious, but then Trudeau never was the sharpest tool in the shed. If these NAFTA negotiations were of such earthshaking importance why didn't Trudeau refuse to settle until after they were over? Anything he might have believed we could lose from delaying a settlement in court costs and so forth, would be miniscule compared to what we would lose if NAFTA negotiations go very badly. But for Trudeau, catering to jihadists will always be priority #1.

0,"As President Trump has noted, the world has a real problem: NK, which will dominate the entirety of his trip, not just the first half, as this article claims.  NK reiterated yesterday that it has no interest whatsoever in diplomacy;  SK IC believes it likely that NK will test a missile and a bomb during Trump's visit.  That kind of provocation could conceivably spark a response, especially if it is a H-bomb in the Pacific and/or it kills people, as it might well do if it is a missile test.  With 3 carrier battle groups close to NK and F-35s now stationed on Kadena, the US is preparing to use the military option.  Essentially, NK and the US are on the brink.  NK refuses to give up its WMDs;  the US insists that they must. The PRC does not want to press sufficiently to force NK's denuclearization and Russia claims that sanctions will never lead to NK's denuclearization.  Thus, the options are:  a) horrific war in Korea;  b) even worse possibility of NK thermonuclear ICBMs hitting the US.

They won't be the last thanks to the shameless incompetence of Wynne, Trudeau, Butts, Notley, and Horgan - a veritable dream team of #progressive ignorance. Petronas will end up building a pipeline to the Gulf or planned Oregon Coast LNG plants while Canada gives up a $38 billion investment. Although it seems unlikely today given the string of legislative failures by Trump, if the US ever gets around to comprehensive tax reform - Canadian businesses will move south overnight, Canada's tax professionals are already advising as much. Canada's best and brightest won't be far behind with personal taxation bordering confiscation after Morneau gets his way.

He joins an unnamed Republican donor working with Clinton ally David Brock who has made a similar offer of $5 million."""" But the point I was making is that both sides have no problem with pushing the envelope to and maybe even breaking the law.  No way am I going to defend what Trump asked for regardless of why or how he meant it.  But I also disagree with the view that Russia is our enemy that Clinton forwards (Romney said this in the last campaign also.)  Geopolitics is far bigger than campaign swipes and what both say may come back to haunt them.  The benefit I have of being a Libertarian is I can bounce back and forth and play this stupid game against whichever side I think makes the dumbest statement.

In true Trump fashion he jumped on a political landmine with both feet and attacked a gold star mother rather than simply admitted that he misspoke.  This was a golden presidential moment but Trump had to go and screw it up by making it political (Obama never did this) and verbally attacking a grieving mother.

Most tribes are close to cult like, since what they have been shaped to believe overrides any independent exploratory thoughts or actions. And so today the DNC and RNC are wringing their hands, stepping back and trying to figure out if there is anyway to salvage the Presidency of the most powerful Nation on Earth. Contested conventions?, some last second entry - Biden? How?, when the only cards they have to play are the Two of Socialism, the Six of Denial and the Joker.

The fact that he cannot tear himself away from fighting with everyone, including former beauty pageant contestants, long enough to articulate a position on policy is a very, very bad sign.

Trump, like him or not, was elected to be president. He is only doing things he said he would do, and for which he was made the nominee of the Republican party, and won the election. It may well be that Bush disagrees with Trump...heck, I don't agree with everything Trump says, and, I suspect a lot of the people who elected him feel the same way.  Were Bush to have been vocal about Obama's improper actions, ever taken him to task for policy decisions he made, it might not seem so bad that he is doing this to Trump. He kept his mouth shut, giving his silent imprimatur to Obama's actions. Since he's making waves about Trump but, not Obama, he must have agreed with Obama.

I am glad it has been made into a series, glad other people, especially women, will see it.  I am not at all sure that younger women know how hard it has been to create the changes that have occurred in making room for women in the law, in careers that used to be closed to them, in pay.

All of the whining reminds me of a losing basketball team that blames the refs for their loss.  When it is that close, the loss is a result of what the team did, not the refs.  The Democrats lost this election not because of  the electoral college, but because they chose a candidate even more flawed than Trump (hard to do).

0,"Donald Trump has been right about many things, but more than anything else, he has been right about the fact that the media have become the enemy of the citizenry.  The media is the enabler of the corrupt elitist politics that has created a """"populist"""" backlash.  If I can't stand self-serving politicians who value the optics of preening for the cameras and sucking up to the UN more than the quality of life if their own citizens,  does that make me a populist? If so, then count me a populist.  If I hate the fact that under Stephen Harper Canada had not increased government spending for 6 years in absolute dollars (about 280 billion each year, give or take), and Trudeau has blown open the bank in just 2 years, and is about to raise my taxes to pay for his silly agenda, does that make me a populist? Then I am one.  Where is the media discussion of these issues?

The KKK is using the Republican presidential frontrunner as an outreach tool, said Rachel Pendergraft, the national membership coordinator for the Knights Party.  Scott Shepherd, a former Grand Dragon in the Ku Klux Klan—who once called ex-KKK leader David Duke a good friend—sees strong similarities between Duke’s campaigns for public office and Trump’s GOP Presidential bid.

This is magnified and repeated by the media so much, that what should be a fringe opinion has become fact in peoples' minds.  The 'freak out' this election is much more magnified than it should be.  Labels - When he is promoting policies which have a goal of revitalizing inner cities, it is difficult to reconcile that with """"racist"""".   Maybe it was just empty talk, we will see.  """"Women-hating"""", no he definitely likes women.  Now does he objectify them, and treat individual women differently based on appearance, yep 100%.  He also treats men differently based on appearance which is at least consistent.  As for his Putin comments, people are reading way, way too much into them.

One way we know that besides reading the decision, is that 1) the injunction was imposed and blocked DAPA, and 2) the DACA program was not blocked and it was still going on which Is why Trump had to order that it be stopped while he and Congress decide how to end it. (Before the two year life Obama gave it). The article you have does not make it clear what happened. It does not say DACA was blocked, but it says the expansion of DACA was blocked and that expansion was really part of DAPA-- a much bigger program. The fact that DACA was going on is also the reason that AG's from 10 states were seeking legal action to stop it.

That Trump is not merely defending the right to speak a message of hate. I think I mentioned earlier/elsewhere that my problem isn't with Trump's message but how he delivered it.  That the way he presented his message was distinctly engineered to not alienate the part of his base that includes the KKK, Neo-nazis, and alt-right white supremacists.  If we only look at the way Duke et. al have responded to his statements it is clear that there was significant wiggle room for Trump to continue being supported.

It got us nowhere because, really, the GOP doesn't give a dang about the unborn any more than it does about the born. It cares about power, money, and status. They were in charge for years and didn't do much at all to help women in distress financially so that they could choose to give birth.

Republicans have used racism to get the Southern white vote ever since Lee Atwater invented the Southern Strategy that got Ronnie Reagan elected.  Trump has made that racism blatant.  The RNC propaganda organs for years have been accusing Democrats of what they know themselves to be guilty of - cheating the poor, appealing to bigots, running up the deficit to enrich the few who are already rich beyond imagining (like Trump, or Romney).

Trump is making the world a very, very, very dangerous place for American citizens.

THAT is the assessment of over 60% of the Americans Trump purports to """"lead"""".

Voter turnout was low, because a lot of disappointed Bernie fans stayed home.

They did not, which Comey subsequently half-admitted while condemning Hillary of """"irresponsibility"""". Then, Comey did a repeat right before the election. Again, the emails contained no smoking gun, but the damage was done.  If Bernie had dropped out earlier and campaigned vigorously for Hillary and strong voter turnout, we would not be where we are, with a loose cannon crashing around on the top gun deck, awash in heavy seas.  Low voter turnout was the main factor, and it will be the main factor in 2018 and 2020.

Trump does not have the authority to order an investigation of Flynn (which he implicitly did by not ordering an end to the investigation when it was in his power to do so) and attempt to influence the results of that investigation. This would be like a police chief ordering detectives to investigate a crime but also ordering them not to identify the criminal as X.  The president's power to pardon and direct the justice department is ultimately held in check by the voting public and their decision to vote for or against the president in the future. The president has the power to end prosecution and criminal investigations. However, when he decides to do so he must use those powers so his actions are subject to democratic review. From a legal perspective, that is what Trump should have done.

0,"Donnie, accuracy and balance in assessing candidate's political views has never been one of your skill sets. In your haste to paint Franz, a political moderate and owner of a small farm and timber land as an """"extremist environmentalist"""" you didn't mention Steve McLaughlin's controversial support for the Hammonds, the ranchers arrested and imprisoned for arson of Federal Lands.  I don't feel McLaughlin is as extremist as he's been painted by some environmental groups, but there are aspects of his position on public lands that are troubling in a candidate for public lands commissioner.  He is a member of COWS, a group which advocates turning over Federal public lands to the states, which has often led to sales to private concerns.. In his favor, he withdrew his support from the Bundy-led group when they seized the Malheur Refuge and has retreated from supporting Donald Trump. Still, after assessing both candidate's positions, Franz is the safer choice for public lands commissioner..

Even the mixed-up and partial Supreme Court of """"our"""" state knew to give the incorrect phrase """"amply fund"""" special consideration, and relented to the legislature to decide those things. No mystery why the Union's response quotes it wrong. Can't blame them, but, don't join them in their self-serving strategy. Will things come to a head, as more deal with the challenge of impasse by those who currently have no consequence? Or, is this just more bluster? What would happen if the legislature deals with it as Reagan did with the air traffic coordinators? And, Trump has made clear his method on the same group!

0,"Clinton will be the nominee and Sanders will not...end of issue. Sanders' supporters need to give up their grade-schooler temper tantrum and support Clinton. The race was fair and square. The race rules were know by both candidates well before the voting occurred. The votes didn't work out for Sanders. Its time for the Sanders people to accept that and move on.  Back in 2000, a bunch of Democrats cast votes for a guy name Ralph Nader. Nader never had a chance in hell of winning and just took votes away from Al Gore. The result was the worst president in American history: the reprehensible and stunningly  incompetent George W. Bush.  Trump has the potential to be worse than Bush.  It doesn't matter if you support Hillary or simply want to keep Trump out of office, all Democratic voters need to rally around the Democratic nominee...and that nominee is Hillary Clinton.

Putin positively hated her when she was a journalist based in Moscow. I think (not sure) she played a role as foreign adviser when the Ukrainian constitution was been written.

These same negative comments also flooded the Globe's website following Russia's annexation of Crimea, in response to Globe editorials critical of the Putin regime's military involvement in Ukraine. The most likely explanation is that these comments are being posted by Russian trolls, as part of the Kremlin's campaign to undermine Western liberal democracies. A quick google search reveals a large number of articles (dating back to at least 2014) reporting on Russian trolling of the comment sections of the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, and other liberal news outlets.

The Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council and all of those who are associated (and paid) don't care about fish for the future; they care about $ for their own pockets today. The expansions of both the Pacific Remote Islands and Papahanaumokuakea received wide-spread support, had sound science rationale, and wide public engagement. Plus, both Monuments were reduced in size after this public engagement (with PRI, the longline fishing industry got a nice chunk of conservation area removed because they battled so vigorously) with Papahanaumokuakea, the original proposal was scaled back to ensure that local fishers could continue fishing around weather buoys. Everyone in Hawaii should be outraged by Wespac's use of federal funds over the last 6 months to lobby the Trump administration to remove these protections for their own profit. Shameful.

There's the fear that Trump will make abortions illegal (he  just wants to leave it up to each state).  The fear of prosecution of Muslims, LGBTQI people and other minorities because they think he's LITERALLY HITLER..  Then there's the repeal of Affordable Care Act and free birth control.

Not going to happen due to the simple fact that coal plants are much more expensive to build and operate than natural gas plants, and the US will have cheap """"fracked"""" gas for the foreseeable future.  So what should we do for our """"coal mining refugees"""" in Appalachia is coal if not coming back?  My suggestion is to stimulate new alternative-energy technology manufacturers to locate manufacturing where the coal jobs were lost.  One stimulus could be in the form of capital gains tax reduction for investment in these areas, perhaps zero capital gains tax for investments held for at least 10 years.  Another stimulus could be to increase the amount that a business can deduct for wages and salaries  beyond the actual out-of-pocket cost for wages that exceeded the minimum wage.  This approach should unify interests of the displaced coal miners, environmentalists, and business interests far better than bringing back coal plants.

And the Russians need good relations with the U.S. It's time to recalibrate and reset, thinking ahead to the natural and  national interests of both countries. Perhaps there is a reason why D.T. plans on building up the U.S. Navy, and it's not likely for anti-submarine detection in the North Atlantic nor in the Med.

They were warned in veiled homilies about life issues, and at the end of Mass to keep the sanctity of life at the forefront of their minds before voting. They didn't like Trump, they were appalled at his words....but they were in fear for their soul. They were following the main teaching of their Church as they saw it. I tried my best to discuss other issues with them, and to share Pope Francis's words on other important Catholic teaching, but I fear we have become the Republican Catholic Church of America...at least in my community.

0,"To describe Trump as """"pro-life"""" is to make a mockery of the term and reduce it to meaninglessness.

As a controversial war, there were those like McCain who chose to go fight in it; and there were those like Clinton whose conscience led them to oppose it.  I deeply respect both points of view. But then there were those  low lifes-- and I knew many of them in college-- who were """"patriots"""" who supported the war but wanted to let others go fight it. Trump went to a military academy where he performed well in his military duties as well as athletics, perfect preparation for a future officer in Viet Nam.  But he used four years of business school deferments, followed by a """"bone spur"""" (chuckle) to avoid service.

Today Mr. Holder is working for a law firm that represents many of the large banks.  However he isn't the only one.

Indeed, the Republicans have had her investigated ever since the '90s and found nothing major.

If I'm a short seller, doesn't matter the industry, but let's pick Apple the largest, wealthiest company in the world. Sixty percent of Apple's income comes offfshore.

Could it be because their own scientist/whistleblower Dr. Thompson has admitted to falsifying and trashing data in their 2004 study that links the MMR to Autism? Could it be that when the Vaccine Act of 1986 was passed giving vaccine manufacturers immunity from prosecution, parents of vaccine injured children were left to grovel in the special kangaroo court that takes an average of 8 years to go through? The same court has awarded almost $4billion  for injuries ranging from Seizure Disorders, Death and yes, even Autism-Hannah Poling to name just one.

With 22 million more Americans left uninsured as a result of the GOP Senate's version of their health care bill, and profoundly reducing Medicaid benefits in the years ahead, this legislation looks terminal. A health care bill in which participation is not universal, important funding to support it is relinquished by excluding tax revenue and where states can change the terms of insurance with little substantiation will leave many without coverage. Those who would most suffer are those needing extended care such as the elderly. This GOP replacement of Obamacare, a fundamental campaign promise of President Trump, still appears to be a cure lacking a disease.

0,"Thomas perhaps it is best to leave the science of climate change to the scientists rather than the politicians Humans have never been responsible for climate change .  The earth has seen most of its really significant change before humankind appeared.  Tell me how humankind could change the real factors of climate change as elucidated by Milankovitch in his description of the earth , sun and the solar system as the explanation for glacial cycles. Science -  please explain how 1 (one) measley CO2 molecule can change the temperature of the 2500 mostly larger and more efficent greenhouse gas molecules- atmospheric molecules around it.  This is CO2 at 400 ppm in our atmosphere, one in 2500. Physically impossible. Trump may very well do the honest thing  and put scientists rather than diverse politicians back in charge of NOAA and NASA who seem to be """"cooking the stats""""  by adjusting historical temperature  data cooler. A review by bonafide scients is welcome.

When asked if they were afraid of the Nazis before they came to power, their unanimous answer was, """"No, because Adolph Hitler was just a clown who could never get into power, and, even if he did, he wouldn't last a month.""""  People of left, right, and center have all underestimated Trump.  He certainly isn't as crafty or disciplined as Hitler, but we underestimate him and the damage he can do at our peril.

In addition I am now sitting at an additional 10% cash equivalent - adding to it at a rate of 2.5% every time the S&P adds another 100 points. I plan to re-invest 25% of that cash every time the S&P registers a 10% drop.  Every Republican President since Lincoln has seen at least one recession begin while in Office.

0,"Re Trump giving away money.  Nobody knows for sure, since he hides his taxes. But researchers/fact checkers did delve extensively into the subject and found that he had given no money to his own foundation since around 2007.  They also found that many charities to whom he had pledged money as a sponsor for their various dinners and balls, never received it.  They learned that the veterans' groups who had been promised money from his foundation (when he decided to not face Megyn Kelly at another debate and held his own media event, asking people to donate to the Foundation who would send the contributions to veteran's groups)  had received nothing - UNTIL lthe Washington Post exposed that fact.  Then some donations were sent, but apparently not as much as the money that was raised.  His son's foundation has donated to the causes it espouses, but Trump's own foundation (now closed, trying to avoid an investigation by NY state) used money to pay for personal items (eg a portrait of Trump)

0,"Excellent column. The fact that the US was the model of racism that the Nazis admired and based their own Nuremberg Laws on is an historical fact that needs full recognition. The US was the international model of racism for well over a century. This is important because racism continues to be the single most important and fundamental defining quality of US politics today. The election of Trump broke down solidly along racial lines. Since 1964, the Republicans have played the """"race card"""" to win elections. In 1968, Nixon brought in the """"southern strategy"""" which the GOP has used since. The """"war on drugs"""", which resulted in the mass incarceration of black men, was deliberately designed to do just that. If Jim Crow was fading away, the US right had to find new ways to keep African Americans from voting and to devastate their communities. Today, gerrymandering and voter suppression laws serve the same function. Racism remains at the core of US politics.

Just as significant as the news conference, and surely related to it, was Vice Admiral Robert Harward's decision to refuse the appointment to be National Security Adviser. He was unable to secure from Trump the assurance that he, Harward, would be able to appoint the staff he wanted. I infer that he wanted to remove the neo-Nazi Bannon from the Principals' Committee and to dissolve the 'Strategic Initiatives Group' Bannon has formed within the NSC to advance his fascist agenda. Bannon has effected a (so-far) bloodless coup within the NSC. I think the puppet president is powerless to stop him, even if he wanted to.

I SUSPECT he is, of a sort, but believes his being president is worth the cost to the American people, as he is so awesome, that the thought of depriving the US people of his leadership is the greater evil.  If he needs to stoke acts of hate, it is merely the cost of his being their great leader.  He will, no doubt, like every problem, solve this, too.  He is awesome, right? This is what makes Trump so dangerous.  His vast over-estimation of himself, and vast under-estimation of the damage he is doing, in achieving, and maintaining, his presidency. Can he be reigned in, before the damn breaks?  So far, it looks very unlikely. America has always loved crisis, real or imagined.

The Western values many Westerners are proud of and many non Westerners love are the liberal democratic ideals developed after WW II by liberal and humanist philosophers. In a world in which developing nations like China, India, Russia, Brazil, Turkey etc can increasingly compete with the West in many areas, the West has no appeal without these ideals.

I kept mentioning it during the campaign season that Hillary is a terrible choice but still better than Trump because Trump would jump on political landmines with two feet which Hillary had the statescraft experience to dance around them.  Off the top of my head here's a list of idiotic choices which Trump often double-downed on when he could have pivoted, if not outright avoided, if he had any experience in public office: -Charlottesville -Tillerson's diplomacy with North Korea -Joe Arpaio -Court losses on various Executive Orders, most notably four of the five versions of the travel ban. -Everything Flynn -Calling the intelligence agency as """"on a witch hunt"""" I expect I could probable drub up a half dozen other questionable decision Trump made that Hillary would have avoided but these are just the ones off the top of my head and his first year in office isn't even over.

0,"John. One of the things i have learned in life is when a lot of people blindly start telling me how bad something is, What it really means is that I have to investigate and find out for myself.  Too many people will repeat what they heard, over and over, without bothering to investigate if it is actually true or not. The more that people whine and cry about Trump, the more i want to find out what is triggering their whining.  You ever go into a preschool or room with a lot of babies ?  If just one starts crying, pretty soon the entire room will be crying if you don't get the first one to stop. Its a chain reaction, and the only trigger necessary was that the first one was crying. Most of the others will feed off of that emotion and start crying too. . Its the same thing we are observing with the media. They are ignoring all of the accomplishments, and simply repeating and repeating what others are saying. """"i feel bad"""".. """"OH ? I FEEL BAD TOO !"""", """"Yea, I feel HORRIBLE !!"""" Trumps Fault!

"
0,"I thought she had already released her 2015 tax return.  Here is my guess on why Trump won't release his tax return.  He is on the record as saying his overall amount of wealth depends on his view of it that day.  My assumption is that he views it as huge when it makes him look good and very small where it costs him extra taxes.  A lot of Trump's value is based on judgment calls of the value of the real estate.  It would also be bad for his future business if he is on record saying the value of X real estate is 100K when he hopes to sell it for 300K.  It also releases the information of how much he actually paid for the parcel of land and gives more information about the value.  That would not be helpful in future negotiations.  This isn't a nefarious reason, but he should just come clean on why he won't release it.

But he need to fill his Trump International Hotel in DC, and he has to be there.  But at this point Trump, if impeached, could not be convicted, the votes aren't there.

When he senses that his staff is trying to get him to do one thing, Trump defiantly does the opposite; otherwise he bathes in the commodified reactionary grievance of partisan media, looking for stories about himself.  It takes days for his oafish and overmatched handlers to coax him into even a coded and qualified criticism of neo-Nazis, and an instant for him to willfully undo it.  Of course he brings more vigor to the latter than the former; he doesn’t really understand why he had to do the first thing, but he innately and deeply understands why he did the second.

The Rust belt is old, white and went racist enough for Trump to win or so it appears. Demographic change is a slower process than the radicalization of racist Americans.

Tillerson was reassuring NATO that Trump would not walk the United States away from the NATO alliance. Mattis was reassuring Iraq that Trump would not start a war to steal their oil.

An iPhone costs 1 yuan to build in China in 2016.  3.  China devalues the yuan to be worth 2 yuan for 1 US dollar in 2017.  4.  Apple now pays 50 cents ( .5 yuan) to China for an iPhone to be built.  5.  Caterpillar backhoe cost 1 US dollar to build, thus 1 yuan in 2016.  6.  In 2017, the backhoe now costs 2 yuan.  7.

Fast forward to today :  Trump said it best on how every four years the democrats tell blacks they have their backs---then disappear until the next election.  Trump repeatedly mentioned how he planned to fix the inner cities---the greatest death trap for minorities. Under Obama black unemployment rose and thousands died in the inner cities across America . If Trump keeps his promise to work on fixing the inner cities , republicans will start getting the black vote they have long deserved .

0,"Mary Ann, I don't understand why you would be upset if Justice did not enforce a consent decree. Mr. Obama's Administration totally disregarded immigration law and statutes to allow illegal aliens to enter freely into our country. We are supposed to be a nation of laws, not men. If laws are properly voted into existence, it is the job of the Executive to execute the law, nothing more. We Conservatives have warned about this that when the shoe is on the other foot, the Left will not abide what it had foisted on the country in a prior administration.  As one who did NOT vote for Trump or any presidential candidate, I intend to keep pressure on the Trump Administration to follow all laws as written and passed by Congress.

Trump won the popular vote in 30 out of 39 counties.  Unfortunately, Clinton won  all 12 electoral votes in this winner take all system.  Mob rule was considered by our forefathers and quickly rejected.  On a national scale a mob rule system would be controlled by a small number of states and would no longer represent the the nation as a whole.  Forty-eight states use the winner take all electoral college system.  Allocating the electoral college based on the percentages of the popular vote would truly represent what the voters want in every state.

Also, the policy that allowed the police to crack down on MS13 was the same policy that got that Coffee Farmer on the Big Island who never broke the law and was a productive member of our society deported as well.  As for the cruise missile strike, they gave the Russians a warning to get their people out of that air base which allowed most of Assad's planes to also get out.

I don't remember much protest when Brian Mulroney - together with Ronald Reagan - pushed Canada right wing down into the US orbit during the 1980's, into the 90's. Or when Stephen Harper did the same thing but much worse only a few years ago, ruling Canada almost like an American Republic. You need to register your protest immediately in the street. Waiting four years, eight years, or 10 years to vote for another party is much too little much too late. The damage done to Canadian democracy and Canadian values by the likes of Mulroney and Harper, with a lot of help from Jean Chretien, is practically irreversible. Is Justin Trudeau so different?

Besides, you don't have to be a democrat to see what a racist, bigoted, sexual predator Trump is, or how useless Don Young has become. All you need is a modicum of intelligence.

0,"Gee.  That sounds a lot like the 1944 law that created the GI Bill,  and was aimed at preparing for a post war America with affordable housing.  The max cost of a home was set at $10,000.  Most were in the $6-7000 range.  Levittown on Long Island was the first big development.  This country could do that again if Congress could pass a peach pit,  let alone some pureed prunes.  It takes vision,  guts,  and foresight to have a reasonable housing program for this country.  We ain't there.  Our present concern is to do nothing,  go backward,  and resist Trump.  So basements,  garages,  tents in the woods are what we have for public housing that is affordable.  Live with it,  while you resist.  When you're done,  it will be the other side's turn.  Learn Mandarin,  maybe some Russian.

Charisma-challenged Hillary drew merely hundreds to her rallies, and she couldn't excite enough of her supporters to vote.  The charisma gap (see Reagan, Clinton) was responsible for Trump winning the election.

0,"I believe the british born editors of the Globe are pushing their journalists to blame all evils on Trump and are stoking hate.  Trump is no more responsible for race relations and violence then Barack Obama is...  Affirmative action programs often create resentment and some of it justified by well meaning people who receive less favorable treatment.  The debate about affirmative action is not new so there is no need to repeat the pros and cons.  Blaming a President and his followers for racial violence that has been erupting monthly for 50 years is not only unfair it is, in my humble opinion, stoking hate and promoting violence.  The Globe under these editors is not playing a positive role.

Presumably they dropped even more on election day, and Clinton ended up only 2.1% ahead.  So . . .  the polls worked out pretty well, thanks.  As you said ..... """"lol.""""

It's simply because Trump supporters don't care if he lies through his teeth...they're too busy jumping up and down like 6-year olds screaming """"we won, you lost, we won, you lost"""".  Trump has spent the first two days of his presidency complaining about television ratings and attendance numbers, rather than focusing on the business of the American people. But his supporters, a herd of simpletons if there's ever been one, are just too busy cheering on every ignorant tweet.  It's generally not cool to derisively label 62 million American voters but we are in unprecedented time here.

Qatar is trying to reshape the Muslim discussion but Saudi is having none of it, imagine a women allowed to drive a car, or not wear her burka, no way it is going to happen. Trump is putting this area back into the dark ages and they think it is of as they buy up American weapons to repay there US friends. Arabs do not have friends in low places.

They were very briefly cowed, but they never really seemed to learn any long-term lessons from Watergate or Iran/Contra. Indeed, Ronnie's admin was the most corrupt in history, and the cons simply adore him!   If anything, they might learn the wrong things from this - such as it's worth even committing TREASON with RUSSIANS if the cons get to stack the judiciary with radical right wingers.    I'd much rather the outcome is that anyone would be very ashamed to admit in public that they are a Republican and/or voted for Trump for at least a few decades.

0,"If Trump """"repatriates"""" manufacturing jobs to the U.S. it will not be good for EITHER Canada or the U.S.  The U.S. tried this before in 1929.  That turned what should have been a recession into The Great Depression.  Sure some jobs came home due to reduced imports but their exports plummeted causing far more job losses then those """"saved"""".  The kind of moves that Trump is hinting at (though it is probably just senseless bluster) would be devastating to U.S., Canada and Mexico.  The only countries that would really benefit would be the likes of Germany and Japan who are otherwise not involved.  Canadian and Mexicans would buy more German and Japanese-made goods rather than U.S. made goods and similarly Americans would buy more German and Japanese-made goods rather than Canadian or Mexican made ones.

0,"There are two key questions here. 1) What is the effect of being a """"sanctuary city?"""" The primary purpose has to be for the local police to not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. This is actually essential for good policing. If people are afraid that the local cops will call ICE on them, they won't go to the local police for help when that sort of assistance is needed. 2) What can the Trumpolini regime do in retaliation? As the article pointed out, not much. In addition to the discussion in the article, there is federal appellate case law to the effect that any withholding of funds has to have a nexus to the federal-local conflict. In other words, a conflict over immigration does not provide the Feds sufficient reason to withhold road funds. It could justify withholding funds that would go to law enforcement, but since much (most?) of that funding is oriented towards increasing militarization of the local police, losing such funding would be good.

Hells bells he spent five years bellowing about the tremendous evidence his investigators had turned up in Hawaii that proved President Obama was not a legitimate president. He was lying of course like he does so routinely that his followers have to keep moving forward under a cloud of fake/right wing news in order to deflect attention from that steady stream of lies and insults.

For that year,  we know he did. Yet Trump promised to release his taxes and now he won't. For some, not a big deal. For people who hold politicians accountable, it should be. A lie is a lie. Hillary could still be right. He may not have paid taxes in some years. He had some big carry-over loss. And it is certainly legal. And it's legal for a lazy person to stay in public housing if they qualify. So it's OK for Trump but not our lazy person? Both are legal. People like to cite """"legal"""" as some sort of get out of jail free card.  But what is legal is determined by rich politicians beholden to corporate backers.

1,"Trump has promised to """"repeal and replace"""" the Affordable Care Act. He has no proposal to replace it and apparently no intention to replace it, but with the cooperation of a Republican congress, he may repeal it. The predictable -- the utterly foreseeable -- result of withdrawing healthcare from many of the millions of people who obtained it by way of the ACA will be an increase in the number of both direct and spontaneous abortions, increased infant mortality, more deaths from complications of childbirth, and death and illness spawned by lack of medical care and inadequate nutrition. We don't need a crystal ball to see this future; as you rightly point out, we have history to confirm it. The notion that Trump is pro-life was always preposterous -- a cynical, hypocritical and dishonest rationalization for voting for a racist, for a fascist.  Trump's campaign was relentlessly anti-life, and, unfortunately, his administration will be, too.

0,"Yeah sure. This initiative will be implemented in 2017.  Check the tax brackets then. Next the tax rates between the 2 countries are way too hard to compare. The lower class in Canada have a better tax rate but the wealthier/middle class in America have a better tax rate due to tax deductions, etc. Trump will be lowering tax brackets and rates across the board. This will most definitely change the attitudes of skilled workers.  You then Show tax rates of top earners being 33% in Canada. That is over $202,800 for highest bracket. Then compared to the USA highest bracket at 39.6% but that top income is double that of canada and some at $415,000 for a single person for both countries. If you wanted to compare the tax rate for the same earnings being  $200,000 the. They would both be at 33% but like I said earlier the deductions in America would be a net benefit in the end.

If you said Russia, you guessed right. As a matter of fact I met one of the heroes (Medal of Honor equivalent) of their war in Afghanistan. My men hung out with the Russian enlisted guys all the time.  As you know, my post wasn't about Trump's specificity, it was about what he may be doing.  Since I am neither a republican or a close confidant of Trump's, I can only speculate at what he may be thinking or doing.

Their questions were understood by Sessions at the time to get at whether he spoke with Russians in order to influence the elections, and he answered accordingly and honestly. But now the questions are reframed as being far more general so they can be used to criticize Sessions as if he were lying. The falsity of this can be exposed by remembering that President Obama was supporting and campaigning for Hillary. Did anyone question him about talking with Russians during that time? Of course not, that was part of his job, just as it was part of Session's job as a Senator. So those questions could not have been supposed to carry that broad meaning at the time they were asked, but have been re-parsed by the Dems now to use as a political weapon to prevent Sessions from doing his new job and create doubt about Trump.

0,"Bubbles, Just so you know, while you weren't looking, the Syrian war has ended.  600,000 displaced Syrians are peacefully returning to Aleppo. And you thought Trump wasn't a successful President. . Obama drew lines and sputtered but did nothing, well actually he did worse than nothing. He prolonged the misery of   the war  by dithering, promising, breaking promises, drawing red lines and then moving them which led to an empowerment of Isis and a handful of gullible rebels thinking  they had America's support. . Nafta?  That was Bill Clinton's gift.  Another mess. Why put that on Trump?  Iraq is pretty well done with the retaking of Mosul that Obama lost. We are building bases there to stay indefinitely like we did in Germany and Japan after the war.  Oh, that reminds me, another DEMOCRAT who 'interred' people in concentration camps because of their race and nationality.  What was his name?  Oh yeah, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

"
1,"""""Trump says hacking did not affect U.S. election outcome""""  Two, no, three points.  One, the issue is whether or not Russia (versus the 400 lb boy) attempted to interfere in the last US election by getting access to private data and making it public. This, apparently, is true, as Mr Trump's denials are now mute. Two, there is no way that Mr Trump or anyone else can say that this interference was, or was not, effective. Three, by saying that 'hacking did not affect the election outcome' Mr Trump is communicating that he believes (with ample good reason) that the people he expects to be listening are fools.  I get the impression that Mr Trump was under the assumption that 'hacking' was some sort of technical wizardry akin to black magic, and as such could never be 'proven'. His age is a prime indicator. Hacking is dull, boring, and like much on the interwebs, has really low hit rates. And leaves lots of tracks.

0,"I, as a rather distruntled registered Democrat, do believe the DNC favored Hillary Clinton in the primary nomination process to select the Presidential Candidate.  I feel their actions were tacky, tawdry, and disrespected the political process of the Party's nominating process.  They did not, however, violate any laws or collude with any foreign operatives in the process.  We do KNOW (yes, for a genuine FACT) that operatives of the Russian government interfered in the general electoral process to enhance the liklihood of Mr. Trump's election.  We don't know how much impact that intrusion had on the election.  The real question being investigated....and the issue which has Mr. Trump and his inner-circle so nervous....is the possible involvement of high-level Trump campaign officials, including his son and son-in-law in directly cooperating with Russian agents.  All attempts to deflect our attention to the Democratic Party nominating process will still not change that fact.  Gary Crum

1,"I consider the author as just another non colleague with the leftist world view that accommodation of our enemies is the first order of foreign policy best described by Churchill as """"a person who feeds the crocodile hoping it will eat him last"""".   Trump inherited a foreign policy from Obama where allies no longer trusted the United States and enemies neither respected or feared the United States.  The Middle East is in total chaos.  ISIS is in 28 different countries controlling large sections of both Iraq and Syria.  On Obama's watch  there have been over 700,000 slaughtered and almost 2 million refugees most of which  are young illiterate Muslim men have migrated to Western Europe with a destabilizing effect as they have no intention of assimilating.  Putin regarded """"Obambi"""" as naive fool  so now the Crimea has been annexed and several divisions along the Ukraine border.  Russia is allied with Iran and Syria and has a new port.

0,"Benghazi again. No mention by Bill Northrup Of the Beirut US embassy bombing in April 1983, which killed 63 people including 17 American embassy staff, mostly CIA plus a USAID officer and a couple of guards. Six months later, Lebanese insurgents car-bombed a US military barracks in Beirut, killing 241 US military personnel including 220 marines.  Congress then did not launch a witch-hunt against Reagan. Yet today, Republican loyalists still talk about Benghazi as though it was some sort of unparalleled disaster. Reagan's pointless screw-up is passed over, as are the huge embassy disasters under GW Bush.  This is not right. Anyone can see this is not right. And if the Bill Northrups of the world succeed in taking away the right to private reproductive children from women, as we all know Republicans are keen to do, then the people will suffer for their complacence. Personal rights are hard-won but easily lost. We all will lose rights under Trump, in fact it's happening right now.

As a result,  the DNC can't even be trusted by the members of its own party. The party's great strength  is its ability to raise millions from billionaires in New York and California and the TV ads the money generates can attract lots of voters nationally--- more  money, more TV ads,  and more votes nationally than Trump. However, its weakness on the ground at the level of state organization means that its support is inefficiently distributed and marshalled.

They think he owes them what?  They showed more support for Ted Cruz & he's almost universally hated in the Senate.  If they showed themselves capable of passing any legislation whatsoever they might have sandy ground to stand on.   McCain, for example, has been out there saying how the DoD doesn't need another CR - He's the one in the Senate responsible for getting an NDAA passed!  It's his !@#%$^ fault.

0,"This sale of Norsat was made public 2 days after Freeland declared the U.S. all but dead and Canada would announce a new foreign policy backed up with a new military budget, including 3500 additional Canadian troops some day. Obviously the two are related.  As Canada leaves the American sphere for China, what do Canadians think will happen the first instance that Canada turns to China to fill the American void?  As it is, this sale is siding with the Communist Chinese against your own intelligence, U.S. and NATO. The Chinese must have known they would lose their U.S. and NATO customers which probably means this isn't a business interest deal. As divided as the U.S. is, there are many things you could have done to placate China and poke a stick in America's eye and actually gotten support from Americans who hate Trump. Blatantly putting the U.S. at risk for 40 million dollars isn't one of them.

People dislike the guise of refugees/ immigrants and the lovey dovey BS that goes along with it. I don't need a lesson on that and it was not even my point. Once again trump and farage and the next eu leaders are very relative to the point of immigration. My second point was the fact that all countries steal from there citizens and launder. We citizens get screwed from every country. You can say the we launder to the USA but it's politicians, republican and democrat. The USA launders to ME, Canada etc and the liberals and conservatives here are happy. They all seem to dislike trump which should be a big clue to his relativity in not only immigration but all policies. Once again I can clearly see the idiot.

They still believe he is capable of changing everything single-handedly even when he failed to repeal the ACA with a friendly majority in both chambers of Congress.  There is nothing that will pierce the zealous belief they have in Trump.  I bet he could walk up to Betty White, bend her over against her will and spank her on live national TV and they would all fabricate some justification for his conduct so long as he doesn't admit it outright on Twitter.

Once the new director is invested, the Bureau may unleash a full on examination of the many treasonous acts of former Secretary of State Clinton. She has done greater harm to our national security than either of the Rosenbergs and they were both transferred to Sing Sing 64 years ago so they could ride Old Sparky.  Picture Felony-Shrillary strapped to a gurney, awaiting the needle full of death juice, continuing to babble that nothing is her fault.  Now THAT would be Justice.

0,"I think you don't get it, JDart88. Have you heard of priorities? For most of us,  it's a no-brainer that the thousands of deaths per year due to gun violence should be a much higher priority that a handful for terrorist caused deaths. Both are regrettable, but if thousands of your citizens are needlessly being killed, maimed and injured every year, that issue needs attention. Yet Trump has spent $0 on gun violence issues, and who knows how much on anti-muslim actions.
"
0,"Trump is taking action where others sat on their hands. Obama slid by for  8 years with only one goal, trying not to make any mistakes.  That's not leadership. Obama would be a guy I'd want to have a beer with, but not run my country.  He's like Jimmy Carter.  Very nice. Big smile, but not a leader.  I'd be willing to tackle a giant rabbit any day with Jimmy Carter, but he let American hostages languish for over a year in Iran. It took the threat of a Reagan Presidency to finally convince the Iranians of their folly. And in confronting a nuclear Iran (thanks Obama) or North Korea?  I want someone  who has resolve. Someone who makes decisions. Obama was very good at drawing red lines in Syria, but it took Trump to stop their use of chemical weapons. He won't hesitate and they know it.  Terror comes from all over, but these 6 countries are embroiled in the heart of """"the war on terrorism""""  Why don't you take a vacation over their and ask them? They might be amused.

And if you're interested in delving deeper into the issue, there is abundant detailed information on her campaign website about many subjects. Sadly I can't say the same about trump.  I rarely hear anything substantive from him, no detailed policy proposals, no thoughtful ideas to improve our country.  It's clear he doesn't know much if anything about our country or our government, and it's also abundantly clear that he's not interested to learn.  I find him to be unsuited and unfit for our presidency.
"
0,"As you said, America is everyone's home, how about seeking common ground based on the real issues instead of what Trump may or may not do.  In my opinion America has become focused on getting your way regardless of the methods used or consequences. This is evidenced heavily by the DNC emails as well as the """"spin"""" and out right lies by both major parties. Both parties are equally to blame here. It is further evidenced by the people in their """"echo chambers"""" trading propaganda instead of researching genuine facts.  Instead of vilifying and demonizing people that have a different opinion than you, try to understand the reasoning for their opposing opinion. We as a people need to move back to the days of reasonable compromise and respect of differing opinions. We need to draw social lines where one group is able to oppress another, prohibiting these actions equally.  Most importantly, we need to demand self accountability for ones actions, hold everyone to the same standard.

1,"Why would you lie about me spending """"most of my time"""" commenting?  What are you talking about?  Can't you ever write truthfully?

His approval rating is swirling the drain and his administration is being buried under a deepening pile of lawsuits.  He can't be removed from office soon enough.  Trump's a pathological liar who has now shown himself to be a Nazi sympathizer.  He's a piece of garbage.  Thankfully, the courts will protect the country.
"
1,"Not all populist movements are created equal. Anger is the lifeblood of the Trump base and he continually stokes that anger. He may not be overtly racist (that's debatable), but he certainly has done nothing to discourage racism among his supporters. Trump is a coward and an opportunist who refuses to call out even the most egregious offenders within his base.  I don't know how to heal the deep divisions in the body politic, or even that they can be healed, but I do know that it will never happen as long as the two sides continue to demonize each other. When Trump stops his name-calling and his belittling Tweets and starts acting like a statesman, then maybe I'll start believing he's interested in healing division.

Furthermore, Steve Bannon, CEO of the Trump campaign and rumored to be Trump's pick for Chief of Staff, is a white supremacist and guru of the alt right, a white supremacist/anti-Semitic movement.

0,"It is worth emphasizing two changes rushed through yesterday by the Trump Administration.  One change removes restrictions on coal mining companies, freeing them up to pollute streams and forests with the waste from coal mining.  The other change keeps it private when American oil companies offer huge, bribe-like sums of money to overseas officials to get access to oil fields, removing a previous rule that required such payments to be publicized.  It is unclear how any Trump supporters would """"sell"""" those policy changes to regular, everyday voters. Indeed, both rules are going to benefit the top one percent (suit-wearing executives at the coal and oil companies), not the little voter guy whose family fishes or drinks water from the streams, or who wants more clean, home-grown energy independence for America.

Read the things that these people, members of his inner circle, his personally selected appointees, say daily through anonymous quotations to the press. (And I assure you they say worse off the record.) They have no respect for him, indeed they seem to palpate with contempt for him, and to regard their mission as equivalent to being stewards for a syphilitic emperor.

In looking over my comments on this thread, I hope nobody comes away with the idea that I'm an apologist for either Bush or Cheney. I agree that both were harmful to the nation. My biggest disappointment with the Bush presidency -- and with Cheney as its principal architect -- is that after 9/11, when the goodwill of the world was with us, we had a unique opportunity to exercise a new model of moral leadership. Instead, we reverted to the old paradigm of revenge and bloodshed, as Osama bin Laden predicted, and turned moderate Muslims into fanatics. We'll be paying for that mistake for decades.  That said, I'm all about moving forward. If Bush can help turn the tide against Trump and this toxic, dysfunctional political climate, I welcome it.

Palestinian human rights fall under both ethnic and religious human rights and was an important issue due to the strong pro-Israel / anti-Palestinian stance of both the Republican and the Democratic parties.  Many Bernie Sanders supporters did not vote for Hilary Clinton because of her strong support for the right wing of Israeli politics, thanks to huge financial contributions from Zionists like Haim Saban and Sheldon Edelson, A women's right to abortion is of course very important for any women's movement, but close to three million people marched on Saturday for a  lot more than just that.

And it’s not as though the Trump administration took any effort to keep the lower bureaucratic offices they inherited properly staffed or funded while the new crew figured out how to work the light switches…   Just a buncha guys from the old neighborhood, hangin’ around, shootin’ the breeze. They’re not running the country, they’re too busy running the ongoing Donald Trump campaign / crime cartel.  THANKS, REPUBLICANS!

0,"The USA has two immediate neighbours, Mexico and Canada...in fact Canada is on a corner lot and the USA has an adjoining property not to mention a couple of small intrusions in Ontario/Manitoba and BC where unless they are content to access those bits of their property by water, they require land access across our property!  In most communities if one neighbour wants to build a fence, the other neighbour is only required to contribute to a basic chain link fence and unless they come to a shared agreement where they agree on a design where both sides are of equal aesthetic value, the one building the fence must build the good side out...including that facing the street.  Donald Trump has asked for bids for the """"Mexico fence"""" to be a wall, good side facing in...I'm surprised it wasn't a golden mirrored finish...or at least an orange tinted glow!  Regardless, given our neighbour isn't even schooled in fence etiquette why can't all Canadians support our Government as we turn 150?

Health insurance was expected to cover day to day health costs. If you wanted catastrophic coverage added on,  it was very cheap as it had high deductibles. All Obamacare did was create a system where everybody was paying for catastrophic coverage at a super high rate, but you are stuck paying your day to day health costs because of the very high deductibles. This was all smoke and mirrors. The Republicans cannot keep President Trumps promises without more smoke and mirrors and they know it.

Since the Green Party will not form government, and it has indicated it will support the BC Fascist government with any seats it may win, a Green voter would have to be compared to a Trump voter in moral and intellectual attributes.  At a minimum, the Green Party voter is defacto condoning the death by neglect of a further 1000 kids in Ministry custody and no chance whatsoever of any change in the electoral system. The BC Green voter is an immoral puerile malcontent that takes no responsibly for the massive destruction their foolish vote might engender.

My sense is that Trump tried very, very, very hard to stick to what was written for him on the teleprompter.  He succeeded fairly well, but it seemed rather unnatural for him.  We shall see how he adheres to what he said today, including getting over the trivial disagreements between the parties.  I fear that he may be the first one to violate that.

She doesn't deserve to be judged on the basis of staying with Bill or his baggage and she shouldn't be expected to think kindly of his various mistresses. She doesn't deserve to be pilloried for saying she would like to contribute to civic life at a somewhat higher level than cookie-making. Anyone can make cookies. That is a fact. It's too bad if the housewives and their hubbies got upset. The fact is, if powerhouse Heidi Cruz had had a shot at the White House, she was planning to go back to her old job at Goldman Sachs, thus shattering the First Lady Thing altogether. It's time we stopped assigning this ambassador role to spouses anyway and started letting folks choose their own path.

Trump's initial comments were extremely weak.  He tried to """"have it both ways"""".....to appease folks while carefully avoiding alienating his supporters from the ault-right, the white supremacist movement and the white nationalist movement.  Only when the public outcry from across the political spectrum reached the point where it could not be ignored, did he make the statement he should have made in the first place.  True courage, dignity and character are extremely important characteristics for leadership.  They are, unfortunately,  IMO, foreign concepts to Mr. Trump. Gary Crum

0,"Though the worlds largest user of oil is the transportation sector, which is moving toward EV's, between the natural rate of growth in vehicles world-wide and the very slow incremental increase of EV's due mostly to battery technology, the use of oil overall will continue to increase for our lifetime. Plastics, fertilizers, etc are major consumers of oil also, and there is no replacement in either sector. The North Slope infrastructure is developed and that sunk cost can produce in excess of 2 MILLION barrels per day. Given today's low rate of 500,000 barrels, the marginal cost of drilling is quite low, given the remarkable production of North Slope wells, commonly over 5,000 bpd, far outstripping wells in the lower 48, typically @ 100's bpd. The key is pipelines to the new discoveries and that is the immediate, major cost. The Trump administration would do well to sponsor new PIPELINE development on the Slope, with those pipelines earning the PPP their payback. Develop pipelines NOW!

The Yanks finally held the field only because General Lee was so outnumbered that he had to consolidate his forces or the Yanks, which outnumbered him by more than 2:1, would have been able (even under the dope McClellan) to surround elements of the Army of Northern Virginia.  Lincoln used the battle to free slaves in areas controlled by the Rebels and keep slavery (and Fugitive Slave Laws) in the Border States and areas of the South controlled by the Yanks.

There is no incentive to not use the system and thus we have the debt ridden system. If health care is in the private sector there is an incentive to not use it, rather use it as necessary.  I have seen no evidence that suggests that medical insurance must be mandatory.  Another similar system is social housing. What an expensive mess. Imagine if that was replaced by money so that the poor would have some selection in where they live, same as people with money, namely live where you like, where you can afford. Cities/communities  would not have to build and maintain housing.  We have thousands of examples of the private sector working well.

All of Skov's endorsements are progressives, the same type of people who are responsible for Trump's successful government pushback.

In 2014, the U.S. spewed 237 times more carbon dioxide into the air than Sweden, according to figures by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The U.S. is No. 2 in per person carbon dioxide pollution, behind Luxembourg, among 35 developed nations plus China, India and Brazil, Energy Department data show. That’s 19.1 tons (17.3 metric tons) of carbon dioxide per year for the average American, compared with 4.9 tons (4.5 metric tons) for the average Swede.  The U.S. ranks tenth highest in carbon pollution per gross domestic product according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. spews almost five times more carbon dioxide per dollar in the economy than Sweden.  William K. Reilly, former EPA head, says Trump is """"just wrong.""""

As was made plain by their questioning of former FBI director James Comey and the three intelligence chiefs last week, Democrats have moved the goalposts on the Russia investigation. They’ve all but given up on their quest to prove the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 election — the charge at the heart of the ongoing congressional investigations. They are now solely focused on pinning a charge on President Trump and ultimately forcing him from office.

"
1,"Pretty silly of Trump to try and take credit for a rising stock market when he passed no piece of legislation that could even be argued to have had a positive impact on the economy. The closest Trump could come to claiming any credit for this could come from an argument that business is spending more presently because they are anticipating the benefits of impending tax cuts. Even this is unlikely, however, as those effects wouldn't be seen in the market for months to come if the legislation even passes. What's most amusing about this, therefore, is that whenever Trump and/or Republicans praise the economic growth experienced in the US today and the policy regime that brought it to fruition, he is really praising Obama as this is his legacy, not Trumps.

0,"The DACA is basically illegal. If you want to keep it, it is necessary to change the immigration law in Congress. I am for this, but DACA has to go. It violates current immigration law. Ryan and McConnell know this, and should be getting in line to change the law rather than having Trump continue to violate it. It is another shining example of the swamp Congress has become and congressmen avoiding their responsibilities.

0,"Typical Liberal Newspaper, the local StarAdvertiser who only print one side of the story - anything against President Trump will do with the liberal media. LT. Gen Mcmaster, President Trump's National Security advisor says he was at the meeting as he met with reporters outside the Whitehouse.  The General said the New York Post (who else) report of President Trump sharing classified information with the Russian Ambasador is false.  Said McMaster, there was no Military operation against ISIS mention by President Trump. Again the Liberal media (including our StarAdvertiser) try to make a big thing when nothing occurred. The Liberal Democrats who were calling for the firing of James Comey late last year, are not rejoicing when President Trump gave them their wish in firing James Tomey, the are outrage like they do with the false news about sharing classified information with the Russians.

Regardless of how you feel about Trump, his proposed across-the-board tax cuts, combined with proposed infrastructure investment and military build-up, will reverse the shrinking deficit of Obama and accelerate the accumulation of debt.

Allow me a second to expound on this thought: if one were to take just the West coast and the NE Seaboard, and handful of swing states (Ohio, MI, ILL, WIS and PA) these states would represent almost 2/3 of the electoral college. So, what's the common theme of all these states, are all thoroughly democratic. This not even putting into play states like Florida or Georgia. The fact that remains, is that the Ds have over a dozen ways to win the White House, and converse is that the Rs have to basically sweep all swing states or take CA or NY-- never going to happen.  Drilling down even further, unless Trump can carry the Hispanic and Black vote with approximately 37-38 percent of their vote (as a point of reference, Mitt only obtained in the low 20s); he is currently in the single digits. No way..

There does need to be a way to eyeball those new immigrants, or else they are NOT welcome. For those people who come from poor countries with no functioning government and have no documentation, there is no way to identify them and they cannot come to USA.

Before you folks decided to be white, slaves were just the loser of the last war, regardless of color.

And the notorious VB Russian bank has provided cash to buy out bad projects and pay off the lawsuits against Trump. The Russians Trump dealt with were corrupt and tied to Putin. Some had offices in Trump Tower. Trump hired one and partnered on a deal with him-- the Trump SOHO tower-- he was a convicted felon, connected to the Russian mob, and turned FBI witness for reduced charges. The Russians have a reputation for ignoring the law, blackmailing partners, and wanting future 'favors"""" for help today. And Trump got help-- from VB bank for one (VB is blocked now by sanctions).

So that proves the drug war comment is not correct, or like most things he has waffled so much he appears to be covered in syrup. Also, his AG pick is heavily anti-pot and wants to enforce those federal mandates that will shut down state level pot usage.  As for the biased news media, there is no thing as bad press. Trump got over 1 billion dollars in free air time from the networks. Fox commentators admit he was prompted and even was given all the questions to interviews to rehearse.  He got the news to pay attention by saying things that were bombastic with little to no regard to whom they hurt or even if they were true or not.  So yeah I am going to take with a grain of salt anything Trump says cause the two instances you brought up are are easily shot down.

Superficial things like body language and the sort seen during debates and so on is so shallow that a thinking person would not base their evaluation on them.  Why don't you have a look at Trump's website and go directly to the policy sections and have a read.  Tell me which policies (as stated on the website rather than by the media) that you don't like.  Similarly, visit Hillary's website and identify the policies that you find enlightened.  I respond to reasoned discussion of policy and principles.  I ignore and look down on gossipy personal BS.

It rarely rises above that level, having done so in 1984 (7.3%, tax hike and defense spending) and during the Vietnam War and in the early years of WWII. I guess Trump will have to pitch us into a long war with either North Korea or the rest of the world to catch up to Obama. Of course, he'll also eclipse Obama's national debt in doing so.

Oh well like she said about her husband abusing women, it's all in the past! The Clintons have such wonderful values, just like Hollywood that supports them and other Democratic Party members.

Attempting to govern by division, pitting one group against another, has never had sustained success and this time will be no different.  You can occasionally win an election with the support of an interest group but you cannot govern that way.  Trump seems incapable of understanding that and pivoting to the center.  Only 9 months into this presidency and already he has alienated about 70% of the American public.  He will continue to get support from his base, for now. But when they realize that he was never really planning or able to solve their problems, they too will reject him.

0,"Nobody went so far as to suggest that deplorables weren't people.  They were just people with moral values that had been skewed by years of economic stagnation while the rest of the country prospered. They looked for someone to blame, and looked for a saviour. They found a false prophet who offered people (refugees and immigrants) more vulnerable than them as a target for their anger, frustration, hatred and scorn. And the false prophet played into their fears of, and frustrations with government.  The deplorable people never got introspective and asked themselves what roles and responsibility they had in their own misfortunes. As a result, they doubled down and are now in worse shape and more trouble than they were before. And they don't even realize it.  And now Trump's little rich son is trying to dehumanize the 64% of Americans who have lost faith in his incompetent father. Doubling down, doubling down, and all doing the line dance to deplorable ruination.

0,"The private sector has had plenty of time to fix the healthcare crisis in the US, starting with the 1992 election when it became a big issue. Nothing changed at all. Obama ran in 2008 on a mandate to fix the issue, because the private sector simply couldn't fix it. If they could've done so they would have done it in 1992. They have run out of time and excuses. Trump has no plan that differs from Obama's. It will likely be a variation on the ACA, but then he'll claim its some radically new thing.

0,"Clear, concise, """"unimpeachable"""" analysis. The one point I would add is that President Trump's support among GOP representatives is soft.

Impeachment may therefore become a significant risk for the President before 2018.

From the standpoint of the environment, Obama ignored it for those first 2 years when he was raising the country out of the Great Recession and setting up the ACA.I was frustrated with both him and the Democratic Party for basically ignoring the environment at that time. BTW, I am not a democrat although I will probably have to rejoin after 35 years because of Trump!

It is not a hoax or lie.  It is probable and he mentioned it.  If you can prove otherwise then go ahead.  Your whole argument is not base on reality.  Trump admitted the Russians probably hacked them. No one can say for sure they had any influence over the election which is the opinion of the opposite side.  They are not lying either.

Still, at least Obamacare made a nod to addressing the needs of America's working poor and lower classes.  However, there is no place in a Republican America for the working poor and those who are down on their luck. Trump employed the typical bait and switch move: he mobilized racist and nationalist animus among the white working class and dangled promises of a return of fantasy jobs. Then Trump released a vicious budget that will attack the poor while he proposes to gut Obamacare and leave 20 million people without medical coverage.

The FBI and the world’s best intelligence agencies (NSA, CIA, DIA) have been investigation allegations of Russia’s involvement and collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign since last July and have come up empty handed, and it is driving Democrats nuts.  What is intensifying is the expansion of the investigation to find and question people remotely connected to the Trump campaign, hoping to find a smoking gun where none exists.  That highly place source in the Trump tower to be question next just might be the janitor working on the top floors.  You can’t go much higher than that.

I believe there were 17 this time and a grand total of 3 for the Democrats? When the wrong one started to win he had to be called to the white house and told to get in line by the President. Does it bother Democrats that they really don't get a say in who runs for president only the super delegates do? It would bother me. The Republicans didn't want Trump, they would have been happy with any of the other 16. I'd be sad if I was a Democrat because my vote and voice wouldn't count.

A single payer plan would have worked much better, but Republicans had to protect their insurance company CEO buddies, and make sure that the plan was as expensive as possible. Now Trump has lied through his teeth to America about the so-called Republican replacement plan which will guarantee bigger, better and cheaper coverage for everyone without cutting Medicare or Medicaid.  How's he going to accomplish this magical feat? He's not. The Republicans are trying to get people to believe HCAs you pay into - you know, because so many people have tons of extra cash floating around to put in an HCA savings account, especially one that cannot possibly cover any kind of serious illness, injury or chronic medical conditions-highly inadequate block Medicaid grants and Medicare vouchers, etc. none of which is anywhere close to adequate.

Oh, yes, and how dare he take his wife with him to Texas, especially while wearing high heel shoes walking to the helicopter on the White House grounds.  Obama never took his wife when he visited disaster areas, so why did Trump do it?

The other issue that is not well addressed is the issue of automation. Let's take the concept of self-driving vehicles and the potential of 3 million trucks drivers being out of work in 20 years. If that is the case then the workforce will be shrinking anyways.  Trump can't admit publicly that those jobs will not be coming back or that he will not achieve 3% annual growth or that even if he did, that type of growth does not create the same type of employment levels as it did in the past. Thus, the option is to shrink the labour pool in the short term to make it seem like his base is getting more jobs.

If you actually share his misogynistic view of women, that's your choice.  Your defense of Trump is pathetic....the old """"hey, everybody does it"""" sounds like a plea to a Junior High School vice principal.  No, Dun., not everybody is as crude and crass as Donald Trump. I know hundreds of men and, over my 74 years I've never been around someone who has made comments like Mr. Trump's.  He's surrounded by sycophants (that's PC for #@$#kissers) so those comments have been accepted and reinforced.  The man is pathetic....but, that hardly qualifies him to be president.  He's embarrassing enough as a candidate.  It's simply unthinkable that he could be president.

George Zimmerman was acquitted of the killing of Trayvon Martin on July 13, 2013. It was then that Black Lives Matter first became a hashtag—which lead to the creation of a network co-founded by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Khan-Cullors and Opal Tometi that since has expanded into a global movement dedicated to the liberation of all black people. Four years after its inception, the network is examining its progress and looking toward the future.  Under Donald Trump racial injustice is poised to get worse and black people are under attack in every way by conservatives and Trump sycophants for vocally asserting their right to live in a world free of white supremacy.  Black Lives Matter is an important player in helping people to build power, organize and work for change.

0,"It has been widely acknowledged before this article came along, that Trump is at present unpredictable. It has been reported on numerous occasions, that he says something one day, reverses course the next day,and then is off on a different tangent the day after. There is no preparing for the unpredictable, since there is no pattern that you can prepare for. Situations like these require that you be able to think as they say on your feet, and be ready for anything. Leaders are always prepped  for meetings with their counter parts, and Trudeau will have been holding mock meetings with his advisors. The problem as previously stated is that it is simply it would seem impossible to prepare for someone who has thrown out the diplomatic rule book.

0,"I read the quote and it did not answer my question.  I have answered your question elsewhere.    Plus, I believe you have seen me in person earlier in the year.  If you want further proof I already told where I was going to be Saturday night.  I will be the one in the purple shirt. I agree with Trump on asking when are we going to get official investigations into the real people that colluded with the Russians, as well as the Chinese and Mexicans.  Or are you going to ignore all the evidence about those problems.

0,"Agreed.  I was, as were many, disappointed that more of Obama's campaign agenda wasn't implemented, but of course it was impossible with professional obstructionists on the job.  Had he been an LBJ, perhaps more of his initiatives could have succeeded, but I don't think O hid who he was and what his strengths were (and were not) in either successful bid for election.  America responded to his idealism, his character, his dreams -- all of which were slimed by right-wing pundits and Congress.  Did he make errors in judgment?  Yes.  Does every president?  Yes.  Does he deserve this lambasting by a Catholic columnist who """"cried"""" at his inauguration?  I don't think so, and I find this column shameful -- particularly in light of the incoming president's lack of political experience, ethics, morals, intelligence and plain old good will toward America's citizens, immigrants, international allies -- and practically everyone who doesn't have a """"Trump"""" in their family tree. Disheartening!

0,"Good!  Our government is being completely undermined by what you can only describe as the """"deep state."""" People who are working counter to the agenda of those actually elected to lead this country. It's sickening, and frankly should be scary to anyone paying attention.  You might dislike Trump, you might think we're going in the wrong direction, and that's fine. But there are processes to address those grievances properly.  What's been happening with the leaks is wrong and dangerous.

I dunno, bad hoodoo. Like performing root canal on a tiger without anesthetic. It'll always end badly.

0,"Feinstein: Trump Jr. To Publicly Appear Before Senate Judiciary Panel  Just wait til Al Franken gets ahold of Junior.  It's gonna be epic.
"
0,"You are confusing me with Donald Trump. It's easy to tell the difference. I have less hair and less money, I don't believe in government, I don't indulge the religious right, and I wield a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer.  But I hear you, I also prefer my creationist brother over Donald Trump.

0,"Here's a question I thought I would never have to think about.....who's more trustworthy? The Kremlin or the Trump Administration? Yes, this is where we are. Sad!

0,"Having a too high a dollar is like being too rich or being too good looking, not a bad  position to have and one  that can very easily be changed.     Just more Establishment sour grapes.  Trudeau is the one in trouble, and if he cant deal with the new Trump reality he will face a non-confidence vote at the next available juncture.
"
0,"The ascendency of Sanders proves that folks will not accept the party of sales, profits and cheap labor much longer. (aka Republicans) The ascendency of Trump proves that the folks do not want a party of non-profits sucking off government, urban crime plantations, anti-free speech politically correct forced language and anti-Americanism. (aka Democrats) It's that simple folks.  Time for real change.
"
0,"Someone needs to brush up on those things called """"facts"""".  I know, I know, not your favorite thing.  Trump BARELY, and I mean BARELY, won the election.  He won't have the Russian bot machine to help swing less than 2% of the vote in WI, PA, and MI this time around.  I would say he will be obliterated in the next election, but we all know he won't survive that long.  Btw, obliterated means destroyed or wiped out.  Saved you from having to look it up.  ;)

1,"Mr Trump is not a fascist.  He is a populist and a demagogue, but calling him fascist just dilutes the meaning of the word.  There is no danger of brown shirted storm troopers if there is a President Trump.

0,"Far too many lies told here from the outset, from no russians no conversations then maybe russian salad dressing to more russians than in War and Peace,talking to everyone connected to trump.
"
0,"utitas, so you are saying the immigrants are having relations with animals.  This explains plenty about your championship of Donald Trump.  BTW, Trump has by his own admission, broken OT laws.
