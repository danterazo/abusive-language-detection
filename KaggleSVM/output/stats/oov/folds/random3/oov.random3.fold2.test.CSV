0,"The conversation has obviously moved on, but I find your post so puzzling I wanted to make a comment.  The hierarchy is a sacrament, a development of ordination. The bishops preaching is a sign of God speaking to us. That precedes the tenets and creeds that they propose. The tenets and creeds are attempts to explain how the sacraments and fellowship """"work.""""  The sacrament, as a showing of God's action, is prior to any system that explains them. And as a part of God's action, every sacrament is a mystery that cannot be fully contained within human thought and systems.  If you want to treat the hierarchy as a purely human structure, you can pursue that idea; it might even add to our understanding of the faith. It would be a novel idea in Catholicism.

0,"Dr. John Bockstoce, arctic historian and archaeologist, was doing an archaeological study at Cape Nome in 1972.  I was in Nome and spent many evenings listening to John talk about his work.  I remember is his description of the last major Eskimo migration across the Arctic about 800 AD during the Medieval warming period.  According to John the Eskimos could do this because at the time there was very little ice in the Arctic Ocean. We all know that the “green house” gases, predominately water vapor block certain energy spectrums from radiating from the dark side of the earth. This has been calculated to  add 19 C to the temperature of the earth. The question of the effect of CO2 is the same question as does the crowing of roosters cause the sun to rise or does the sun’s rising induce the roosters to crow?  Will anyone that can show the method that a change of 100 parts per million of CO2 “pushes” a significant change of the earth’s temperature please answer.

0,"Gov Walker had a successful career as an attorney fighting with the producers.  He's good at it. Sadly, it's his limitation as a governor. His approach is to build a litigation with the producers rather than a relationship. They don't trust him. No relationship, no trust. Alaska is not going to litigate the producers into investing billions in the gas pipeline. They have investment options outside of Alaska. He may be doing somethings right for Alaska, but that does not apply to the gas pipeline. This current brawl is ludicrous.  Oddly, he's become the roadblock for the very thing he's aspired to create.  He needs a leadership coach.

We`ll see how dedicated Murkowski and Sullivan are to the betterment of Alaskans and not to a party that would put us on the chopping block for affordable health care coverage for older Alaskans on fixed incomes and medicaid recipients.  We`ll see if Murkowski has the real stuff to make changes for the better, and not just go along with Trump and co. to cut taxes for the top 1%, putting lower income Americans` affordable health insurance and medical care out of reach.   Make it better Senator, not worse, for Alaskans. Trickledown care doesn`t cut it either.

The home price averages are skewed by single family dwellings, which will continue to spike in Toronto  . . but this category is increasingly irrelevant as there are no longer any new open-land single family dwellings to be constructed in the 416 . . . all the land is gone.  Townhomes and multi-res are the categories that matter to families of the future, and pricing and supply of these categories show a much better balance.  What TREB needs to work on is   shifting agents and brokers to accept $-fee structure, not a %-fee structure. it takes the same amount of work and risk to sell a $500k home as its does a $1M home, and TREB needs to recognize that sellers can no longer be gouged with a 5% transaction fee structure.

There was another case where the little girl was forced by the courts to go to her dad's even though the mom kept going to court with evidence of abuse. The girl ended up being killed at her dad's on a forced visit. So sad. As fas as taking it on Dr Phil I'm not sure if you realize that was before they had found Dylan's remains. Like any good mother, she didn't have any concrete proof yet that he was dead so she had to do everything she could to get his face out there and have as many people as possible know exactly what is going on if they do recognize him. She also knew he'd be offered a polygraph. Try and imagine your own desperation in that situation.

0,"It's amazing how nearly every week Wohlforth is widely praised , yet he dares to bring up common sense on pot and all heck breaks loose.  It is proof positive that pot drives people crazy-----it doesn't relax and subdue them as they claim the dope does.  For perhaps the second time ever, I agree with him on this subject .  No one who's been using dope for years is going to quit their regular supplier and pay more at a state legal / federal illegal pot shop. It doesn't matter what you have at home--be it pot or potato chips and soda pop---the more there is--the more kids are going to get into it.   Alcohol is worse than pot , but two wrongs never make a right. Parents have a hard time feeding their kids in Alaska as they need government handouts at record levels. Now limited family food money will be spent on dope instead of food  . Our kids who depend on us lose .  Alaska will be worse off with more people screwed up.  We have hurt ourselves by voting to legalize dope.  Shame on us .

0,"Why? It's about money and power, not the environment according to the U.N IPCC. The United Nations has publicly stated its goal is not to ‘solve’ climate change, but to seek to redistribute wealth and expand its authority through more central planning. UN official Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chair of the IPCC Working Group III, admitted what’s behind the climate issue: “One must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy … One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.”  That's just part of the global agenda. There are many individuals, organizations, universities, scientists, and corporations who make a lot of money promoting man-made-catastrophic-global-climate change.

If West Ukraine wasn't unilaterally attacking East Ukraine, there'd be no conflict. West Ukraine is an example of fascism, being the neo-nazi centre of the planet, having banned Russian-language books, having a government which was not elected democratically, and invading other regions in an effort to subdue them through violence.

0,"Awhile back SF invested millions in homeless services, transitional and long term housing, mental health and addiction counseling, health care, dental care, job skills training, placement and ongoing support, legal aid, case management, veterans services, access to computers and phones, every possible public benefit. After five years they studied how it all worked. What they found was very discouraging: the majority of homeless they served moved into the housing and used the services, but did not give up the street life. The transitional housing became occupied permanently by formerly undomiciled people who never became self supporting; never transitioned to somewhere more stable. They went home to their new apartments when they wanted to shower and sleep, went to the free Doctor or dentist when needed, but mostly they continued to spend all of their time back on the streets.

0,"The early Christians, as described in Acts, got enthusiastic and sold all their property and gave all their goods to the Apostles in an attempt at 'Christian Communism'.  First result was that it laid on the Apostles work beyond their 'job description'. They couldn't handle the distribution of goods and so turned to the 'laity' to nominate 'deacons'. A second result was that when famine hit, Paul's communities had to take up a collection for their support.  The 'solutions' meant well – but they did not  recognize the underlying problem :  that people were selling all they had and expecting the apostles (Bishops) to manage everything.  Our problem today is similar. We have created a system of 'clerics' as episcopal delegates and turned all authority over to them.  In the early church the 'laity' had all the chrisms needed to 'build up the body of Christ'. We need to acknowledge that the Bishops CAN delegate their functions to laity.  Our 'system' is our problem.

It works the same way when you try to lose that pound of fat. You have to sweat a lot more than 3500 calories.

0,"Although I can see the need to keep increasing minimum wage, I am a little lost on how the government can see the economy footing the bill for a 23% increase in wages over a two-year time frame...I get their thinking, that everyone is a liberal and works in a unionized or government job, where that type of an increase is common, but in the real world of the working class, something has to break. A lack of growth in the minimum wage over the past decades create this issue, I get it, but we can't and shouldn't be expecting to make up that ground overnight, it's just not a  sustainable model. How about we legislation that requires grow in wages and ties it to the economic growth of the province, then minimum wage is directly aligned with not just 'What' the government does, but also 'How' successful they are at it. Then watch the polls as all the parties strive to make a real contribution instead of the flash in the pan approach all of them take now.

Kevin, the organist (Evelyn) in our Parish Church did not go up to the Altar to receive Jesus in the Holy Eucharist because she knew she was living in sin and did not want to offend Jesus further, but she was attached to the sin of impurity until she realized that she was indeed offending Him by choosing to continue having sexual relations with her boyfriend. She needed to hear in a loving (not judgmental) way that she has to choose between God and sin. What I always found humbling about Evelyn was the fact that she used to go up to the Altar and cross her arms over her chest. In this way, the Priest knew she was there to receive a blessing but not to desecrate the body of Christ because she was not in the State of Grace. I believe your example of Joe and other remarried Catholics who have not obtained an annulment (continued)

In some formulations, tributylamine is replaced by diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), allowing sarin to be stored in aluminium casings. In binary chemical weapons, the two precursors are stored separately in the same shell and mixed to form the agent immediately before or when the shell is in flight. This approach has the dual benefit of solving the stability issue and increasing the safety of sarin munitions.""""  Nobody believes the weapons dump story. Give it up.

The current bill (the House version, I haven't had a chance to look at the Senate version yet) is not a replacement or even major overhaul of the ACA. The AHCA could charitably be called a TWEAK.

Islam then took the Christian version, recast the """"messiah"""" as a great prophet and added their bit about the super ultimate prophet.  Aside from that the three Abrahamic religions are pretty much the same. This is why fundamentalist Islamic sects have so much in common with fundamentalist christian groups when it comes to how they view women and LGBTQ folks.

Application of the term fascism to Russia is a bit problematic in that fascism and Marxism are seen as opposing forces.  So likely fascism is not a realistic descriptor of Russia, but demagogues apply it just for viscerale reaction.

Keep the rates down so $ invested in value driven and/or dividend paying stocks to offset the low rate of returns.  However, GDP was ~ 1% .  Currently the Trump Rally is real and since the election the effect on the market has driven Dow by 15%  and SP 13% .  Be aware the market is driven by future looking investments and there may be adjustments along the way and should be expected.

0,"So if we illegalize abortion, it would therefore mean worse forms of abortion will be committed? So we must make it lawful, since people are doing it anyway? And thus, make it a much more effective, clean, and less messy process? Murder is murder no matter how you put it in terms of much more sterilized or less sterilized environments.  The idea of protecting life at all stages as best as one can, is not a numbers game. Just saying abortion has dropped is not the purpose. It is to enact laws when one can to protect that human life to the same equal dignity and rights afforded them as anyone else has. Their circumstance or factor of set characteristics of birth (i.e. handicap, sick, born in poverty, etc.) do not dictate if they should be welcome to those rights as human beings.  People who are of marginal circumstances or born with a certain skin quality and color are no less welcome to those rights because they were born as slaves.

Look around low rental housing how many expensive new cars do you see, how many new 4X4 trucks with big tires & lift kits, and expensive sound systems but yet they can only put $10 worth of fuel in the fuel tank at one time.  Then with $10 of fuel in the tank they go buy a case of beer, another pack of smokes at $11 or go down to the local bud shop for however much that's costing.  Last week behind me at a stop light was a kid driving an almost new black Dummer w/more chrome than I'd ever seen on a vehicle.

NAFTA is/was clearly a right wing push--it clearly fits in with their pro-free market beliefs. They saw HRC as a continuation of their historical sell-out--they saw a crass opportunist who did not stand up to the Wall Street fraudsters.

If you accept that climate change is real then warmer climates and lower water levels in rivers is going to be a continuing problem for them, and elsewhere.  2) Regulation in the case of a nuclear power plant is a Very Good Thing. The only reason that nuclear energy is the safest (!) form of energy today - killing less people than most other renewables - is because of these regulations. And yet we still get disasters like Fukushima, Three Mile Island, and Chernobyl. It's thanks to these regulations that since the late 1980s the number of nuclear accidents has significantly dropped. People get emotional because it's scary.  Another argument against nuclear and for other forms of renewables is exactly that - renewables are decentralized and as such less likely to be susceptible to state oversight and overreach.

Nelson """"Pete"""" Shields, one of the founders of the largest gun control lobbying group which is now known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said it best:  “We’ll take one step at a time, and the first is necessarily – given the political realities – very modest.  We’ll have to start working again to strengthen the law, and then again to strengthen the next law and again and again.  Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns, is going to take time.  The first problem is to slow down production and sales.  Next is to get registration.  The final problem is to make possession of all handguns and ammunition (with a few exceptions) totally illegal.” -New Yorker Magazine, June 26, 1976

(we know this is not true but there are so many offshore companies who really knows). So it is just business we sell jeeps they sell oil, which we do not need as we have more produced in Canada than we require internally, we give the extra to the US who make big money off it.  The second thread is when the JEEP project came forward it was to be done in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. But the Government of the day said no; the JEEP project can only go ahead if they are made in Ontario.

Religious fanatics will not give you any right in their countries so there is no human right, women right or any right in their country of origin but wherever they go they want to get privilege for their religious believes. Then, terrorist activities start and many innocent people get killed. Those religious fanatics don’t respect universal laws but they want to impose their questionable believes to the world freedom lover people otherwise they would stay in their countries instead to spread all around the world.

Lebanon, who has a population of just over 6 million has taken in just over 1 million refugees or 17% of their population (some say that one quarter of the population is now made up of refugees).  http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=122  If the United States were to take that same proportion we would be taking in 54.9 million refugees.  Obviously it is not sustainable or logistically possible for the United States and Lebanon is having a very difficult time hosting so many refugees (most from Syria).  Currently there are, perhaps, 1.8 million refugees living in the united states.  We can and should be doing more.  Also keep in mind that things will get much worse around the world before they get better with many refugees being pushed out in future decades due to climate change.

The root problem here is that the folks in Ketchikan were trying to get the government to subsidize their tourist industry instead of taking care of the problem themselves.

Just a short summery, but the person referred to was not Christ but the Lord Mithra who predated Christ by 1 000 years.

That was a pretty sweet deal for medical administration as well as care providers.  We should also ask why the Party has done nothing to force medical providers with care for medicare patients.    Because of regulated pricing, physicians can apparently just claim they have no room to take on medicare patients.

If that is true, accusing Spadaro of name calling is likely inappropriate. Do the charateristics that you call “name calling” exist among the values voters? Do they practice an “ecumenism” on the basis of opposing other factions? Do they divide the world into us vs. them factions on he basis of fear? If so, then Spadaro was “onto something,” describing rather than name calling.

This government will pour billions into First Nations, projects, while cancelling audits on how the money is spent and yet wants specific measurements tied to money for healthcare. I would argue that you show know where the money is going, but you have to apply the same rules to all recipients of large sums of money. healthcare is a funny thing , it's never uppermost in our minds until we need it. At which point we wonder why we pay a health surcharge, why we pay taxes, and yet there seems to be billions sent out of the country and billions spent for any number of projects, and yet arguably the most important project, the health of the nation is subject to negotiation. This is an issue worth fighting for.

That's not necessarily the case, and sometimes ownership costs can rise faster than the rental market can bear it.  The other big issue that's often neglected is that the average tenant benefits from the fact the average apartment is much better capitalized than a new home buyer. When your landlord's only got 50% mortgage, lower carrying costs  free up a lot of space for maintenance that wouldn't be available were you to buy in and be 90% financed.  That capitalization is probably the single biggest benefit to renters.

Not only does feds pay for medical costs for miners, but retirement as well. In addition, while oil/Nat gas access to public lands  pay about 1/3 what they should ( and that does not include what O/G has done to tribes ),coal pays less than 1% of what they do for private land. Fourth, none of that includes the health costs that oil and coal have caused which is much much higher than subsidies for AE and nukes.

The atmosphere is mostly transparent to the sun's incoming electromagnetic energy which is concentrated in the visible wavelength bands.  But with more greenhouse gases, the atmosphere is not so transparent to the earth's reradiation of solar energy which is concentrated in the infrared bands.  So heat gets in but does not so easily get out.  The planet gets warmer (barring negative feedback such as higher cloud concentrations).  Weather is much more complex and the assertion that the number and intensity of storms will rise is not a scientific consensus only a media consensus.

0,"These statements and views on humanity are unassailable.  Otherwise, the broad inductive freedom used to justify narrow deductions is flawed.  For example, a native Hawaiian puuhonua was a DISCRETE VENUE of UNCONDITIONAL immunity from criminal enforcement.  This op-ed's fair comparative then is that Hawaii be ENTIRELY a puuhonua for the world's criminals.  But, that proposition is clearly unreasonable   This unreasonable association similarly applies to medieval churches.  Apples are compared to oranges here.   Political involvement of religion  is a A slippery slope.  Human charity is pure service despite politics.  Whereas, social policy with respect to human charity is more politics.   We may agree with the authors' beliefs.  Nevertheless, their thesis is fundamentally flawed.  The conclusion here is that churches ought to be allowed in government matters.  Yet, there is no substantive argument on the constitution's separation of church and state.

While the details are EXTREMELY fuzzy at the moment it looks like part of the deal is that the provinces will subsidize child care for lower income families, presumably being phased out as income rises.  So if, for example, a parent decides to pick up an extra shift that pays them $100 gross, they pay tax on that PLUS they get a reduced child care subsidy.  Ohh, and they get reduced Canada Child Benefits, reduced GST/HST credits, possibly reduced electricity benefits and property tax subsidies (Ontario at least), etc. etc.  Just how much will that extra $100 be worth?  That is EXTREMELY difficult to calculate.

0,"Well, going by Thomas Pakenham's version of the history, which I understand is largely accurate, Rhodes really was not the driving force.

As to the deaths of people in the concentration camps, which did not previously exist, Rhodes could not have foreseen that while seeking business advantage in Transvaal. As with most things, it's all shades of grey. It is an achievement, though, to be hated equally by the Boers, liberals and the new South African elite. The ironies are many and Packenham mauls Rhodes for his behaviour in the siege. He made enemies freely, no doubt about that. However, the bequests he had the vision to make with the idea of furthering world peace through educating the best students shows a great positive and there only IS a  respected Rhodes University because of him

Today's scientists mostly agree about recent changes but oddly no one theory was become foremost as to the cause of the events of 700 to 150 years ago. Regardless of the causes of the Little Ice Age it had a huge impact on plant, animal and human populations so we have historical documentation for what happens to all life when the climate changes in a big way.

However, there was was a more controlled scientific test of Marx's theories conducted in a couple of countries. It was simple. Take a country, divide it in half, operate one half under Marxist theory and use the other half as a control group. At the end of the experiment, East Germany had 1/4 of the per capita income of West Germany, so the experiment was ended on humanitarian grounds. We're still waiting for the results of North Korea vs South Korea experiment, but at this point in time North Korea has 1/20 of the per capita income of South Korea.

A lifelong affection for the arts generally begins at home, at an early age, although I've met those who were raised in arts-averse homes, yet were able to pursue a higher education, find an affinity for the arts while in college.  Not even taking the bush into consideration, here in our urban and suburban areas there has been and will always be two very different Alaskas.

In the final analysis a state as large as Florida can be very closely contested but will cast all electoral votes for one candidate. Why? Obviously, some states have seen the light and divide their votes according to popular vote. I do not see any benefit to making it a winner take all situation in any state. The current system makes it quite possible for a candidate to win the white house even though an opponent may have 60% of the popular vote. It is time for all states to make the alteration to their electoral college system.

Presumption of innocence entails the crown must establish the guilt of the accused,  not the accused her innocence. Basing conclusions on credible evidence is a basic principle of rational inquiry and belief.  Neither principle is universally shared---check out totalitarian regimes in the 20th century where political utility trumped these standards. Nor does either dictate what standard or level of proof or establishment on credible evidence is required. Certainty, beyond a reasonable doubt, or simply probability? Butt's omission of the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal convictions is worrisome.We need to resist tampering with it.

The TSP largely overlooks driverless cars, for example.  This oversight is a missed opportunity to influence how driverless cars will become used in Eugene and overlooks innovative solutions to today's transportation problems made possible by technology advances. Driverless cars can lead either to increased or decreased traffic. Future city laws can be envisioned that discourage vehicle parking and limit time durations when a driverless car is unoccupied. Such laws may seem strange now when individual car ownership is the norm. However, they can promote shared use of driverless cars and entrepreneurial opportunities. They reduce the need to own a car, make available land now used for parking, and allow roadway reconfigurations to better accommodate pedestrians and bicycles.

It should never be used for political reasons or in situations where others are likely to be unwilling to participate.  But my personal preferences are neither here nor there.

Even more frustrating Comey revealed in Senate testimony the breadth of the counterintelligence investigation into Russia’s effort to sway the election and that Comey was """"grandstanding"""" the Russian probe and not investigating internal leaks within the government.

0,"According to decades of investigation by biologists, there are no races, so racism does not exist.  What does exist is discrimination based upon often ludicrous criterion.  For example, an Asian woman who refuses to date Asian men is, racist.  A Caucasian man who prefers Asian women is also a racist.  Most dangerous is that race is used as propaganda to demonize anyone who might criticize someone who does not possess certain criteria.  It is a dangerous label and we would do well to stop using it.  If you criticize a murderer, you are anti-homicide not a racist.  If you criticize a rapist you're anti-rapist, not a racist.  The use of the word race and racism is now so widely abused that not only are religious people a separate race, but people who speak different languages, and nonwhite persons who have slightly different hair colour.  I might point out that always having a muslim write about muslim issues and never offering a critical examination is, as the word is used, racist.

0,"I think it would be dangerous to pull a tooth on someone while on a hoverboard. Have you seen the videos of people flying off of those things? You’re basically using tools that resemble (for the lay individual) screwdrivers and pliers while performing an extraction. What if the hoverboard quit functioning like it should while you had those in the patients mouth? How about him allowing his OM to extract 2 teeth on a patient, while they were sedated (and while she was wearing a sportsbra might I add)? Does she have any formal dental training other than him telling her what to do? Some trained dentists struggle with extractions and don’t like doing them. Both of those instances seem dangerous to me.  I’m with you about feeling for his wife and kids. I do feel bad they have to be exposed to this and go through things they shouldn’t have to. It goes to show you that your actions affect more people than just yourself, and his actions were very selfish.

Then deed the improvements to Morgan's holding company,  and give them a permanent easement across the farm's private land.  For that,  you could pay $0.14 a KW hour in 1932 dollars.

Most of the money raised goes to advertising (not paying employees), perhaps politics just needs to run on less propaganda..  Besides, Canada has a PM that was elected on selfies, and a need to change the channel from the prior government, Trump just go elected in the USA using twitter, and thus spending less than 40% of what his opponent spent.

The big Regional Corporations are  very separate   for-profit entities which must try to generate income in the form of dividends for their own shareholders just like any other for-profit corp.

It  struggled financially for years but has done well enough in recent years to make  modest dividend payouts to shareholders. Villages can be for profit or non profit corporations- Governmental functions are vested with  the village corps, property is mostly vested with the Regs. http://dhss.alaska.gov/ocs/Documents/icwa/pdf/AKNativeRegionalCorps.pdf I do think that if Kusilvak can unify like the  Kotz area has, Reg, local government, and other entities, they stand a real chance.

Simple grade 6 level reasoning, people. The idea doesn't contradict a dream of a colour-blind society; it compliments it by acknowledging and challenging the fact that we're nowhere near one yet.

(After seeing their variety of creatively attractive hanging-basket arrangements, we could never settle for the lousy/all-the-same & overpriced & often-parched baskets at the supermarkets and HomeDepots, etc.) .  Larger local nurseries + the big-box stores have long bought a lot of pricey media adverti$ing, but none could outdo down-to-earth Patty&Anna's advice & creativity, their reliable perennials & great herbs, or their lovely & whimsical topiaries.  Thank goodness longtime customers' word-of-mouth 'advertising' kept WONDERFUL Suttons in business for so many years. .  Lastly, I hope they get a bundle for their property & get to have a great retirement. .

As part of its membership of Star Alliance, Air Canada will presumably require all other Star Alliance members not to let Aeroplan buy seats once it is no longer a partner. It is the same with the blackout periods, restrictions on seats, etc. These exist because Air Canada does not open up certain blocks of seats to its partners. Aeroplan gets a bad rap but the reality is that Air Canada is a lousy airline and an even lousier partner. It is to be hoped Aeroplan can find another airline to partner with, but given the lack of competition in Canadian skies it remains to be seen.

0,"I think that until the Church admits that what John and Edna say is true, the credibility of the Church's teaching on abortion suffers because it is seen (by expert Catholics who actually do the loving) as part of an  anti-sex agenda.  And we must stop using """"abortion and contraception"""" as a collective noun.  Discerning, loving Catholic men and women KNOW to their very core that the perverted--right word--view of Augustinian thinking is, how should I say it, WRONG. Yet that view permeates Church teaching, discerned wisdom of laity lovers to the contrary.  To dismiss and to  mock the learned  wisdom of Catholic couples is to (sinfully?) assert a myth that those  lovers who """"know"""" have less prayerful insight than those who do not.  Until the Church says """"We are called to  trust prayerful and conscience-formed couples to make decisions about how to fully love each other, responsibly guided by their ROLES as faithful lovers more so than by unaccepted-by-conscience RULES"""".......

So do I rent a 2br to someone for $2000 or do I air bnb it for $4000 a month? Well considering the $200,000 in fees I laid out to make it a legal 4 plex and my increase in carrying costs I may just have to air bnb it. Hence taking another 4 units off the market even though I went through the process and had intent of using them as rentals for tenants not tourists. Why doesn’t the city incent me with waving the fees but put a condition in that I can’t air bnb and I can’t charge over X for so many years. That would be the smart thing to do.

All this means is they can post 30 day rentals and make backdoor rental agreements of less than 30 days with the vacationers.  This still puts the burden on the City's inspectors to prove vacationers do not have a 30 day rental agreement.  The inspector has to go to the house, speak to the vacationer and they have to admit that they do not have a 30 day rental agreement.  A lot of times the vacationers are not home, don't answer the door, are coached to say they have a 30 day agreement or are non-paying guests of the owner.  It's even harder in large gated estates where you have an intercom.  The inspector must interview the vacationer face to face.  The inspectors investigate other complaints as well as vacation rentals and they don't have the time to park outside the house waiting for  these people to come outside to speak to them.

The basic question that NEEDS to be answered is why did the cost go from $5 billion to $10,000,000,000? $10 will likely turn into $12-15 by the time it's done. That's just the start of the shortfall. Next, we'll need to address the low ridership numbers that will cause an ongoing shortfall. Further, the cost to operate will be far more than initially projected. Finally, the ongoing capital repairs and improvements will far exceed even the wildest of imaginations. On the one hand, I have little sympathy for Oahu taxpayers as they voted in Caldwell. On the other hand, I believe Caldwell along with Mufi and a few others were directly responsible for a bait and switch. The bait?

Pad the pockets of the unions and key construction company owners who, in turn, kick back just enough for the next election of the stained politicians. I'm just saying.

While Imago holds firm to the Bible, we've got open arms to people, whether that means worshipping together or just working closely to do good with people the world would like to cast as our enemies, like former mayor Sam Adams.  So come visit! Jesus never taught that you had to agree with Him to be loved by those who try to follow Him. Quite the opposite, in fact. He set up the church to be a hospital for sinners, not a museum of saints, because every one of us there lives in sin and needs His grace. You and me both.  By the way, i'm surprised as anyone to hear about Jules. I had no idea we had a mayoral candidate that went to Imago. Big church, after all...

0,"Steve, thanks for your service on an all volunteer EWEB Board. About % layoffs: 1. At Gray’s EWEB’s Energy Future talk (7.16.12), Bob Cassidy asked about down-sizing: with 50 positions gone this past month, have we hit bottom, does everything else have to be covered by increased rates or lay offs?  (So, +/-10% layoffs took place in 1 month and some later.)  I am 99% sure media quoted upper management that 40% had been let go during the several year downturn by layoffs, attrition, retirement but reporting may have been inaccurate.  2. Roger Gray at a Rubicon lunch (last public talk he gave as a lame duck) cited the 40% figure from my recollection. He would never provide me a copy of his speech or notes so I apologize if I am wrong.  3. At EWEB’s work session minutes, reviewing cost drivers, Roger Gray said _they would have to lay off between 60 and 100 employees under one scenario._ 10.19.10. Did this occur?  A problem with EWEB I observe: staff find it difficult to admit mistakes.

I feel HB 247 will kill Alaska's oil Industry faster!  50% royalty is not the answer, my goodness Alaska is 2 1/2 times the size of Texas and no one is bidding in your DNR DOG state oil lease sales with their recent increase of 1,000 to 8,000% rental increase!  Make Alaska more attractive and less!  I would say lower the minimum bid and royalty and start bidding lower. Some business is better than none for Alaska's income needs!  I guess you did not go to the Department of Natural Resources Division of Oil & Gas May 2016 lease sale for the Cook Inlet, or the Beaufort Sea oil and Gas Lease sale in Nov. 2015 when they tried increasing the lease sale contract terms!  Lower the harsh terms, no one bid when rentals up to 8,000% increase, no one bid on the hundreds of tracts offered on millions of acres, fact!

Nobody can say exactly what or who to cut, just """"cut positions"""". Of course, they're generally the first people to screech when the streets aren't plowed fast enough, the sanders don't hit the intersections they use, and there isn't enough money to fund the protective services (fire, police, etc). If Alaskans truly want to see what kind of waste happens behind the scenes, look into how our politicians operate. During the session, they ship offices, household (right down to the artwork hanging on their walls), vehicles, and more. Plus they receive ridiculous amounts of """"living expenses"""". And please don't take my word on this, go talk to the staff at the LIO. You'll be amazed at the blatant waste of money.

However policing ourselves is much different than asking individuals to start  policing everybody else.   This would be akin to asking the inmates to run the asylum  I can tell you exactly what will happen with this new forum model,  because I saw it first hand with both Komo 4 and Seattle times.  The collective themselves will become bullies and start rejecting everything they find as not being politically correct.  in the end that will  turn out no different than the typical bully that we all love to hate (Those that purposefully use offensive language, attempt to start fights without rhyme or reason, and those that break nearly if not all forum rules.)

So there you have it; the taxpayers bailed out the banks, they kept their golden parachutes and went back to business creating bigger golden parachutes.

A rational businessman would not give up that $5 of income to avoid paying, in this case, an extra $5 in tax.  The tax would in fact be marginal and, whatever the highest tax rate is, would only come into use after the income reaches some threshold, e.g. $150,000.

NJ was a no brainier that in the aftermath of the Christie disaster, a Dem would win.

Yes Quebecers appear to be cry babies.  That said it works for them.   They cry loud and it gets them what they want.  We see it all through society.  Does it apply to all of them?  Of course not but it applies to enough that we can see how it works for them and we can predict its occurrence just as we can predict that anything that comes out of the CD Howe institute will overwhelmingly favour the rich and not the working slob.  Generalizations are generally true, but not always.... except in the case of the CD Howe.

0,"""""Starve the beast"""".  When CA passed property tax relief and OR followed I suspect most people weren't aware of that agenda.  Did we get that the top priority of incipient corporate oligarchs was to break public education, necessary to get a majority of voters to shaft themselves?  These measures passed school funding shortfalls onto the state without outlining how the states were to find the funds.  Schools that were, in spite of the propaganda, working were broken.  I opposed Measure 5 because of that.  Everyone pays property taxes one way or another but income and other taxes can be squirmed out of. I saw Measure 97 as a start to fixing education until I looked at legal opinions indicating that once the money hits the General Fund it's fair game to the state. Oregonians already pay """"market will bear"""", that's the corporate pricing model.  But a well-written measure would establish a new fund and specifically split the revenues, collected annually, off to the intended recipient.

When serving the public interest is more costly than not doing so, there is an incentive to be complacent. When serving the public interest displeases the advertising customers there is an incentive *against* the public interest. This is an incompatibility that will not stand, and history will soon grind away the news media as we know it today.

In my clinical practice of assessing and diagnosing a clinical condition of a patient during an examination, I would have less information available to me than what Trump has displayed to us all.  We have live viewings of his insulting fellow republican debaters, infuriating them all one after the other, his insults to gold star mothers etc. as I wrote above.  You are correct that diagnosis ought to be made on personal contact, but in the case of Trump his self exposure is so drastic, excessive, dramatic, self absorbed and complete...we have a litany of offenses from him all through the night on a daily basis.  Then we have the word of both his ghost writer and his biographer making similar complaints...Trump's entire focus is solely himself, his concern for others is based entirely on their usefulness and benefit to him...otherwise he has no use for them.  That is seen in his refusal to pay contractors when work is completed.

A drop-in center for children is a different mission from transitional housing for adults.  The mission statement includes such goals as a medical clinic and insuring mental health and substance abuse treatment if needed.  The mission statement addresses needs of teens, not young adults.

0,"I know first hand how my personal insurance policy purchased when I turned 25 and no longer covered under my parents health plan before ACA, has changed over the years. I am in a high risk category being a cancer survivor. Even so, before ACA when I purchased my BCBS of Alaska health insurance plan, given I have a high deductible $5,000 per year. I paid roughly $120.00 per month. Over the years my plan has been grand fathered in thank goodness! Otherwise with my current income ( since that is really all the marketplace cares about) and not qualifying for subsidies, being 30, I would pay roughly $1200 a month for the same coverage I used to get for $120.00. People such as myself should pay more for health coverage as we are a more costly risk to insure. Why, because I have become a successful member of society should I  be forced to pay a portion of other people's insurance? This isn't about who is in office, it is about health care being unaffordable.

Contrary to what prohibitionists are so desperately trying to get the public to believe wholeheartedly and without question, legalizing marijuana IS NOT adding anything new into our society that wasn't always there and widely available already.  Marijuana has been ingrained within our society and part of human culture since biblical times, for thousands of years.  So, since marijuana has always been with us and humans already have thousands upon thousands of years worth of experience with marijuana, what great calamities and """"Doomsday Scenarios"""" do prohibitionists really think will happen now due to current legalization efforts that have never ever happened before in all human history?

0,"Cursive evolved as a faster style of handwriting when more documentation was required for increased  business transactions between the Europeans and the Far East.  Not lifting the writing instrument for each letter allowed the hand """"to run"""" over the page.  Cursive handwriting became the standard form of  handwriting, and the only method taught, for many centuries.  Printing (the previously called """"lettering"""" from centuries ago), was re-introduced into school curriculum around a century ago.   It was then that teachers first learned if you cannot write in cursive, you also are unable to read cursive writing. At that time the theory was that teaching printing would make learning cursive easier in grades two or three.  This was the process in North America for many decades.  Then those who developed curriculum decided it was WHAT students wrote that mattered, not HOW they wrote.  So today we again have students who are unable to read and write in cursive.  Calligraphy is an art form.

0,"silly argument there.  Pretty much every fine dining restaurant and family restaurant you can find doing business will serve you meals with significantly MORE calories than  big Mac, with more butter than 3 of any meals at McDs, and of course tons of salt.  McDs is not unique whatsoever.  The main difference is that people eat at McDs frequently and they are using frozen and heavily processed foods of very low quality, while the french dining room is using fresh vegetables and fine meats.  Though the nutritional value is not vastly different in the end, and the fine French meal will make you a lot fatter with higher risk of chronic diseases if you eat it regularly.   Look at family restaurants and it is worse - where steaks come mainly in 8-16 ounce portions these days (6 is more than too much), not uncommon for these restaurants to be 2,000 calories plus

And that's why I could never support somebody like Ron Paul. He spent decades earning a lovely congressman's salary and the only thing he ever did was go around giving speeches about why he shouldn't have to do the job the people he was giving speeches to were paying him to do. Corruption is just like any other crime - it follows a risk/reward assessment. It happens when the risks are small compared to the reward, the size of government has no influence on that. How many travelgate convictees are in jail ? None. In fact, none of them even lost their jobs ! Corruption is bad because the corrupt is not punished or even just fired in this country. That makes the risk tiny, while the rewards are great. Want to cut corruption ? Punish it like any other massive fraud with decades behind bars.

Demand-side economics seeks to soak the productive through high taxes and inflation, redistributing the proceeds to net tax receivers who will then spend us into economic Utopia.

He was one of the cops involved in the Rodriguez shooting, and he used the tactic of parking away from the scene so there would be no video evidence when he went to arrest Mr. Fotso. I don't know if the jury believed his testimony because the prosecutor offered a deal after the defense attorney called one of the victims to testify.

Trudeau 2.0 was the least qualified, competent and able to govern of the five Liberal candidates on offer.  For example, Marc Garneau despite his doctorate in astrophysics, his record as Canada`s first man in space, his sterling performance as CEO of the Canadian Aerospace Agency, and his soaring intellect had no chance when the Liberals chose between The Space Man and The Space Cadet.  This is because the Liberals had, as usual, zero interest in picking the best person to lead the country and 100% interest in picking the most electable person regardless of what happened afterwards.  Getting and keeping power - nothing else matters in the LPC.  So unlike the CPC race among 14, now 13, impressive candidates offering a wide selection of backgrounds, personalities, styles and platforms, the Liberal race as with all things Trudeau was a charade with the result predetermined.

Of course I didn't work up there because I didn't know anyone from TX, OK, etc.  About that time most Slope oil service companies made sure their new hires also filled out the form to get a Card. Often before they headed north for their job in Alaska. Within a month, an Alaska driver &/or hunting license; for official proof, if desired.  Many Slope workers once pressed to show 'Alaskan proof' were sure to get a duplicate of their home state driver license, one they could surrender in Alaska (say it was lost; they didn't check back then) to get an Alaska driver license -- yet have one for 'back Home.'

The part about requiring government departments to identify wasteful spending within 100 days of him taking office is a great step. The path this country is on is bankruptcy. If you think everything is hunky dory, just wait until our bond rating drops (which has almost happened) and everyone begins off loading the bonds. It is a financial nightmare given our bonds are the standard across the world.  People think a lot of what he said isn't true and is grim, but it really is true. The more refugees we let in without checking them out only increases our risk for internal terrorism. People need to wake up and recognize the problems before it is too late. In business, they teach being preventative. We need to be preventative and not reactive. Reactive has a much higher cost.

I think the seven decades of CPC brutal rules, the non-stopped cycles of violent and vicious political campaigns have stripped the people of their humanity of empathy, kindness, dignity and free will.  When people all around you starved to death (during the Great Leap Forward); beaten, humiliated and killed (during Cultural Revolution), you did all you could to survive (or even got ahead), humanity is a luxury.  All these happened at a national scale over many years, it takes a toll.  With the same party still in charge and grip tighten with lots of Chinese cheering on,  I am pessimistic that the cultural descendants of Confucius will ever recover.

0,"Something to ponder about the Maple Leaf organization and their commitment to winning.  Let's suppose that MLSE had only one objective...and that was to fleece the fans and make as much money as possible with no concern for the on-ice product because of the well known perception that Leaf fans will buy whatever spin and story the organization puts out following the words of Harold Ballard """"Why should I put out a bunch of Cadillacs on the ice, when I can sell out with a bunch of Volkswagens"""".  Then logic would dictate that they should find the cheapest coach possible, have as few scouts as possible, and keep head office staff to a minimum.  After all, zombie Leaf fans will buy anything.  In reality, MLSE pays the most for their coach and has the 2nd largest scouting staff of any team in the league (2014 data).  The MLSE organization seems to have a different objective than the infamous words of Harold Ballard.  Let's see if they keep to their re-build plan.  Seems to be working so far.

I drive the roads of Bainbridge frequently & am appalled at the lack of turn lanes on the highway and pot holes on the back roads.  And yet, their police force has fancy vehicles and patrol all over.  Bicyclists and pedestrians hog the back roads and don't move out of the way, making traffic cross into oncoming lanes to go around them.  Commuters have to contend with ferry traffic and bottle necks.  Or they take back roads and have to risk their necks to get onto the highway.  Wake up!  Solve the real problems!  Pricey projects shouldn't be a problem since the land and real estate taxes on the island are so high.  If Bainbridge residents prefer their forests and bicycles over safe road conditions then the Seattle ferry should be relocated to Suquamish or something.

Transport Canada messed this up and they should fix it so that it is completely  transparent to me and my son. BTW there is no linkage to the US system as we can fly out of Buffalo on Delta with no issues. It's just with Air Canada and West Jet.

China hit back with a massive attack and just about wipe out MacArthur force, forced a historic retreat. In humiliation MacArthur wanted to nuke China, thus WW3. Truman stopped MacA's madness but allowed massive bombing of NK to placate the big general. Well NK was not the one who wiped out MacA force, China was. No matter, MacA ordered Gen. LeMay WW2 style carpet bombing like Tokyo and Germany. Not a square foot of NK was spared. 3 million North Korean civilians were killed including all animal lives, all farm land destroyed.

The only way that them not working on a better system  with no ban in place makes sense, is if the temporary part of the ban was a flat out lie.  My bet is that is exactly what happened here.

Plus a 5-year GIC ladder. And a low-cost global equity mutual fund for my mad money. And another low-cost balanced mutual fund to keep cash distributions invested. So even the simplest portfolio can have slight complexities.  I used to consider adding REITs, short-term or high-yield bonds, or preferred shares. Or dividend stocks. A lot of segment ETFs have much higher MERs. Every time I think about it I realize that a lot of those holdings would concentrate my portfolio, not diversify it, while adding costs that might never be overcome by any performance gains. So simple wins for me, to a point.

As for people currently serving, it's important to make sure that every service member is contributing to readiness and cohesiveness and effectiveness. Don't read into this what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that transgendered people are not doing their jobs, I am saying that nothing, including political correctness, should prevent any commander from removing any service members if there is an issue with maintaining readiness and effectiveness.  We've seen this happen with service members known to be sympathizers with terrorists like ISIS.  If a transgender is creating a problem (and again, I'm not being specific, but anyone can create an issue that deserves discharge) they should not be protected just because they are transgender.  And I think if you want to transition to another gender, that should be handled outside the military.

0,"Reasonably and logically, can we assume that the vast majority of the 300 million plus firearms in private hands in the U.S. started out at one time as legal sales? I'm sure there have been thefts from gun stores and perhaps even armories; maybe even firearms being smuggled in, but the quantity of these has to be peanuts. The illegitimacy of the firearms that you claim, without foundation (of course, you must be excluding police shootings), are responsible for urban deaths, starts with a legal purchase. I'm 4 square in favor of removing illegal guns from the street, a few at a time, as long as its done without exposing the public to unnecessary harm. Not that it will impact our societal problems regards gun violence one iota and in that way not much different than the war on drugs. Kind of like the carnival wacka-mo (sic) game. The source of """"out of control"""" gun violence is cultural, deeply ingrained in the character of this country - exploitation, racism, misogyny, and war.

So, perhaps what looks like corruption to us white folk is a little different in a traditional community.

Jordan didn't tell courts to get cases to trial much faster - the ceilings are longer than the ones that previously existed. Jordan explicitly included provisions *not* to stay cases where the parties relied on the old law and took their time, and Courts are using those - the murder cases were stayed because it was clear under the *old* timelines the approach to delay and prioritization was unconscionable. Jordan told Courts they could actually get cases to court slower than they were previously allowed to do it, but that the consequences for not meeting that ceiling were going to be firmer. Before Jordan the acceptable delay was around 18 months for a case that's now got 30 months to proceed.

No one seriously expresses anything about the Harcourt government except that it was good. Likewise, there were many years of good NDP government under Gary Doer in Manitoba.  The NDP, like every party, is capable of good or bad governance. Making predictions about whether John Horgan will provide good government based on what Glen Clark did in the 1990's is ludicrous.

0,"You miss the point.  It's not just the time spent in front of clients or working directly on their portfolios.  You cannot break it down to an hourly costs because they are responsible for portfolios 265 days a year.  They are there to react to markets and keep their clients on the right course.  Of course there are bad advisors who buy a mutual fund for their clients, take a commission, then never talk to them again.  But the majority put their clients' interests first and constantly monitoring portfolios.  Also, I have no ides what GP compensation is like, but they typically spend 5-10 minutes with each client.  If you extrapolated the government rate for that, it would likely be massive.  However, we are not paying them for their time, but also their years of expertise.  Another difference is that we have socialized medicine here in Canada.  That keeps costs down, but comes at a price.  We wait months and months to see specialists as a result.  But that's another debate.

Reflexive, lame and tragically correct.  What we really need is gun-owner control.  I'm the son of a combat veteran.  He taught me guns are dangerous and should only be handled by people trained in their proper use.  That includes storage, with separation of weapon from ammo.  That's what the military and law enforcement do with their personnel.  Including those who won't use firearms in their job.   If all gun owners would just do that it would eliminate accidental shootings by children.   It's time for regulations directed at gun owners.  Mandatory gun safety training in high schools.  State licensing of gun owners.  Strict regulations on the storage, transport and resale of firearms.  Require pins to be worn by persons bearing arms in public places.  Simple and logical.

Perhaps leave in the deduction for children and that is IT. then put a progressive tax on ALL MONEY MADE. IOW, you get an hourly/salary, an inheritance, alimony (no, it is not a deduction for the other side and no child support is NOT money made ), profits, stock sales, bank interest, etc. are all taxed on the same scale. In addition, the scale needs to start JUST ABOVE POVERTY.  Everybody that is not on gov support should pay. Yes, the low end should be 1% or something like that. Very small.

0,"@SRWU, Car companies could care less whether they sell ICE or EV as long as they can sell what they produce. Economics 101, supply and demand. The issue with electric is there's no demand making production at scale a waste of resources with current technology. Back in the 90s, California tried to legislate how many ZEVs had to be sold. They wanted to gradually increase the numbers to 10% of vehicles sold by 2003 but the legislation had to be rescinded because despite incentives, sales were anemic and still are.  For a variety of reasons, principally range and charging infrastructure, there's still only a minority of consumers that can justify owning an EV, especially if it's their only vehicle and until that changes, EVs are a luxury, not a necessity. Until your EV is capable of making all of the trips that your ICE vehicle can, rather than just the short trips around town, it's a niche product.

0,"Tolls and user fees are inevitable.  In some cases you can see why.    Eg:  Mississauga is protesting about sharing in the cost of the LRT expansion.     Of course, Tory dropped the ball in a big way by not informing Mississauga before the announcement was made (typical Tory).    But it highlights the difficulties of getting various levels of Govt to agree on funding, let alone manage a project.    This is why infrastructure lags in Canada.   Canada has too many levels of Govt, all wanting their say and piece of the pie.  In fact, using Mississauga's reluctance to share costs as an example of how and why user fees may be the wave of the future.   EG:   a congestion toll or access fee to the downtown core could be made so that commuters from outside have to pay a toll to drive in the City.    This will help to  """"drive"""" more people to use transit to access the City core which will benefit in terms of increased transit user fees, as well as reduce car congestion in the core.

Being on Social Security Retirement as my sole source of income, after paying my bills that come due every month, I'm lucky to have $100 to $150 left that has to cover my food, gas for my vehicle, and other necessities.  I would have to save for months, if not years before I would have enough money to pay the required fees, plus get the required training.  Until that changes my RIGHTS are violated, and nobody gives a damn.  I helped with everyone else in getting the concealed carry laws passed in Illinois, and now that I've expressed time and time again the issue, they don't care since they got their permits.

Only deterrent to overwhelming military force is nukes.  Until North Korea feels safe, they will not back down.

In my opinion they shouldn't try to occupy the same ground as the Liberals. - Agreed on your last point. - Should the CPC fare poorly in 2019, I would look for Gerard Deltell and James Moore to throw their names in for the next leadership contest, along with Ambrose and McKay.

That's why it's a good idea to study the experience of other countries who accept transgendered personnel and don't think they're disordered.  People get hormone therapy for all sorts of reasons in the military. I'm guessing that the issues associated with needing hormone therapy aren't the same as associated with medication for ADHD or asthma. If you have been prescribed medications for these conditions recently, you may not be accepted because either illness could potentially affect your readiness level. Being transgendered isn't a sickness and doesn't affect readiness in quite the same way.

If you do the math at just $50.00 per barrel, our take comes to 36 billion in revenue over the life of that field. Prices will probably average higher than that. Also, it does not include the additional income, property, and borough taxes. Not all of that oil is necessarily recoverable at this time, but Prudhoe was estimated at beween 8-9 billion recoverable when it was discovered. With new technology that number has almost doubled.

Neither I nor mine owe African-Americans anything  because of slavery. I have black friends.  I have had black co-workers. I have spoken up for Civil Rights.  I have opposed Apartheid before Mandela even went to prison.  I have supported affirmative action.  I have tried to recruit Colin Powell to run for President - long before the Dems nominated someone far less qualified.  I did not vote for Obama, but I wished him well - and delighted - for a time - that we had a President who was black.

It takes a long long time to become a physician and there simply isn't enough TFSA or RRSP room to make up for those years spent in education.  If the graduate has a family, i.e. they decided to have children before mid to late 30s age, then their spouse has likely sacrificed their career and potential retirement savings as well. There is a big difference between being able to start saving at 25 years old vs 35, which is when many specialists begin to practice.  Plus, there may not be as many jobs available in Canada as many current physicians will likely be forced to defer retirement to make up for the increased taxes.

0,"A bit further musing here.  I agree with you, but I find the increasing amount of foreign ownership more troubling than 'free trade' because it tends to remove mind share from the country, and put the reins somewhere else.  At least in a trade deal between equals the economy of both countries stands to gain, and if the playing field is level, which it never is with China, and increasingly not with the USA, you do control your destiny.  To my experience, foreign owners also tend to make decisions that favour the parent over the branch plant in terms of innovation, sourcing of expertise and cost consolidation efforts.  Foreign ownership by Americans was a significant media pre-occupation in the 1960s and 1970s and abated during the 'free trade' era.

Probably most of the families of the Dreamers came across the border legally as tourists or on some sort of work visa, and overstayed their visas. There is no special illegality of Mexicans as compared to Russians, except in your mind. Why is that? Do you even understand why you are insisting only Mexicans are illegal?  You struggle for a difference that isn't there, but there is no difference. Those Dreamers are required to stay in school or work, and commit no crime. They are probably better citizens than many of our legal citizens.  And no, that's Lord Twyfraud, to counter your Eric Norsnot. Equally juvenile, but more appropriate.

The pope should acknowledge that they are not a religious order; he should dispense them from their vows, or clarify that the vows have no ecclesial significance; he should withdraw their patron and all clergy attached to the Knights; he should exclude the Knights from participating as religious in liturgical celebrations; and he should suspend or withdraw diplomatic recognition while the Holy See and the Knights work out whether or how they relate to each other going forward. It appears that the Knights are a cult, not within the church, but opposed to it. Perhaps Cardinal Burke will find himself more at home in that cult than in the church.

It appears to me, however, that those trapped in the hierarchicalism, legalism & rigorism repudiated by the Pope, likely lacked the theological imagination required to benevolently interpret it, precisely because the logical legacy of those -isms lead to fraught tautological terms, wherein one's conclusions are already embedded, and to invalid premises, fatally flawed by category errors, like conflations of moral & prudential judgments, or of divine & natural law with positive laws, church & public.  cont'd

That only happened in the late 70s/80s when (some) skinheads engaged in anti-establishment activities and were labeled as """"racists and anti-immigrant"""" by the pro-establishment tabloids in the UK.  Of course this led to stereotyping of skinheads as racists and ended up attracting fascists and neo-nazis to adopt skinhead attire and grooming and ultimately subverted the original intent.

I was present when a few members of the Alaska judiciary made racists comments and laughed about it in private, and other judges and attorneys who were present didn't bat eye about it.  Then those same judges a few weeks later made appallingly hypocritical comments (also in private) about how they believed Native Alaskans can be biased and prejudiced when they serve as jurors in their own community in trials involving outsiders.  Yes, racism is alive and well in the 21st century in Alaska.

0,"Facts don't really care whether they trivialize or exaggerate an issue, Mark. But when you want to call in resources outside the neighborhood to fight a fire, isn't it pretty important to provide accurate information about the magnitude of the problem?  Unlike """"social justice"""" theory, the Parable of The Good Samaritan was not told to address the problem of robbery and assault on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem. Jesus' point was not to raise awareness or get advocacy groups started. He was answering the question, """"Who is my neighbor?"""". And the answer seems quite clear to me. It is the person in need and hurt that we encounter on the pathways of our lives.  Jesus' life and teachings call us to self-sacrificing personal acts of love and mercy rather than self-empowering impersonal hand-wringing, seminars, advocacy and consciousness raising that provide moral thrills. Had Jesus suggested  a corporate policy/justice response to the situation, what would the impact have been?

For example, there is one woman who is homeless but is clean looking and sits at the same bus stop for hours but moves around just enough to not draw too much attention.

If you start from the premise that there is an overlap between being a cop and being a criminal (they are often cut from the same cloth)(""""every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints"""") perhaps universal quality child care (early learning and development) could be a long term strategy for preventing the kind of hyper-masculinity and the enabling code of silence which is making police culture toxic if it reduces risk factors in boys and teaches openness towards alternative problem solving techniques.  The cost savings here could be huge if you consider the Perry Preschool findings: of a total public benefit of $195K, the crime savings amounted to $171K.

Catechesis has gone on, as the history of the name implies, for a significant portion of Christian history, though generally by the bishop or through his auspices.  The Roman Catechism was much influenced by Aquinas', developed almost 350 years earlier.  The benefit of having both a Code of Canon Law and a catechism is that most people can read them for themselves, now.  Just as, prior to John West's publishing of case law, the US legal system was difficult to navigate and precedent difficult to find, so the canons used in various jurisdictions across the world were difficult to reconcile.  The catechism, also, is not the sum of the Catholic faith; it is its summary.

By explicitly nullifying UAAs bogus argument in the law the legislature are saving the UAA student and the taxpayer a whole bunch of money. UAA's lawyers must be pissed. They were probably giddy to ride this for as long as they could, money money money.

1,"Every day brings new evidence of the arrogance, ignorance, bigotry, corruption, incompetence and emotional/mental instability of the president. His latest calumny against President Obama is beyond the pale, not only because of the gravity of the lies he is telling but also, and precisely, because he is the president. It is beyond unconscionable that he persists in the lies even after they’ve been debunked by every investigative agency and body that has looked at them. Here is what he must do: 1.) He must fire Steve Bannon, Steve Miller and the cabal of neo-Nazis he brought into the White House. 2.) He must address the nation, and: a.) Apologize to President Obama for lying about him (again.) b.) Apologize to the people of the United States for lying to us, dividing us and diminishing us. c.) Apologize to the people of the world for eroding their confidence in the United States as a stabilizing force in the world. 3. He must resign.  If he does not resign, he must be impeached.

0,"The EU started as a free trade zone but has since morphed into the socialist quasi dictatorship we see today with an expensive bureaucracy with citizens of many countries feeling under-represented. The EU can impose immigration quotas,  environmental regulations and dictate the color of the wine produced by member countries,  over the heads of their citizens.  This lack of sovereignty created the push back we see in the UK and other countries. Countries that react emotionally (England) vote to leave. Pragmatic countries (Scotland) believe the EU needs to re-invent itself - a return to the original concept likely.  England's desire for a """"hard Brexit""""  means first minister Sturgeon has to navigate rocky waters to preserve Scotland's links to England and Europe. The marketplace will react to whatever the new reality is but a more gradual process is best. The voyage ahead is uncharted but with Sturgeon as captain a referendum at least gives Scotland a way to slow the  boat .

0,"Yes, that is correct. These fish were raised at a Cook Aquaculture ( a subsidiary of Icicle Seafoods Inc.) farm located in the San Juan Islands next to the border with Canada. As a result of the extreme high tides associated with the solar eclipse the net pen structure failed resulting in a loss of fish that were intended for the commercial market. My sources tell me approximately 10,000 escapees of a total 305,000 fish in the pens. To clarify, National Marine Fisheries Service raised and released yearly approximately (varied from year to year) 1 million Atlantic Salmon smolts in numerous Western Washington rivers to supplement the natural Steelhead production in the same rivers. The Boldt decision stated how many smolts were required in each river. These were and still are raised at the Manchester site near Bremerton Washington. Steelhead and Atlantic Salmon are the same but from different oceans and are different from Pacific salmon. Continued in a new message.............

He was also angry that Comey was focusing too much on the Russia connection and not the leaks (latter more important that a foreign entity interfering in U.S. democratic process apparently).  As the saying goes, if something doesnt make sense its probably untrue.  Another is the simplest explanation is the truth.  It seems more likely that the firing was a product of his rage.

Here, doctors are free to operate within the single payer system or outside of it. If they choose to operate outside, then they charge their patients directly and those patients are not reimbursed by the single payer system.  Further, doctors are paid by the system on a fee for service basis, and doctors associations (obviously powerful) negotiate those fees with the provincial governments (the actual single payers). It is entirely up to the doctor to earn more or less fees by how much they work, and it is entirely up to doctors to earn more or less my controlling their operating costs.  It is true that some Canadian doctors wanting greater capitalistic freedom, move to the US. But it is also true that most return to Canada, fed up with the administrative headaches of US practice.

THAT is the ONLY reality there is in this. Should they be forgiven? Absolutely. Should they be given a prison sentence? Absolutely -- a LONG ONE. Are the 'poor' pedophile priests victims of society? No, their brain is not operating on all four cylinders, and they were probably that way from birth. Plus, I don't care, I don't think the victims care, I don't think their parents care, and I sure don't think society cares about these poor victims of society.   And the minute we start with our bleeding hearts (for the poor victim priests, of course), then they go free or get a lighter sentence, and, once they are free, they will do it all over again.

The actual malice standard requires that the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case, if he is a """"public figure"""", prove that the publisher of the statement in question knew that the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.

0,"Before the financial conditions index, there was the monetary conditions index, which only included interest rates and exchange rates. Chuck Freedman says in a 1995 speech on the BoC’s now defunct MCI that the weighting of exchange rate changes in the index reflected empirical work that indicated “a 1 percentage point change in interest rates has about the same effect on aggregate demand over time as a 3 percent change in the exchange rate.” This rule of thumb was based on the C-6 index, which included the currencies of six of Canada’s major trading partners, not just the US, so the Canadian Effective Exchange Rate Index (CERI) would really be a better basis for the calculation than the US exchange rate. It was at 100.59 on July 28, up from 94.7 in June. This would be a 6.2% increase, equivalent to a two percentage point change in interest rates, by that rule of thumb.

Sloter was undrafted for a reason.  He played 1 year of college football at Greeley as QB.  There was literally very little to go on as far as evaluating Sloter. All we can go on is to compare Lynch and Sloter against the same players in training camp.  And based on that visual evidence and facts, most knowledgeable fans and experts could see that Sloter outplayed Lynch (against any equal, comparable competition). Lynch is reluctant to throw the ball even against 3rd and 4th stringers (he is gun shy and cannot read defenses).  At the very least, Sloter throws the ball.

0,"The last time I went to what was supposed to be the Canadian Museum of History I was struck by the fact that there is so little there about Canada. It starts with an immense entry hall which is all about natives. Then you progress into several more halls all about natives. You don't see much about white people until you go upstairs, and there's little enough of that. The dainty, delicate minds of our progressive history people think talking about white people is somehow declasse, because, after all, we're nothing more than invaders and oppressors.  The only reason to talk about us is to condemn us. So now we have a TV series that actually talks about Canadians instead of natives? Quelle Horreur! It doesn't focus on New France!? OMG! All I can say is most Canadians know virtually nothing of our history primarily due to the ideological zealots of the Left which grips the history departments in our universities.

Private timber supports very few mills and very few workers compared to the past, and pays far less for many low skill jobs than it did thirty years ago. Private timberlands have soil depleted of carbon, and their little pecker-poles sequester far less carbon than does mature forest with an understory, something that private forests discourage with toxic chemicals. Private timber operators bought public forest at below the cost of development and upkeep, and so their contribution to public coffers was a pittance.  And dead old trees still sequester carbon for centuries. Private forest practices deplete soil, silt up streams, kill fish, and the chemicals kill the insects and phytoplankton that fish feed on. Private logging roads cause landslides that strip steep slopes of topsoil that took a thousand years to develop. Private lands kill endangered wildlife. Private lands send Oregon dollars out of state.

0,"One does not need any resistant starch for a healthy microbiome. The Masai, for example, do quite well without any. Bacteria breaking down meat fibres and casein, for example, provide plenty of short-chain fatty acids for a healthy gut lining and blood brain barrier. Perhaps one needs resistant starch when eating lots of refined carbohydrates, which typically results in an overgrowth of sugar-eating bacteria, so resistant starch will help keep them from harming the gut lining once the initial surge of easily digested carbs wanes. Little is known as the science of the microbiome is very young and crude. Thus, the benefit of resistant starch in a high flour and sugar diet likely has no implications for a diet low in processed foods. To infer everyone needs resistant starch on the basis of a comparison within a very limited diet repeats the same types of errors that have plagued nutrition studies for over 50 years and results in continual flip-flops on almost every dietary recommendation.

What defenses can control is the number of 3 point attempts their opponents shoot.  In that regard, Oregon's opponents are putting up roughly a third of their FG attempts from three, and ~243 D1 schools are allowing more three point attempts (or 5 more P12 schools).   Programs like SMU, Syracuse, and Xavier are letting their opponents shoot 40% or more of their FG attempts from three (OSU is close to that group at almost 39%).  Certainly the Ducks can improve by reducing opponent 3 point attempts.  That should probably be the focus as opposed to whether or not a mediocre shooting team like Stanford happens to get hot on a Saturday in February.  Every team will have a hot shoot game eventually.  Even little Prairie View A&M, who shoots just 26.1% from deep, made 7 or 10 threes at Wisconsin in November.

0,"Poplak is a great wordsmith but this is badly argued. I am no academic economist, but I've read enough about Marx's theories (mainly Harvey) to know that Malikane's is flimsy on Marx. For starters, Marx thought it was absolutely essential for an economy to become thoroughly capitalist before it would collapse under the inherent contradictions he thought capitalism contained. And not any form of capitalism was enough. He thought an advanced form of it was essential. Marx drew a distinction between what he called primitive accumulation (he got this from Adam Smith), when people acquired (stole) public property and made it private - through say war - and accumulation. Advanced accumulation happens by using capital productively to create a profit. Marx thought this """"march of history"""" was inevitable - """"The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future"""".

Now, if the Obie project would promise that 10% of his rentals would be available for HACSA's Section 8 low income housing, that would be different. It would help the very poor. Lane County's Housing Authority needs to form partnerships with builders and the city, but this isn't a good project for HACSA residents. It feels like a deception to say that HACSA and Obie are in a partnership. If the city isn't getting taxes, why build the project? Just a reminder...there are seven HACSA Board members, and five of them are the Lane County Commissioners. I do wonder how that vote would go, would the commissioners not vote because of the conflict of interest, leaving the vote to the two resident members to vote? Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon

There are plenty of people who believe in the church and think that's what it means to believe in God. There are others who believe in a cause and pretend that's what it means to believe in God. And there are a growing number who act like God should believe in them and be grateful for the opportunity. I think the challenge for modern people is the same as it was for the people of Jesus' time: to make a leap of faith, believe in God, and hope in the resurrection. I think Lent is the time when the gospel challenges us to realize how far we have strayed from that faith, and to come back to God again.  We don't need more priests. We need more faith.

0,"Gary, Your call on the conversation but, just because you don't convince me to change my vote or me yours doesn't mean exploring each others thoughts, ideas, and reasons aren't worth the time. Regarding """"preferential voting"""" the Libertarian Party is already for it! If H or D should formally announce not only their support but action to make it happen, that could be something to cause Libertarians and Greens to align with whoever to get, see: http://lpar.org/2010/12/the-libertarian-alternative-types-of-voting/  Bernie didn't achieve anything with the democrats that I find worth achieving.  Somethings just the opposite.  Bernie had his chance, he will always be a footnote now and probably an ineffective senator as well.  Unless H gives him a cabinet job.  Like John McCain, Bernie is finished.  “Always vote for principle, though you may vote alone, and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost.” – John Quincy Adams

ICE has asked for permission to begin routinely destroying 11 kinds of records, including those related to sexual assaults, solitary confinement and even deaths of people in its custody.

We all know about recent scandals that show that Hillary is corrupt to the core ... in bed with Wall Street, a warmonger (5 wars under her watch ... that we know about), and can't be trusted with classified documents, but more, go read her book It Takes A Village.

Please note that I am very pro-EV.  In these years covering all sorts of start-ups (and failures) I have never seen anything like Arcimoto. They showed a prototype ten years ago and started taking deposits. There's absolutely no doubt that if it weren't for the name Frohnmayer and the private investor pockets that it's opened, this misadventure would have shut down years ago, as they have utterly failed in all this time to bring a viable product to market.  The EV market has profoundly matured since Arcimoto first showed its three-wheeler. One can buy very lightly used Nissan Leafs and other proper EVs for the $11,000 he's asking for his trike that has no real safety equipment, is not weather-proof, and is not really free-way compatible.  There are already  EV bikes and trikes already on the market.

But there has been a notable decline in equality for the next generation (now in their 20s and 30s) and a resulting significant decline in sexual satisfaction levels. Interestingly the younger generation reports that their mothers keep trying to advise them on how to have more fulfilling love lives and they keep responding :""""that's just not possible to do anymore"""". One thing the communists had done right was to teach men from the start that women are their equals in every way. That's not entirely universal of course. China had and has a far more patriarchal communism. But it was true in the East Bloc. The Soviet approach to socialism was fataly flawed in many ways. But they did do some things better.

0,"The real issue here to start with is calling tax cuts """"tax reform"""".  We'd all like to pay less taxes, but we all know things cost money.  Look at the recent articles about raising rates at  national parks.  They are raising them because there isn't the money in the budget for their maintenance. Across the board things are poorly funded, and we are running a deficit.  Its not going to change because no matter what they cut because they want to raise something else, military spending for example.  Now we are talking about cutting revenue and dreaming that it will turn the world around by the very fact that we are cutting revenue.  People sometimes break their support up by social vs fiscal issues.  Socially liberal vs fiscally conservative for example.  Republicans have replaced fiscally conservative with """"lets just throw money in the sky and see where it lands.""""

0,"Well, your reference to rationality is intriguing. Rational people can actually read and understand other people's comments, and not take words and concepts haphazardly out of context, fuse them into an anachronistic, disjointed collage masquerading as an argument (not even remotely agreeing with the speaker's intention) that they then 'generously' attribute to the speaker just to be able to attack the speaker, not his/her argument, to prove their ideologically preconceived dogmatic position.  Fear is caused by lack of rational thinking, such as this; when due to ideological considerations (for example, political correctness) the other person is deprived from the basic respect that he or she is deserves by being listened to and understood properly, and not to mention responded to fairly and justly. It is these ideological limitations that undermine trust and respect, and prevent any rational interaction, creating fear and hate, and ultimately, destroying the fabric of society itself.

The problem has less to do with GOALS and more to do with STRATEGIES.  They overinvest in the hard powers of rhetorical confrontation and political & legal COERCION at the expense of such soft powers as dialogical engagement, formative spirituality and moral enculturation, in other words, evangelical PERSUASION.  More fundamentally, their social justice teachings find more traction in both the lives of the faithful and the public square because the moral methodology stands on firmer anthropological ground with its robust personalism & relationality - responsibility model. Their teachings regarding gender, sex & personal morality suffer from an impoverished natural law philosophy, which lacks the personalist insights. Thus lacking persuasive influence, they're going to draw a different level & type of attention fr faithful & in the public square.

Some knowledge of firearms history would have you informed of the fact that semi-automatic functioning predates the end of the 19th century, and was used primarily in hunting and sporting firearms for decades before it’s widespread use by the military, when the M1 Garand was adopted as the primary battle rifle of the military.

0,"While the 4 to 1 vote in favour of Brexit at Westminster yesterday went virtually unnoticed by the Globe it was widely felt across Europe. Marine Le Pen has vowed to hold a Frexit referendum. Anti EU sentiment has been on the rise in Europe, accelerated by Frau Merkel's unilateral decision to invite the middle east and North Africa to move in. Yesterday's vote and the likelihood of Commons final approval next week adds fuel.  Four years of Hollande's shambolic neo-Marxist government and France's sclerotic economy are the main drivers of Le Pen's rise. The truck massacre in Nice heightened concern over the problem of radical Islam in France, with one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe. After decades of open migration Mme Le Pen's immigration stance is considered rational and not dissimilar with Britain's policies. Mme Le Pen has largely defanged the NF to where it more resembles the UK Tories. And this worries the chattering class with their plans for greater centralization.

Did you follow the directions, or just follow your feelings on how you wanted things to work given your emotions?  How did that work out for you?  The compatibility of the male and female genitals does certainly include shape, but it also includes things like compatible excretion glans, aligned nerve centers, where things fit together and this correct fit is designed to cause mutual pleasure simultaneously as part of their compatibility.   Without getting too graphic, this is part of the beauty of male and female sexual compatibility.    This mutual working together is inherent in their function, not secondary.   When homosexuals engage in mutual masturbation, this same type of complementarity is absent.    They often have to involve many extra devices, lubrications and methods to try to simulate what is inherent in the sexual coupling of a man and woman.

When I called and wrote them, asking why did they not ask first for equal ordination for all people, as a matter of human justice, and then optional celibacy for all priests, they have repeatedly answered me back that they had voted on this issue and barely got half of their group to support women being ordained deacons.  There was no way they could get more than half to support equal ordination for women, starting with priesthood.  Basically, there are many ex-priests in this group due to their breaking their vows and marrying, and they just care about themselves.  Big surprise.  So I suggest these guys won't make very good priests until they understand that women are human beings too and that the bias against women is sin.

0,"Many black families find themselves in poorer neighborhoods because they did not receive the same opportunities as whites did due to explicitly racist policies. When racist policies were in place a poor white family was afforded greater privilege than a poor black family was. Hence the white privilege. This has a compounding effect: a white family is allowed a loan which allows them to buy a house, hence increasing their wealth. This increases their property value which improves the school in their neighborhood. Now their children have a better education which affords them better opportunities, etc.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_discrimination_(United_States)  So tell me how whites, today, do not benefit from racial policies in the past and I'll give up the idea that white privilege is a thing. Until then, I'll continue on working to bridge the opportunity gap and understand that through no fault of my own I have things a little easier.

0,"Obviously hard to tell from the limited disclosure in the article, but this looks like a very good deal for the Caisse. They have $2.6 billion in government equity behind their preferred return of capital and 8% return. In other words, the project has to be a 50% write-off before they lose money (more if there are the inevitable overruns) but they get an 8% return on their initial equity and overrun equity, plus 50% of the upside, even though they have the preferred return. It is somewhat unclear how this differs from the governments borrowing at 8% and arranging an overrun facility at the same rate.  Little likely downside risk, a good return above long run stock market expectations and the possibility of upside.  We would all likely take that bet. Maybe this is the type of thing that the Infrastructure Bank wants to do, but I don't see any real risk transference here.

1,"It is time. America.  It is time for racist America to accept responsibility and be held accountable for creating a despicable racist monster as Donald Trump. The key to Trump’s rise to power is America’s pride of its slave days and the wanton killing of Native Americans of the American West.  What we see and experience today is part of that legacy.  There is no other explanation. That legacy is here in Anchorage with the wanton killings of Native people  on our streets, run down like animals and left to die. It is in our cities by rogue hate cops killing black and brown people at will.  Donald Trump, with all of his hate and bigotry, from his “hate Obama is not an American birther” days to his kick all 11-million Hispanics out, is your creation. I can only conclude that might include some of my Hispanic family.  And the white media? They all smile and laugh about Trump like high-school kids watching a school-yard bully.

It's a cultural thing, really; I just don't dig it, same as I didn't dig the crusty old mutant conservative villagers in Switzerland when I lived there. Same as you probably wouldn't dig the company of Amish farmers.  The native Portland white is for the most part a mellow guy who doesn't like confrontation or violence and feels uncomfortable, even disgusted, by garish displays of macho posturing. Knowing that what we regard as civility is considered “pussy” by African Americans who come here with Big Bad Cali/East Coast attitudes simply adds insult to injury. Maybe if you'd holster your iron and let us get to know you and not the strutting rooster you'd be pleasantly surprised at how accepting we are.

In my case I am mostly interested in how the media portrays Trump, but also how he is intentionally or unintentionally questioning so much of conventional political speak, culture and modus operandi of the political class.  I think the response to Trump has been far more interesting and revealing than Trump himself...but then again, you seem to have decided to already settle on the boring caricature painted by the media and talking class.

0,"Ancient practice in Jerusalem! Remember the Church has different rites, in the Roman rite receiving has been done differently so it is false to call it a liturgical aberration. Likewise in the other various rites, like in the liturgy of St. Chrysostom where a spoon is used are they in error as well? In the Roman rite according to Saint Eutichiano, St. Leo and St. Gregory it is on the tongue.  It should also be mentioned that the mystagogical catechesis were five lectures of cyril that were separate from the others, and have only recently been collected as one work, some assume that the 5 mystagogal lectures were meant for the soon to be ordained.  St. Basil outlines that communion in hand is permissible in times of persecution or ascetics in the desert.  Personally what I think is important is reverence, regardless of method. Few people practice what is described as receiving a king.

The residential schools were not a successful experiment but were well-intentioned because teaching native children to speak English and was the only possible way to help them cope with the modern world. After we abandoned that approach Pierre Trudeau suggested a different approach: abolish the Indian Act and give native people the same rights as all other Canadians. All the native elites howled and screamed in response and Pierre Trudeau backed down. So what next? """"Aboriginal self-government"""" is a non-starter unless all the indigenous people are moved into one province (Manitoba?) which would become a gigantic reserve. Rewriting our history to pretend that Canada has existed for thousands of years is total nonsense and helps no one.

0,"""""The ‘Overton window’ is a term from political science meaning the acceptable range of political thought in a culture at a given moment. It was the creation of Joseph Overton, a think-tank intellectual based in Michigan, who died in 2003 at 43 after a solo plane accident. His crucial insight, one which both emerged from and was central to the work of the think tank Right, was that the window of acceptability can be moved. An idea can start far outside the political mainstream – flat taxes, abolish the IRS, more guns in schools, building a beautiful wall and making Mexico pay – but once it has been stated and argued for, framed and restated, it becomes thinkable. It crosses over from the fringe of right-wing think-tankery to journalistic fellow-travellers; then it crosses over to the fringe of electoral politics; then it becomes a thing people start seriously advocating as a possible policy. The window has moved, and rough beasts come slouching through it to be born."""" —John Lanchester

When you have too damn many people in the race, you run the risk of the mainstream candidates diluting each other and allowing someone with only a third of actual party support become the nominee.  A Senate seat that we probably would have won got pissed away the moment Daryl Glenn won the primary with just 37%.  The same thing would have happened with Trump had Hillary proven not to be even worse.  And Trump did have one big thing going for him -- he wasn't a politician.  And much of the country was (is) so sick of politicians that they were willing to hold their noses and look past Trump's other disagreeable qualities.

0,"I just love it when some little darling from the suburbs complains that other people aren't subsidizing his driving addiction adequately. So-called user fees (gas taxes, registrations, tolls and such) pay for less than 45% of road building and maintenance, and none of the other costs (policing, ambulance, medical). The rest comes from general taxes, effectively a subsidy for those with intense driving habits.  It is nice to see a few people on this board actually call for some increases in the gas tax. Bear in mind that in order for motorists to pay their own way, it will have to go up quite a bit (dollars, not cents). In fact, it will have to go up enough to convince many of our suburban neighbors to find ways to get their stuff done without always turning on their cars.  Meanwhile, others want to further starve the beast in the hope that if the state has less money it will work better. I don't believe I will ever understand such reasoning, but it's a commonly held position.

The most notorious is Maui Senator Roz Baker who has repeatedly killed pesticide reporting and buffer zone bills in previous sessions even though she heads the committee responsible for protecting consumers and public health.  The time to act on this is long past due. Baker and other opponants need to be called out.  In opposing the Maui county ordinance, Baker insisted it was the state's kuleana to provide safeguards, but since then she has done nothing.  She apparently does not care about people getting sick from neurotoxins. Roz has a state-funded cadillac health plan for life, but many of us can't afford to get sick or disabled and our children's brains are at risk.  Pass these bills.

0,"Universities should only accept students into PhD programs if they can properly fund them. In the sciences this is generally not a problem, since faculty members will have large research grants. In the humanities funding is harder to come by and admission should be restricted accordingly.  Too many PhD programs, especially outside the sciences, are there to serve the ambitions of faculty members and not the needs of society. In such cases, students may be admitted simply to fill the program ranks, without much regard to their potential, the funding available, or the job market they will face. It is easy to see that foreign students accepted under these conditions may end up feeling duped.  This is not to say that there aren't excellent foreign PhD students. I see no reason to favour Canadian PhD applicants. Most foreigners receiving PhD's in Canada stay here, just as Canadians educated in the US tend to stay there. The only criterion for admission should be individual excellence

The second is to have mounted a campaign for the Republican nomination and then for the presidency. Both require considerable organizational and interpersonal skills.  In contrast, what has O'Leary accomplished? He had ownership a long time ago for a short time of a toy company that disintegrated shortly after he was lucky enough to unload it on a major. Since then he has done little other than use his very big mouth to promote himself.  Both he and Trump lack a grounding in their countries' public affairs and in global affairs. Trump, with some pratfalls is managing to assemble a capable cabinet because he knows that he needs competent and self-assured people around him. Picture O'Leary!

Canada would be better off taking a more holistic view to racism and seeing it as part and parcel of many cultures, and to stop fixating on white European cultures and people.

Some would do almost anything to get their next fix, but many also wouldn't.  There are degrees of addiction. When we incarcerate an addict we take one more customer away from the drug dealers.  We take a potential shop-lifter, store robber or car thief out of business. More than that, the first victim of drugs, the user,  is in a much safer place where they can withdraw and take stock of their life, perhaps for the first time. . You are right, a drug addict has to 'want' to clean up.  If they don't, no amount of treatment or jail will work. In the meantime if they break the law the rest of society has some  things they 'want' as well and should have. One of them is safer streets with  less fear of  'desperate' addicts on the prowl.  I don't believe any drug user has a right to take that away from anyone else.

But he was right. We pulled out and within 18 months ISIS was taking the place over. Shoot I remember thinking give it 5 years, and it happened even faster than I guessed it would.  It didn't matter if we thought it was right or wrong for going into Iraq. Didn't matter. But once we were there we should have seen it through--by that ensuring we have a strong, U.S. friendly government in place there, and even then withdraw only very slowly, over decades if needed. But we seem incapable of seeing anything through for longer than the term of a president.

It seems the suspect was arrested by a road Sgt. for driving without a valid license.  Incensed, the suspect ran down into the sub-basement garage of the PD at shift change and shot and killed the Sgt. with one shot to the head.  Other officers present in the sub-basement garage returned fire killing the suspect.  The autopsy stated, """"results show the suspect died when struck with over 50 rounds of return fire from other Officers after the suspect shot and killed an unsuspecting Sgt. in his squad car.""""  At the time I was employed as an Investigator-Sgt and admit that except for the death of the Sgt. in the report I very much enjoyed reading of the ending to the story.  Quite frankly, it's too bad this story didn't have a similar story.  Recidivism from Sex offenders is the highest of all criminals.

Each student had his/her own unique schedule, so social cliques didn't form readily.

0,"Bingo! You are exactly correct. I would also add that many of these doctors are not true small businesses. As the Ontario Health Minister and others have correctly pointed out, many doctors work at hospitals or walk in clinics owned by other entities. They are therefore simply employees of that facility. They have zero overhead, they don't employ a single person, they are paid from the public purse. How they can claim they are a small business and enjoy a 10.5% income tax rate is beyond comprehension! This is the biggest scam perpetrated on the largely unwitting and unknowing Canadian taxpayer in history. The government continues to keep this totally unfair scheme in place and that is the REAL story here folks. But the media and government do not make that known to the public to a large degree. At the very minimum, there should be a rule that defines a small business as any entity that employs at least 3 people like Quebec did as a requirement to incorporate.

It means, in spite of having a top notch setter, returners at middle and one side, and back row, and a whole bunch of returning reserves, not many coaches think UH has much fire power. It means not many coaches think UH had quality recruits - which seems pretty obvious when the words out of the mouth of the new coach is """"they'll need a year or two..."""". Now, you can't build a quality program if your freshmen recruits needs seasoning, not good enough to step right in. That's what happens when the old coach doles out assistant positions to old time friends or their kids like doling out candy.

If they piss off government union workers that may lead to the NDP being more popular in Edmonton but will not impact the Conservative's election chances.

Maybe the very secure English bishops are attempting to push their less secure, more fearful or fainthearted counterparts in, say, Brazil to move forward in regard to ordaining married men. Security sometimes provides a greater magnifying glass than insecurity. Of all the Roman/Latin Catholic religious communities in the world, the English Catholic Church knows best -- sees best -- how successful married Catholic priests function in parochial ministry. When I was in UK this past January, a Catholic cleric told me that in some areas nearly 10% of the Catholic priests in UK are married (former Anglicans). And they are doing just fine, too -- accepted by the laity. Still, most National Bishops' Conferences are hesitant to more forward on this issue/this need. There has to be a reason for this, of course. (And they can't blame the pope.)

After all audits, Tides received CRA approval to continue as a registered charity.  Whether investing in a charitable project or an industry, it is always important to ensure the funds are legitimate, not the laundered proceeds of crime.  We have to remember the Canadian government invites all organizations to apply for funding from elsewhere. Since industry can solicit foreign investors, so can charities, but they are frequently the targets for CRA audits. As long as they pass those audits, they really can't be accused of having hidden funds. The CRA should pursue secretive off-shore accounts with such zeal.

If this investigation were to unearth evidence, for instance, that called into question Trump's conduct, whether post Jan 20th or en route to his becoming POTUS, surely those findings would reverberate down the line, possibly with implications for his actions while in office (executive orders, nominations, etc.).  While I'm not well versed on the legal arguments, it seems to me that the Gorsuch nomination could, in the above scenario, be construed as a kind of fruit of the poisonous tree. I’d be interested to hear more about precedent on this.  Hence, the idea of postponement.

0,"In most couples the women do more housework. Not all (for example, my wife is a slob). In some couples both people are slobs, and in some they're both neat-freaks. So a better way to look at it is:  1) In most couples, one person does more housework than the other (typically the woman). 2) The person who does less housework usually doesn't regard this as a problem, because they A) don't value housework, or B) they're lazy.  Instead of turning this into a gender issue, it's better to look at it as a difference in values between partners. Compromise is probably necessary. And at the most basic level, a schedule of chores to get the minimum agreed-on housework done.

You failed to understand Russia, Michael Morell."""" http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/russia-extends-snowden-asylum-slams-tip-present-him-gift-trump/ri18587 Michael Morell (probably much like the CIA, itself) is obviously a person without any sense of human decency, and who gives no value to the protecting of  human-rights defenders, or those in need of help. With the CIA's history, I wonder how it's possible for anyone to work there and still be decent.

I scratch my head at the hierarchs who thought fighting is was an acceptable idea and those of their fans who still can't get behind it. The gist of both the recent and Dignitas is saying, like Roe, that supporting rule by Catholic mob is no longer a requrement of the faith. Just the opposite because it violates the dignity of the individual. All the stuff Aquinas wrote about free will. Marry it to the enlightenment and you have Dignitas Jesus did not come to make us slaves to himself or to the leaders of the Church.

It's wrong to deny a religious school shredded tires for a playground. It's quite another to say taxpayers have to fund religious education. """"We must have vouchers for poor folks"""" is a sham argument, anyway. The voucher supporters want tax money so that middle class parents can use the voucher money plus their own funds to go to high-end private schools, just like the rich folks do. Voucher supporters want to gut funding of public schools. If screaming """"bigotry!"""" gets them there, they'll use it. Colorado provides for a system of free public education. Taxpayers even fund magnet schools and charter schools for parents who do not want their children to attend regular public schools. If parents want to go to religious private schools, let them pay their own way. Or teach their children their religion at home.
