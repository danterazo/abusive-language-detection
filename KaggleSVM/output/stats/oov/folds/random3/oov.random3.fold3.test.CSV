0,"My guess is, Carrington and Freeman will declare for the NFL draft; I'd be surprised if they didn't. If they return, though, they should carry a """"Loss of Value"""" insurance policy, which Ifo Ekpre-Olomu had. He collected $3 million on the policy, the highest amount ever paid out to a college player. After tearing his ACL, Olomu's 2015 draft spot fell from the projected 1st round to the 7th round, where he was the 241st overall pick.  As for other Ducks profiled above (and still other players who could transfer), I was disappointed this season by Taj Griffin. I didn't expect another DeAnthony Thomas, but I expected more given his talent. Ducks don't have any QB recruits in the 2017 class, so keeping Jonsen and Wilson even as back-ups is necessary. Defensive linemen and linebackers are a high priority; Ducks have a few in the 2017 class. They may need to go to the JC ranks to get a few more; I have concerns about Prevot and Heard returning given Taggart's strong comments about character.

0,"From the article, explaining why ATF cannot just reverse itself: Curbelo said Tuesday that administrative action alone would not solve the issue, noting that ATF has previously ruled that the devices should not be regulated like machine guns. “If they were to get sued after changing that interpretation, the plaintiffs would have a very strong case given the agency’s previous determinations,”

0,"After 2 years working on a documentary about the homeless –forgive the plug but you can see it with a donation to IHS at NoRoomInParadise.com- I saw first hand the impact of poverty in Hawaii.  On the basis of the federal supplemental poverty measure there are 229,000 people living in poverty in Hawaii.  Most of them working full time.  At minimum wage, $8.50 an hour, 40 hours a week that brings them just $1360 a month before FICA taxes are deducted from their pay packet.  How many people are just a step or two above this level?  If Republicans could ever get their act together and make a serious appeal to this large pool of economically disenfranchised people, the Democratic party here would be in serious trouble.  As an environmentalist – given the GOPs disregard for climate science- I find that alarming.  One way to fight back against the Trump victory is for the progressive movement to unite now behind a campaign to immediately raise the minimum wage to $15 in Hawaii.

0,"Layla that may be something that should be looked at.  If a spouse stays home then the non-working spouse should be paid for staying home from the income of the working spouse and pay both the employer/employee share of the CPP.  However, with todays tax rules it isn't really possible. This Gov't won't tackle an issue like that.  They like to assume everyone is out working.  They also don't want to think about those that aren't earning anything and not paying any deductions.

And now they come with this bull/s#$t. I clearly recall them saying that the 10 year pursuit of King and their declarations was because it was in the public interest - and they wanted to make an example to other tax defrauders. Well we can all guess that the Gupta's took that plight and scoffed at it all knowing that Tom and Jerry at SARS will look the other way - and in fact Tombooi personally ensure that they got their R70m VAT REFUND.

0,"Its real simple: Don't oversell!  When I purchase a non-refundable airline ticket months in advance, I should reasonably expect to have a seat on the plane on the appointed day. Presumably if someone does not show up, they forfeit their airfare. How does that inconvenience the Airline?  I don't want to spend hundreds of non-refundable dollars for a seat that I MIGHT get after I have driven to the airport the night before, booked a hotel, paid for dinner, paid for longterm parking, waited 2 hours to clear security in order to fly somewhere or make a connection or take a cruise the next day. By denying me the secure knowledge that I have a seat on the flight I have booked, you potentially put thousands of my dollars at risk.  So its real simple - don't oversell. And don't qualify your apology. Make a commitment here and now that you will discontinue the practice of overselling. Its real simple. If you can't figure that out, you should resign!

0,"""""Giving more to “rich” people results in it being stored away in the bank."""" - Mark Hoffman  But what happens to that money stored away in the bank?  Is it just sitting there as gold bars?  No. It's being loaned out to small businesses, allowing them to grow, increasing their employee base. It's being loaned out to homeowners, who by purchasing a new home have given trades a job. That money does not sit idle; it works to improve our economy. And not all of that largesse 'the rich' get goes to banks. Some is directly invested in corporate stocks & bonds, funding industrial growth. Some of it even goes for purchases, luxury or otherwise, which in turn require labor for manufacturing & distribution. So the next time you think tax breaks are wasted on 'the rich', think again.  I remember when they raised the tax on luxury boats. It was the middle class boat builders who got hurt; not 'the rich'.

He thinks that will make him popular.  And popularity is so necessary to someone who is internally vacuous.   Because of Trump's spite the courts will grant rights and it will cost more in time and money than if he'd just stuck with the promise he made when campaigning  The White House recently announced that President Trump continues to be respectful and supportive of L.G.B.T.Q. rights, just as he was throughout the election.  They said Trump is proud to have been the first ever G.O.P. nominee to mention the L.G.B.T.Q. community in his nomination acceptance speech, and he pledged to provide protections for the community  As with every other promise Trump has ever made, exercising his most dominant trait, he lied about his intentions, and he failed to follow through on his promise.

0,"As I said you really should read more. BMI was and is a basic basic tool to measure obesity. The underlying problem with the BMI index is that it can't distinguish between fat and muscle. Being overweight can be an indicator of underlying health problems either now , or in the future, but it can never be used to categorically say that you are healthy. The study or paper published by Hackett never received widespread acclaim as it simply wasn't the complete picture. Interestingly enough he published a number of papers on infectious diseases among aboriginals, TB being one of the more prevalent. You have a computer use it to actually look up a variety of opinions that are current. Taking one study has been always considered as a extremely poor way to make a point, as it is so easily refuted. Again do some research, instead of taking the lazy way out.

0,"There is only one long term solution to this problem - flood the market with supply.  Toronto and the Federal government need to get moving right away on the port lands.  Make land available and get developers to compete for the most beneficial solution with high density, mixed rents including low rent units, architectural quality and mixed use being criteria of importance. Build high density in the Portlands where there are currently little or no next door neighbours to complain about high rises ruining their neighbourhood.  Start from the centre and move out toward the lake / harbour front.  The highest value lands will be the last to be developed and can be lower rise.  Once the high rises start rising up build the transit starting with streetcar extension.  Keep cars out of this area - no condo or rental parking  - it will be too high density to ever work when fully built-out.

I don't like Mr. Parry's column, but he is basically saying what every other defense attorney would say, """"Do NOT volunteer information or answer questions without an attorney present."""" There is no obligation to answer questions from the police or prosecutors. Further, if you do so, """"anything you say may be used against you"""". No one is obligated to prove their innocence to police or prosecutors. It is up to police or prosecutors to show there is enough evidence to prosecute someone for a crime. If someone wants to co-operate with the police or prosecutors, they should do so with their eyes wide open.

0,"The Sunshine List is, as Harris intended it to be, a meaningless distraction.  At very least, what you would want to know is whether the total of all publicly funded salaries, adjusted for inflation, have been growing. Remember, responsibility for various services have been uploaded and downloaded over the last twenty years.  You might also want to compare how much we are paying for services that have been privatized.  (Nothing, you say? We'll, that assumes you don't use those services.  This is unlikely).  And you might want to add in the cost of benefits paid to people getting public salaries.  You also might be curious enough to compare the income distribution in public salaries.  Have they over the last twenty years been making the rich richer and lower paid employees less so - you know, like the private sector. I don't have the answers to these questions but I bet more a few economists out there do.

Looking at Taylor's charges, particularly the kidnapping charge makes me wonder if these kids should be in contact with their mom. I feel bad for these children, how awful to grow up with a parent in prison. So many children of inmates grow up to follow their parents into jail. PI has a valid point, we need to make sure we don't take our anger at the parents out on the children. Spenard, I'm being realistic, I don't think there is anything wrong questioning the parenting skills of inmates. The very fact they are in prison is a valid point in wondering if these children are in age environments and would they be safe to be around them when the parent gets out. A kidnapper is not a most likely not suitable parent in my opinion. Serving time in prison doesn't erase the severity of the crime. Prayers for these children, I wish them all the best.

Second, by law (HRS 327C-1), death may be declared by a physician, osteopath, or nurse. Any of those may be providing care preceding death, even if they are not affiliated with a hospice entity.  If family or other caregivers follow the advice given here, they risk inviting an unnecessary, aggressive, and sometimes violent medical intervention.

She also mentioned the “carryover” of unspent funds from prior years.  It’s about 25.9%, and while it includes some restricted funds, it represents the city’s 2nd largest source of “revenue” (behind RPT).  Other revenues from fees and taxes also increased over the six-year period of projections she was looking at.  One other thing to note is that the city had included some rail costs in 2019, but it wasn’t clear whether there was matching revenue.  (Responses to her questions weren’t real clear either.)  Since the costs were included, either there’s a revenue source to cover them, or the city was irresponsible (her word) for including them in the projection.

I've never really understood the arguments against a secure border, as that does not mean we no longer accept immigrants.  For all the fuss, we still accept more than anybody else.  We have border crossings that work (though idle open to more if that would help traffic.). Let the las work.

0,"So if and when it is determined that terrorists of the Muslim kind have committed this act (surprise, surprise), what do you propose we do? Your xenophobic red herring argument overlooks the fact that a Muslim can be of any race. The fact is, Islamic theology and doctrine; not race, drive Muslim terrorists to commit mayhem and murder. The more devout a Muslim becomes, the more likely it is that he/she is to commit terrorism. The problem is, no one can hazard a guess when a Muslim individual decides to become more devout and so a """"moderate"""" Muslim who appears peaceful always has the potential to commit terrorist acts - if he/she decides to follow the dictates of the Koran.

Yup - there are people leaving town and the biggest reason they cite is the cost of housing. Cost of housing and lots of supply in the pipeline are about to meet demand in the typical Colorado boom and bust. Every millennial I know is living paycheck to paycheck - and eventually they are going to get tired of that lifestyle. Most cannot envision a day when they will be able to buy a house. I can relate - I moved to Denver from Boston many years ago because after graduating from college I didn't think I would ever be able to afford a home there - but I was able to buy one the day I arrived in Colorado.

Increasing supply does not address the negative socio-economic effects of such price escalation caused by out of towners who aren't paying income tax yet cause huge negative effects.  The lack of regulation is cowardice and fear (housing development being the largest part of the lower mainland's economy and bizarrely having been allowed to hyperinflate and climb to huge proportions of the Canadian economy since 2010 therefore a huge risk).  The only solution that protects taxpayers is regulation and enforcement: a ban on out of town ownership (the legislative structure is already applied in a place like Banff), or a 100% tax like Bermuda, full crackdown on non-reporting of incomes or claims of housewives/students to be in poverty while living in a mansion.

The Gospel is the remedy offered for our misunderstanding God and being unable to obey Him. (One may add that the Godhead is beyond gender differentiation.) It appears to me that the Church is struggling with whether it is God or about God. If we are to get to know our loving creator and worship in spirit and truth we must grow beyond an  infantile religious narcissism that takes the appearance of institutional forms for the transcendent. It is likely this will come to pass. In the meantime in a culture of group-speak it may be difficult to do the hard work of critical thinking.

It is this ideology that requires that women wear Burkas. Hillary Clinton recognized this as she said in her speech after the Orlando massacres;  """"For starters, it is long past time for the Saudis, the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations. And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism""""  Accordingly, another reason Canadians may be against Burkas is the link of Burkas to the radical ideology of the Wahhabis, which according to a Wahhabi Imam, is similar to that of ISIS, per a recent article.

Even w/o the labor agreement issues, the federal Fair Labor Standards Act drives much of the overtime entitlement, and the FLSA makes scheduling of 24/7 operations very difficult and expensive.   It takes very aggressive management to make 24 hour operations work at all economically, and unfortunately many public sector managers aren't managers but rather co-conspirators.   It has been 30 yrs. since the USSC put public employers under the FLSA, and employers still haven't adequately adapted to it or made meaningful efforts to change it to accommodate government operations.

Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.  Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.  Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.  Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.  Blessed are they who bear arms: for they shall be called the children of death.  Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.  (The veracity of this “King Jones” version has been questioned.)

""""Temples of your love""""is the goal, not our current state.  The Holy Spirit is invoked in Eucharistic Prayers east and west for the epiclesis, the making of bread and wine into the Body and Blood, and nothing else.  In addition, we ask the Father to make us (we aren't made yet) worthy to enter heaven, and to fill us with the Holy Spirit.  And we ask this through the merit of his Son, not our own worthiness.

0,"With 22 million more Americans left uninsured as a result of the GOP Senate's version of their health care bill, according to the CBO, and profoundly reducing Medicaid benefits in the years ahead, this legislation looks terminal. A health care bill in which participation is not universal, important funding to support it is relinquished by excluding tax revenue and where states can change the terms of insurance with little substantiation will leave many without coverage. Those who would most suffer are those needing extended care such as the elderly. Although the Republican-controlled Senate's bill may be a little less onerous than the House version, the end result overall means greatly reduced benefits for the most vulnerable among us. This new version of the GOP's replacement of Obamacare, a fundamental campaign promise of President Trump, still appears to be a cure lacking a disease.

0,"The Executive Order required the travel ban during a 90-day period when the Visa program is reviewed and updated. The review could require additional information for Visa applicants. The Hawaii Court then prohibited both the travel ban and the review of the Visa program. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals then overturned the restriction on reviewing the Visa program.  So the review can be started, while the temporary travel ban from the six countries is in place.  After the update of the Visa program, opponents could file lawsuits against any added Visa application requirements. Therefore, the Supreme Court case on the President's powers will still be important after the 90-day period has passed.  The revised Executive Order allowed case-by-case waivers granted during the Visa processing for work, study, visiting or residing with close family members, urgent medical care, etc. The Supreme Court ruling has made the waivers mandatory in certain cases.

In 1994, Crimea's independence and pro-Russia movement was growing, and Crimea formed a separatist government. the UN polled Crimea quarterly from 2009 - 2011, and each time found that a majority of Crimean residents wanted to rejoin Russia. In 2014, around the time of the Maiden coup in Kiev, and pre-referendum in Crimea, various international pollsters found that nearly 80% of polled Crimean residents wanted to rejoin Russia. Post Crimean referendum, many international pollsters investigated the satisfaction of Crimeans with the referendum outcome, and typically found that over 85% of Crimeans were fully satisfied with the referendum outcome, while further Crimeans were mostly or generally satisfied with the 2014 Crimean referendum outcome. The polling of Crimea is consistent and clear.

0,"A “preferential option for the poor” should be maintained in our Catholic Schools. If we find that we cannot afford to keep our schools open to the poor, the schools should be closed and the resources used for something else which can be kept open to the poor. We cannot allow our Church to become a church primarily for the middle-class and rich while throwing a bone to the poor. The priority should be given to the poor even if we have to let the middle-class and rich fend for themselves. Practically speaking, the Catholic Schools must close and the resources used for “Confraternity of Christian Doctrine” and other programs which can be kept open to the poor. Remember, the Church managed without Catholic Schools for centuries. We can get along without them today. The essential factor is to cultivate enough Faith to act in the Gospel Tradition, namely, THE POOR GET PRIORITY. The rich and middle-class are welcome too. But the poor come first.

We also have many communities where there are no problems and I'm proud of the Unity March in Anchorage. Many of the protesters I saw in videos of Baton Rouge were white.

Since atomic or bacteriological weapons have not been used in Syria, lets not throw a red herring out to divert the the fact that these other news sources concurred with Fox News that Assad had & used chemical weapons.  The fact that this is not the 1st time Assad used chemical weapons, should have been a wake-up call to Putin.  According to the Moscow Times,  extremely embarrassing to Putin.  Not a smart move to publicly  embarrass a ex-KGB officer who is in charge of Russia.

0,"Mr.Magana Ortiz may be a great guy but he still is a illegal immigrant who lied and perhaps falsified documents to remain living in the United States. My question to Tulsi Gabbard is Why does Hawaii owe Mr. Magan Ortiz a debt for his contributions ? What contributions did he make that warrant this community acknowledgment and appreciation ? He did no public service for our community and his contributions to the coffee industry was part of his economic survival. I don't think that Hawaii owes him anything. Gabarrd is making this guy so special for political reasons only. She loves the attention. I do however think that Mr. Magana Ortiz should be given a opportunity to stay in the United States given his current situation provided the is held accountable for his past actions. No Rep. Gabbard, Mr. Magana Ortiz did not pay us back in full just because he became entrepreneur.

0,"Once again an article that encourages an increase in GDP but does not mention the fact that a change in GDP does not change living conditions. And living conditions should surely be our concern. And an increase in GDP suggests an increase in pollution.  There is correlation between inequality of income (top 20% versus bottom 20% of work force) and living conditions. The lower the inequality the better the living conditions. This holds across 22 nations so it is well worth pursuing income inequality rather than GDP.  The most interesting while being controversial is Japan. A basket case economically and tied with Sweden as the best place to live. Both countries, especially Japan, have relatively homogeneous populations.  Pursuing income inequality seems like a good idea. Everyone gains since living conditions improve.

0,"Who's more likely and has more incentive to sell pot to kids: criminals on the black market or a heavily regulated industry?  Your experience might be different, but when I was growing up it was a lot easier to get pot than it was to get alcohol or cigarettes.  These ideas that legalization and regulation somehow leads to MORE crime and MORE abuse by children is completely unfounded. It is precisely these reasons that I want to see it legalized and regulated. I'd rather isolate the problem to a few people who abuse it rather than throw in danger to children, black market crime, and gangs. I'd like to see the police focusing on bigger issues. Pot, compared to hard drugs, is minor - not to mention how much better it is for pain management and a variety of other uses.  If my father didn't have pot to manage his pain he'd go back to opioids and die. I'd rather see adults use it recreationally over children. I know you mean well, but I don't agree with your approach. Keep an open mind.

0,"It is interesting that St. Paul names a female apostle.  In Romans 16:7 (NRSV), Paul says “Greet Andronicus and Junia, ... they are prominent among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.” To be an apostle, Junia must have had an encounter with the risen Christ and engaged in missionary work.  Church fathers, including Origen, John Chrysostom and Jerome confirm that Junia was a woman.  Further, the hypothetical male name ‘Junias’ is simply unattested in ancient inscriptions, while the female Latin name ‘Junia’ has been found more than 250 times in Latin and Greek inscriptions in Rome alone! Also of note is the fact that in the early Church women were often spiritual advisers and heard confession!  The rule that only priests could hear confession wasn’t part of the early Church.  If you want to explore the history of the sacrament of reconciliation, I’d recommend Monica Hellwig’s book """"Sign of Reconciliation and Conversion: The Sacrament of Penance for Our Times""""!

0,"Those experiencing a sudden tax requirement, after paying nothing, would certainly hate it short-term, but if everybody were required to pay at least a small amount of tax--say 5-10%--and this universal tax requirement became the norm over time, future earners would tend to vote Rep, I think, to keep that tax low. AND requiring that universal tax would level out the tax burden, moving toward a low, standard rate for everyone, a flat tax, essentially.  In that sense, raising taxes a bit on that 40% or so who now pay no tax would be a boon for Reps in the long-term, but in the long-term only, because taxpayers in the middle class tend to vote Republican. They would certainly suffer a backlash in the short-term, however. Trouble is, they are so focused on re-election that they worry more about the short-term reaction.

Bishop Burke's history of misleading the faithful and the public include,  self investigating, self policing and being the final judge in all accusations of clergy abuse. This was revealed by Fr. James Connel a Milwaukee Archdiocese priest and canon lawyer who identified how Bishop Burke was reporting numbers that were dramatically different than other diocese'.

Also at that time, Canada should be partway through some more hearings on the Trans Mountain pipeline, maybe a Royal Commission even,  the Canadian dollar will be plumbing new lows, unemployment will stubbornly remain above 6%, our yearly wealth transfers via carbon credits to foreign nations will reach into the billions and Canada will still be looking for various sugar daddies to lead us to prosperity.

Yes, the Supreme Court Judges had a good idea of the DESTINATION that is appropriate for timing of trials. But in seeking that destination, they loftily demanded a strict and unmovable and arbitrary deadline of when all that needed to be done MUST be done.

You are also ignoring the fact of how popular the AR-15 rifle has become among gun owners.   Millions of these murderous weapons are owned here in America now.   Every single person that owns one of these guns has a weapon that can easily be illegally converted into a machine gun!  The states of both New York and California both estimate that the majority of the Assault rifles owned in those states have not been legally registered by their owners!  There is no more a legitimate need or right to own a AR-15, than there is to own a 50 caliber machine gun.   Both are extremely dangerous.

Similarly is should not be so easy to find inaccurate reporting by mainstream media.  Trump is being really stupid in his treatment of the media but the media is equally stupid in its treatment of him. It is a battle to see which side backs down. Both sides need the trust of the people.  Both sides need to calm down and figure out a common ground. There will be no winners in this battle so a truce is needed.

We were also taught that our justice system swings like a pendulum.  We go, for lack of better terms, from liberal and gentle to conservative and strict.  I think the pendulum began swing to the gentle side coming out of the 60's and into the early to mid 70's (when I entered law enforcement) and that it is now, 40-50 yrs later, beginning to swing the other way.

Most calls are made when we see failure to thrive, repeated UTI's or infections that do not respond to antibiotics, weight loss from poor appetite, multiple complex medical issues, end stages heart failure, cancer, end stages dementia, COPD, kidney failure, etc.  If your wanting comfort at end of life, you have the option of not taking life prolonging medications, such as heart medications, insulin, dialysis, or any other life sustaining treatments. They will add pain medications and other meds to help keep you comfortable to prevent suffering. Facilities do not make money off of hospice patients meds.

"
0,"One of issues not discussed in the US Health care debate is why does the United States spend over 17 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare. Canada is 10.4 % The biggest reason is that U.S. healthcare delivers a more expensive mix of services. For example, a much larger proportion of physician visits in the U.S. are to specialists who get higher fees and usually order more high-tech diagnostic and therapeutic procedures than primary care physicians. This lack of accountability for outcomes compounded with a model that rewards volume over value has created a bloated system. A second important reason for higher healthcare spending in the U.S. is higher prices for inputs such as drugs and the services of specialist physicians. The fees of specialist physicians are typically two to three times as high as in other countries. The third and last important reason for higher spending in the U.S. is high administrative costs of insurance.

Re: your second point, I argue that the Greatest Generation was well aware that they were fighting fascist Nazis and understood how dangerous they were, even without knowing exactly what they were up to.  The fact that we now know just how hideous they were, and that neo-Nazis fully embrace that hideousness, only strengthens my basic point.  There is no such thing as a """"very fine"""" neo-Nazi.   Since our President doesn't understand that, it follows that he would consider the Greatest Generation no more than hooligans and fools.  Perhaps especially those who gave their lives for their country.

Instead, pragmatically, The National Popular Vote bill is 61% of the way to guaranteeing the majority of Electoral College votes and the presidency in 2020 to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in the country, by changing state winner-take-all laws  (not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, but later enacted by 48 states), without changing anything in the Constitution, using the built-in method that the Constitution provides for states to make changes.  All voters would be valued equally in presidential elections, no matter where they live.

Thus it is not guns to blame in my opinion, but people, the ones who will not be stopped from assaulting, raping, robbing, or just killing others, by whatever violent means they employ. For a woman, or those easily preyed upon, being so familiar with firearms as a tool of defense, it can be the great equalizer to a violent, evil, felon, and there are many free and walking in society as we well know, from carrying out their will on them.

I think I probably had the same reaction the first few times I went to the EF, having been deprived of it for the first 40+ years of my life.  These days I struggle to attend the Novus Ordo with my family and go to the EF whenever possible.  There are 2 main reasons:  (1) the Novus Ordo (and its calendar) are inferior, and (2) Pope Paul VI had absolutely no right to presume to change the Mass and impose his liturgy upon the church--that was an act of sheer Ultramontane arrogance:  the """"spirit of Vatican One"""".  But wouldn't it be nice if we stopped trying to impose our own personal worship preferences on other Catholics?  Let parishes offer both the Tridentine Mass and the Bugnini-Montini ritual, and let people go where they will.  My bet is they'll go for the quickest option.

Your clear articulation erodes as we get closer to today's all volunteer army that is only differentiated between a soldier and a mercenary by 'loyalty' to a side. But when the government in this case, doesn't have a side except as it floats across corporate growth-- like selling planes to the Saudi's. Consider, Trumps delight at the sales he's closed in the Middle East.  What veterans who oppose war are acknowledging is a betrayal of trust. That the greater good defiled by corporate interests makes selling war thru lies gradually turns a soldier into a paid mercenary who can't live outside of combat or combat support. A gun - for hire. Veterans are trying to talk about this betrayal of trust openly.  A President who doesn't know that he is the president of the US Virgin Islands.

0,"Dear SE Slayer; I worked in a school for 12 years the teachers there were worthless as friends because as soon as school started their complete devotion to their students precluded any other activity. The 1+2 nd grade teacher would observe the Kindergarten class figure out strengths and weaknesses and order texts for the next year. Also even the boys had good handwriting, you could look at the papers years later and see the teachers input. A math teacher found his students were not up to his standards so starting in the 7 th grade he took all the math skills from the 3rd grade up, made a full page test that had to be passed, if not a 2-3 page worksheet would be gone through then retested. This was prior to computers so it was all typed by the teacher. When those students got to high school they all just ripped thru Algebra I, finishing the entire text including the 'Advanced"""" section at the back. This guy got 4 hrs of sleep per day due to his dedication. I worked nights so saw it

Trump, on the other hand, spent much of the exchange repeating the same worn Trumpisms that helped him win the Republican nomination: he knows more about ISIS than the generals, Barack Obama/Hillary Clinton are bad, and his business experience qualifies him to be commander-in-chief.  His business experience???? Four bankruptcies and another on the way. He would probably take all the tax money and save his failing businesses.

This is what I fear in """"doctrines"""" like complementarity, which while seeming less blunt than Natural Law, still tries to in essence prescribing how each gender ought to express itself.

It's not clear what that was based on, or how carefully the court examined the evidence.  It is clear that, even if the woman's detention was justified, (the Criminal Code permits it but, as you clearly suspect, it is VERY rare) the conditions of it were not.

It's not always that clear cut whether a """"hit"""" from e-Verify is always accurate. As such, I could see a series of court challenges when it denies employment. I agree that employers need to be punished for KNOWINGLY hiring illegals, but they also need to be protected (from the govt and from job applicants) for bad data provided by the applicant and within govt databases. Probably need something like a 2-year mandatory test period before the penalties kick in.  And while I don't want an actual """"wall"""", I do think we need a stronger border.

Chuck Grassley on Wednesday about the attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, his answer was remarkable and revealing.  """"You know, I could maybe give you 10 reasons why this bill shouldn't be considered,"""" the Iowa Republican said. """"But Republicans campaigned on this so often that you have a responsibility to carry out what you said in the campaign. That's pretty much as much of a reason as the substance of the bill.""""

0,"That's the source of the entire myth. In the 1930s and 40s, any water with fluoride over 1 ppm was considered dangerous and industry was creating a lot of fluoride pollution resulting in lots of lawsuits costing cities money to defluoridate. So an industry scientist said """"they used to think a little fluoride was good."""" Polluters found a dentist who still believed that & mounted a marketing campaign around the myth, getting an industry lawyer in place in government. They then said up to 1.4 ppm f was good for your teeth & 2.5 was the danger level. In the 1980s, because industry polluters were going over that limit which required cities to clean water (expensive), the EPA raised the danger limit that required defluoridation to 4ppm. Read The Fluoride Deception by investigative reporter Chris Bryson for the historical political bit.

0,"Isabella Ventula-Chong, you need to pay attention. There's been a ton written about imminent domain and the rail project. There have been a few cases that went to court, but the vast majority have settled. With regard to buses running from Middle St., three large buses would only hold about 225 passengers. Taking traffic lanes away from the existing congested traffic for a zipper lane would only make matters worse. The train will carry 800 people and will leave every 5 minutes during peak travel times. The goal is to move people, not cars.

The real question is, how long will it take him to violate his probation and what will the consequences be? Perhaps another week in jail? I put the over/under at 18 months before he illegally drives again.  This kid doesn't live in a fishbowl, he lives in a bubble of narcissism. He's nineteen and past due to grow up and be responsible, which includes not risking innocent people's lives without their consent.

Lotsa KM participation at fundraisers?  With the new tankers joining the large numbers already at Cherry Point and Anacortes, the dangerous passage through Burrard inlet eliminated and the ancient existing pipe much safer with new alarm, surveillance and control systems, there'd be less fodder for criticism, lots more oil, less chance of a spill.  Still an iffy investment as shipping tar by rail is far safer and only a buck or two more per bbl. At room temperature, the stuff is so thick ya' can stand on it. In an accident the stuff would hold the rail car or tanker together.  When the market for the tar disappears as driverless EV's make scrapping old fossil fueled vehicles an economic no brainer, we'll still have the track upgrades and tanker cars that we can adapt to other uses.

It appears in entertainment at hotel luau dinners when other cultures of the South Pacific perform Tahitian Dancing and Fire Dancing under the guise of being authentic Hawaiian dance when it is not.  It appears in the way the word Aloha is 'advertised' and encouraged to be used in place of 'hello' 'goodbye'' 'I love you'  instead of it's true meaning which is embodied in the Aloha Spirit of the original people themselves.  It appears when the language is used inappropriately commercially for monetary gain.  It appears in daily life and day by day is getting worse with people taking sacred rituals to a new low adopting them into the new age movement and twisting them to fit into their own beliefs while using the original Hawaiian name for the label of their altered practices.

Trump supporters believe a silver-spooned billionaire (who has not experienced one day of want in his existence) is the man to reverse corporate globalist policies and save them from corrupt politicians. This even though Trump has imported foreign workers, imports steel for his building, and even Ivanka's clothing line is made offshore. Trump supporters are easily conned.

0,"Mr. Knudson, Alaskans enjoyed a 12.5% Royalty on 19 million barrels of oil for free  The people of the United States bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 and gave it to Alaskans for free in 1959 at statehood! Alaska oil workers have made Alaska great and it is time to support them!  The credits are less then 1% of what the state got from oil companies in royalty.  I suggest you say thank you and support Alaska’s oil workers.  Stop the monopoly and rigged system that is killing the state and keeping Alaskan out of the business  In 1967 a near broke company called ARCO found Prudhoe Bay and saved Alaska from poverty and the state has lived free off of that discovery for 40 years!  Now the big three and uninformed short sighted people want to run out the small oil exploration companies operating on the Alaskan N.S., why?  You’re wrong for saying they are “financial a joke”!

When you make employees too expensive, you simply can't have as many on the payroll.  In the last three years of my administration, we had five police academies and these are the officers expanding the force today. Oh, and by the way, crime was down during the six years of my administration compared to the previous six years.  My homeless coordinator, now the city ombudsman, stated that my administration had done more to combat homelessness than any previous administration.  So, despite the cheap shot fired by the authors, I am proud of what we accomplished.  Obviously, there is a lot more to be done and I wish the Berkowitz administration well in their efforts.

In civil jurisprudence, it too often happens that there is so much law (and nuances of it to unravel in court cases and appeals), that there is no room for justice or even a modest resolution that pleases both parties. A claimant can expire of wrong in the midst of right, as it were (like a mariner dying of thirst in the midst of water). In the minds of many, to seek the redress of grievances by going after all the diocese's parishes (of families who had nothing to do with sin or crime) is like sheep running for shelter to a bramble bush, the parishioners' prickly shrub. Hopefully, over time, both parties will work out some kind of compromise, to the liking of parishioners, victims, church officials and the law firms of both sides. Ultimately, lawyers win.

Trudeau's grandfather, one-time Liberal cabinet minister James (Jimmy) Sinclair, was an expert retail politician and Trudeau gets that side of politics from him.

I believe grade-separated rail, transit-oriented development, and other policies aimed at achieving meaningful mode shift (from cars to alternatives) would have been clearly shown to save Oahu residents $50-100 billion over a 30-40 year time horizon. This would have meant the rail project was a piece of implementing a larger plan with larger policy goals, rather than just a stand alone project with often ambiguous objectives.

So I don't think it's just a Liberal thing.

Indeed, he never specified precisely what about the report was inaccurate, nor did he offer information in its place that he deems to be accurate. Nor did the report specifically state that anyone had done anything untoward, only that sources the newspaper trusts said there was contact. Whether that contact was improper or illegal has yet to be determined.  And, oh by the way, the FBI is still looking into that very thing. If former director had said the entire matter is fiction, there would be no reason for the FBI to continue that investigation – especially while Mr. Comey was still director.  What Mr. Ruder is apparently annoyed with may be the press’s First Amendment freedom to publish information that he doesn’t want to hear.  The larger concern is and should be that President Trump appears to have tried to influence the FBI director and its work. That didn't change.

So, as far as retirees go it would be a very niche market.  However, as far as an AirBnB or 'cabin' for visitors it would be great.  Plus, it wouldn't have to be """"a 'tiny town' like a trailer park"""" i feel it could be done in small sets like 6 or 8 homes and have a common area shared with amenities that the homes do not have, ie washer and dryers, similar to some of the cabin layouts in Tok for example.  Tl;dr , it can be done, but it is only as good as the person/people running it and the 3 L's of real estate; location, location, location.

Much of  our society's empathy has been eroded away thanks to the permission granted by Chicago School Economics (aka neoliberalism economics), which has been embraced and parroted by the many mediocre and venal politicians.

Yes boys and girls you can behave as shitty as you want because it's all out of your control; not your fault.  And, if you embrace selfishness with gusto, you will be praised as ambitious and successful.  All very normal and, in fact, healthy, or so many of us have been lead to believe.

Think of how hard they fight/pay to get their product on the eye-level shelf. Or all those companies that used negative option billing - knowing that people would be too lazy or busy to actively decline.  In the end, economics continues to lay claim as the superior """"science"""" of social sciences. Except economics is far from being able to deal with the complexities of society and social behaviour in their models.

Following a 1996 cabinet shuffle, she relinquished the Environment portfolio and became Minister of Canadian Heritage.  Copps resigned briefly in the spring of 1996. One of Chrétien's campaign promises had been to abolish Brian Mulroney's highly unpopular Goods and Services Tax, a promise he later reneged on in an effort to avoid decreasing government revenues. During the 1993 election campaign, Copps promised during a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation """"town hall"""" program that she would resign if the GST was not abolished.

Which they certainly would.  In my neighbourhood, the university wanted to build a high-rise student residence – in part to reduce pressure on local housing from student rentals. City councillors and local homeowners were both against it. In the end, the OMB was the only reason the project was ever built.  Neutering the OMB is a bad idea that works directly against the government's other stated goals (density, affordability, etc).

0,"The presence and impact of foreign buyers in the GTA housing market is a poorly-kept secret held close to the pocket book by realtors.  I have family in the industry.

Denying the obvious is laughable.

0,"So was the business built on seizing properties that are going up in value when the mortgages default? Or on collecting when people realise that they can't keep up the payments and sell, at a higher price than they paid?  That Business Model only works as long as prices are rising steeply and people keep buying homes. I remember people ending up in negative equity situations in 1982, and being unable to sell because the market had stalled.  I remember my sister in laws husband lying to the mortgage company about his income. He had used Billy (William Bennett II) Bribes to try and keep up, a stupid BC Government Program that loaned people money to subsidise their mortgage payments to an effective rate of 16%. I told the genius that the money was a loan and was a lien on his house. He didn't believe me, but discovered the truth when it came to transfer title.  OTOH, my wife and I didn't need the interest free subsidy, but collected and invested it. Then got 10% for early repayment.

The left  uses populism to lament our collective failure to bring the world that """"ought to be """" into existence.  This world would see the disappearance of inequalities of all kinds if only the elected leaders of the people would make it possible. The right will use populism in rhetoric that extols the virtues of yesterday, where conformity created a narrative that everyone followed (e.g., work hard, say your prayers, Protestant work ethic,, etc.) and benefited from immensely.  Of course, the halcyon era of the past cannot be repeated. What is the broader context, then?  Trump? Racism? Xenophobia? Bigotry?

As soon as Hammond's original concept of the PFD linked to length of residence was defeated, the legislature could have shifted that dividend benefit from individuals to local communities for the general welfare of those communities and to create local governments. Instead our elected officials encouraged the creation of the current oligarchy we have now. Vast sums of wealth remained concentrated at the state government level and local governments became totally dependent on that state government.  To illustrate, after all those billions and all those years we still are using honey buckets in many areas of Alaska and where law enforcement can, at best, only react to serious situations.  The individual dividend has become nothing more than """"hush money"""" to placate the populace while the state government, with all that available cash, became the ATM that created economic """"winners"""" in a quid pro quo of political support for state funding.

Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith..."""") - a Muslim mosque in Texas burned down last night, and investigators are probing it as possible hate crime, having arrested a local man for a hate crime a few years ago involving that mosque.  Hello?  Germany's 1930's press was no conduit of empathy and facts about minorities. Indeed, Goebbels, the government master of newspapers then, fired all Jewish journalists in 1933. Cartoons of Jews as rodents then appeared, and claims that Jews needed blood of Christians for rituals.  Get a grip. America is not 1930s Germany. Not even close.

Gee, does anyone think that Flynn's firing should have been a clue to the Trump transition team, not just as to vetting him, but as to even hiring him? Well, sure, but Trump considered the Obama administration with the same kind of contempt that Bush43's transition team regarded Bill Clinton's administration.  That's why many national security and CIA analysts, even those hired before Clinton's 1st term, were fired or transferred. That turned out to be unfortunate for this country on 9/11 and beyond.  The same kind of fate may befall us now that Trump has purged many very experienced NSA experts. Until recently, there was no one at the North Korea desk at the National Security Agency.

Rail is meaningless to improving the quality of life simply because its importance is only on rush hours in the morning and afternoon on weekdays and is useless for everything else except for commuting purposes.  What  all rail advocates need to know is that today,  Traffic Congestion on Streets - not highways, not freeways but streets and only streets - is a reality and is actually successfully accomplished in many cities in the mainland with the employment of modern technology designed exactly for Traffic Congestion Reduction.  In addition,  travel time is saved by converting heavily traveled intersection into a new design that enables vehicles to make left turns simultaneously with thru traffic.

0,"Thanda:  as peaceful mass protest with big impact, the tax revolt deserves attention.  Companies cannot withhold PAYE as those are not company funds.   That still leaves provisional taxpayers - of which there are plenty in individuals and in companies.  My concept is that we complete and submit tax returns, but not proceed to the payment button.  Not submitting a return is one offence, thus avoided.   Not paying is going to expose one to interest.   So there'd be a cost to the extent SARS interest exceeds whatever else you can earn.  If organised as a proper tax revolt the taxpayer could pay the funds over to a trust like Helen Suzman Foundation to be held in escrow - proof that we are part of an action and not just delinquent.  SARS can unilaterally try and sweep your linked bank account but if you don't have funds there... If SARS proceeds to court action he cannot get to 100,000 people before the impact is large and gains ConCourt protection as civil disobedience

Consider that our consumer electronics industries got wiped out by foreign ( Japanese, 1970's ) competition who delivered more advanced, higher quality and less expensive product.

The article also reported that people from the village discovered old records that 400,000 walrus were killed in the distant past by whalers. There was an undoubtably a far larger population of walrus over 100 years ago then there is now. But, we still have people hunting this stressed walrus population and reducing their numbers by 250 animals per year {based on the reported kills} and people are wondering why they are having a harder and harder time finding walruses?

By in large head contact is illegal for all minor hockey players regardless of what the NHL is doing, so I believe we are already on the right track.

Probably not, though the US military could leave those countries and let them fight it out themselves. The killing would still continue, but it might be less.  The fact is Cuba's dead are not largely on American hands. Yes, the US gov't meddled. Castro did most of that killing himself or through surrogates, or by allowing Che Guevara to fulfill his fantasies of shooting people in the head with impunity. How do I know that? I know a few Cubans in exile who lived through Castro's reign of terror. Castro may not have started as an evil man, but he became an evil man as he went along.

As well, how can one avoid speaking of the creation and western support for a Jewish nation? It is a fact of history. How then can we face the Muslims who were disenfranchised, whose homeland was reduced to something that resembles little more than a penal colony?  Conversely the Jews were themselves exiled as they had been before. Coming from somewhere, yet belonging nowhere. Did they not, after the horrors of the Third Reich, finally deserve a home, historically validated, when so much of their world in exile had been laid waste? What were the former Jewish sections of Warsaw, Prague and Budapest now but rubble devoid of the possibility of life? Where was their home if it no longer existed?

Most charters have been allowed to use all sorts of tactics in their start-up and operations: building to residential instead of heavy-use commercial standards, lightly-credentialed staff, avoidance of special needs students, building in profit margins for investors.  The apparent low-cost of charters is deceptive as their unfunded capital maintenance needs amount to a """"balloon payment"""" due from taxpayers.  Charters cannot protect intellectual property.

But the traps never quite worked.  The Conservatives and NDP wore out the  Just Not Ready ad.  Then JT picked up the husk and with a deft Judo flip, turned it into a pre sold, """"I'm Ready"""" ad.  Canadians, tired of the other ad's overreach, agreed.  Andrew Scheer's idea of leadership seems also to involve a lot of Acme Hardware purchases, and the 10.5 million dollar wedge is as hopeful as any Harper attempted.  JT's response here simply involves driving the wedge back the other way.  The Acme hammer of the talking points is the 71% figure from a single online survey by paid contributors.  If three or four new surveys show the opposite, Wiley E. Sheer will have black soot all over his face when the argument blows up in his face.

Your analogy is false.  Most Southern soldiers did not own slaves.  The premier Southern generals, Lee & Jackson, thought that slavery would die a natural death.  Indeed, their wills freed their slaves.  Lincoln only turned to slavery as an issue in the Emancipation Proclamation because he wished to keep Britain & France out of the War.  Lincoln freed the slaves in areas of the country where the Union had no control, but he permitted slavery in the Border States and those areas of the South which the Union controlled.  Lincoln and his cronies could have saved immense amounts of blood & treasure simply by purchasing slaves at auction.  But his goal was domination not emancipation per se.  Indeed, Lincoln wished to deport blacks after the War because he believed that blacks & whites could not coexist.

Even on National Coming Out Day (whenever that is) such a mass exodus from the priestly closet is highly unlikely.

Alaska has a tradition of liberal and not narrow construction of rights and a long tradition of adding rather than the subtracting of rights under our Constitution. Under Ravin V State, 537 P. 2d 494;1975 the Supreme Court specifically extended the privacy section in our Constitution (Art I, S 22) to the smoking of pot by individuals in private. Representative LeDoux raises a crucial question vis a vis what constitutes """"public vs private"""" in light of our Rights to Privacy explicitly framed in Article I.  AG Lindemuth's interpretation is a """"reductio ad absurdum"""": When does the number of private individuals exercising their rights in private become """"public""""? 2, 3, a dozen? More? Clearly the issue of privacy does not turn on a number. This IS legislating through regulation and is unconstitutional at that!

0,"In your scenario, if white people were committing the crimes they were accused of they need to suffer the consequences of their choices. Making excuses for criminals is a big contributor to recidivism. Excuses for their poor choices does nothing towards helping them learn from their mistakes. Instead, it emboldens them to continue making the same mistakes over and over. . As far as the real world, we need to continue locking up criminals, we need to find ways to make prisons less costly and less desirable. We can start by disallowing family/friends to send in money for commissary. We could turn a prison into it's own mini-economy by allowing different types of work programs. A portion of the wages earned can go to housing costs, reparations etc. They could use a portion for setting them up for release and a portion for commissary. Something like this would help criminals take responsibility for their actions moving forward.

Then the amount of the tip that has escalated from the historical 15% norm to the more recent 18-20% will be automatically applied further increasing the cost and adding to the take home pay ( untaxed typically so it is worth even more).  Maybe it is time to do away with tipping altogether now that the living wage is included in the cost of the meal.

One of the messages of the Joint Review Panel Report was that Hydro never seriously considered alternatives to Site C - particularly geothermal energy. Although, nobody has com up with a credible argument for why we need the power Site C is intended to provide, it has been shown (by CANGEA) that geothermal can achieve the same levels of baseload power generation - incrementally (as we need it) at a comparable cost and less environmental/cultural damage.  Why doesn't John Horgan support this alternative?

0,"Bristol Bay should be conserved, and the only way that is going to happen is through a national monument designation. the 5000 acre limit on monuments in ANILCA has never been subjected to scrutiny by the court, precedent set in Cameron vs US and Alaska vs Carter would hold that monuments larger than 5000 acres are permitted. in Bristol Bays case, 5000 acres is nowhere nearly enough of an area to protect the fishery, and protecting the fishery is a matter of both scientific and historic importance. It will likely require a monument larger than any Carter created(his largest was 10.95M acres) to conserve the fishery, again the courts have repeatedly said it is not the size of an monument, but what the area contains, that matters. Bristol Bay easily meets the criteria of the Antiquities Act, and President Obama should designate it as a monument. Alaska will challenge , of course, and it will lose for lack of standing, as with Alaska vs Carter

States have had the same problem with under reporting of liquor stores sales since the day Prohibition was repealed.  But it certainly highlights the mistake that states make when they see Big Tax Buck$$$ as the result of legalizing cannabis.  If states weren't so greedy, if they didn't impose usurious taxes on these products, there'd be a lot less incentive for stores to under report their sales.

1,"It's a little early to start trying to revise history and think you won't get called on it.  Trump authorized the raid, he gave the green light.  And it's said he did so after finding out President Obama hadn't authorized the raid.  When first presented with the plan, Trump wasn't interested.  But then he heard President Obama hadn't green lighted it.  Trump was all of a sudden very interested in pushing the raid through.  And the upshot now?  Now that Trump's first action he authorized went sideways, he wants to remove himself from the process so he has someone else to blame for any mistakes.  Trump, the man who shirks responsibility, who blames others, who runs from the responsibility of leadership.  He's a buffoon. A weak and insecure con man and a traitor.

0,"I read the zero hedge article and I am 99.999% sure I understand it better than you.  First of all, your categorizing it as a """"rookie mistake"""" is incorrect because it is the industry standard.  When you say Scott, and the industry, should take into consideration """"total volume of contracts"""", that  demonstrates you don't really know what you're talking about.  In futures contracts, there's daily volume and there's open interest.  But what zero hedge is really talking about is the dollar amount of the open interest (and in a strange tangent talking about specs as a % of total).  And I'll very quickly show you why zero hedge is wrong.  To start, units is sometimes (and sometimes not) the correct measurement.  When dealing with significant price volatility it is the correct measurement.  After all, the world produces and consumes oil in units, not in dollars, that's generally the price inelasticity of demand (and sort of but not entirely of supply).  Continued..

Instead of continually focusing on our differences and how those difference cannot be overcome, would it not be much more productive and healing to focus on our many, many commonalities?

Francesco has very few political degrees of freedom in which to operate.  Francesco was elected in the conclave with the support of many of the most regressive hierarchs.  As a politician, those hierarchs are part of Francesco's political base.  How can he reform the church, or heal the wounds of sexually exploited children, without these very same hierarchs [think: Raymond Burke] who are maneuvering every day to block every one of his reforms?  The only real way out of this mess is for Francesco to call for the resignations of any hierarch who was even remotely complicit in the sexual assault and exploitation of children by priests and bishops.

0,"You clearly do not understand the life cycle of toxoplasma gondii or how people and animals become infected.  Toxoplasma gondii (Tg) can only complete its life cycle in the intestine of a member of the cat family.  Only cats.  The cat then sheds the Tg oocysts (eggs) in its feces by the tens of millions per cat.  Rats and other mammals do not shed oocysts.  Only cats.  The reason the soil, water, or plant material is contaminated with oocysts is because cats are shedding them.  There would not be environmental contamination of oocysts if cats weren't there to shed them.  Recent research indicates that cats can become reinfected and go through add'l oocyst shedding cycles.  The oocysts are very durable and can remain viable in soil or water for 18 months or more.  In dry conditions they can become aerosolized and inhaled.  Oocysts can also be spread by insects or rodents from feces to food sources.

I do think it would have provided insight into their positions relative to Trumps policies.  Sure seems that there is NO advocacy happening for the 120 days stoppage of refugee resettlement. Its like everyone's given up and accepted it while putting all the energy into immigration reform.  My heart doesn't let me look to closely at the impact of the stoppage. Its too painful.  carry on my friend, I will have to sit this crisis out.

0,"Thanks Dave! This was an interesting and helpful list...top fives are good... But undergirding this is the need to provide learners an educational foundation that is interesting, challenging and humane. Further, to really accept that different kiddos need different things, learn that this diversity in community could be a good thing. And part of this is that while we need a common values and expectations we must, in turn, allow children to develop skills, and knowledge while learning the purpose of their education. For too many students school is pointless hoop-jumping, and quite a few drop out, too many of those that stay are mentally disengaged. Learning should be useful, sensible, fun, challenging, hard work that matters. Students should be part of this team, along with the broader community. When we look at programs that work they bring in a community context, solve problem, learn cool stuff, apply their knowledge in a real world to solve problems that matter.

When asked about heaven, hell, angels and the devil, the believers range from 72% belief (angels) to 61% belief (devil).   Among young adults born between 1990 - 1996, only 80% believe in God.  Studies of """"nones"""" and SBNRs indicate that they do not forgo church because they don't believe in God, but because they  do not believe that organized religions reflect God in how they conduct themselves and teach (hypocrisy is a big turn-off), nor do they find that organized religion helps them in the spiritual journey. So they seek paths to God that are not confined to organized religion.  As you say, the forces in motion are unlikely to be stopped in the RCC by adding priests.

0,"Integration is far more difficult with high immigration levels happening primarily due to economic purposes - immigrants move into ethnic enclaves where they don't have to integrate, mainly because the primary driver of migration and immigration now is money. It used to be freedom and culture which also drove the desire to integrate. Now it is ONLY money, with ethnic enclaves big enough to prevent any integration and moderation by many who reject western values while embracing the social benefits based on those values.  The added downside is that immigrants are doing worse and worse economically as higher immigration levels create more competition and a labour oversupply which drives down everyone's wages. They are disillusioned quickly.  The real problem for integration is high immigration levels: lower immigration levels and most of the problems fix themselves.

1,"I think sex within marriage carries as much or little as weight as the couple decide it should.  But if, God forbid, my penis were cut off, there would be no less love in my marriage, nor would my marriage be in jeopardy.  I think because of modern perspectives in sex (thanks to Kinsey the quack, et al.), too many people over-emphasize the importance of sex in life.  The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.  Ironically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.  My college-age daughter told me sex is a prerequisite to dating!

0,"This fatwa issued by the Quebec government is, supposedly, about ensuring state neutrality over matters of religion.*  Quebec has forbidden veiled Muslim women from receiving government services, supposedly because the veil is a mark of their religious beliefs. Surely you see the explicit discrimination?  A Catholic priest dressed in religious attire can receive government services in Quebec. A Jew wearing a yarmulka and a Sikh wearing his turban can receive the same. Ditto for a Buddhist monk in his robes. But for dark reasons they won't admit, the Quebec government will not provide government services to Muslim women in veils.  Read it and weep. Quebec's law isn't about security, it isn't about women's rights, and it isn't about secularity. It's about discriminating against Muslim women.  *Bill 62 : """"An Act to foster adherence to State religious neutrality...""""  http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-62-41-1.html

And if United has not yet issued orders at every level and location to avoid ANY aggravating and news-worthy incidents, then they are stupider than I think.  Second, there is plenty of blame to assign.  Let's start with corporate policy and culture.  Yes, all big airlines are more alike than different, but the differences matter.  I was a very frequent business and personal flyer several years ago in Houston and experienced the Continental to United change, which seemed mostly for the worse.  I have also experienced plenty of international travel on foreign carriers.  Whether real or forced, the cabin crews, especially on Asian airlines, put most US crews to shame in terms of friendliness and helpfulness.  Why?  Grumpy staff?  Unions?  Corporate policy (again)?  Finally, I will point at us.  We say we want good service, but refuse to pay for it.  Most Americans buy the cheapest tickets.  And then complain.

At no time did he feel threatened, but the smoke was heavy and made the eclipse even more surreal.  More than fuel reduction and """"thinning"""", it was the many private logging roads which were easily dozed into containment lines; the safe air space for fire retardant tankers, including huge VLTs; and the cooler, wet weather second week in September which """"saved the town of Sisters"""", a full nine miles away.  Most of this fire burned through heavily cut over private forestlands, the big open grown, fire resistant ponderosa pines having been replaced, by default, with tightly packed flammable young lodgepole. Heavy logging slash from decade old operations didn't decompose in the dry eastside climate like it does in our part of the woods and further fueled this fire.  Worth a look!

That is intolerable in any country that hopes to call itself a democracy.

Seven states and the nation of Mexico rely on the River to one degree or another. The original Colorado River Compact overestimated the amount of water in the Colorado River on an average basis -- and ignored Mexico completely. Mexico's concerns (for the moment) are addressed with a treaty between it and the US, which reduced the amount of Colorado River water available to those seven states. A new agreement between the seven states addresses the total amount of water available in any particular year, but the fact of the matter is there are tens of millions of people living in semi-arid or desert conditions in the southwestern USA, and many of those people want the same landscaping and the same water use as people in Iowa or Kentucky, where the rainfall is many times higher. Too many people love deficit spending -- when it comes to water.

The VA found the ability to negotiate the price of the drugs it supplies to us veterans so there is a way for Medicare to do it also if only there was the political will.

0,"Statistics Canada said gasoline prices were up 20.6 per cent from a year earlier, the biggest increase since September, 2011. The increase reflected the introduction of a carbon tax in Alberta and a cap-and-trade carbon pricing system in Ontario, both of which came into effect on Jan. 1, as well as higher crude-oil prices, which lifted fuel costs nationwide.  so what I'm assuming Mr Trudeau, Ms Notley and Ms Wynne will do now is assign their various ministries to  report on the reduction of automobile, truck, train and air transportation use as a direct result of the increasing price of their carbon-based fuels. Perhaps even easier ...just report on the amount of gasoline purchased prior and the amount after ..over a comparable period....there should be tens of thousands of people switching to public transit , bikes or walking with a 21% increase in price wouldn't you think...or would you ?

It shows people in countries near the Catholic-Orthodox borders much more willing to consider mixed marriages than people in regions where one faith strongly predominates.  But more realistically it probably just shows that religious scruple is popular only until it begins restricting the marriage market. If the only unmarried Catholic in town is a bald bankrupt drunk, Orthodox men don't seem so bad.

Next time your house is being broken into, why don't you call a thug to help you out?  There have obviously been a few egregious cases of policemen unjustifiably shooting people, both black and white. But, as the author says, even those few cases are overplayed in the media and create the perception that it is a wide spread and frequent epidemic. Given the risks of the job that the cops willingly do and the instantaneous life and death judgements that must be made, I think IN general, they do a remarkable job and I heartily salute them.

0,"Why not simply be humble and accept what has been taught by the Church for centuries, through scripture, tradition, patristics , councils and exegesis.  Nobody is advocating biblical literalism, just that the Church sticks to objective moral truths. If these truths are subject to the changes in human society, then they are not truths an are merely relativistic constructs.  If we reach that point why even bother with religion, it is meaningless and useless without objectively true teachings.  In any case, the church has not made a bigger case about divorce than helping the poor, it is tone of the largest charity provider when it comes to NGO's. This did not happen overnight, people have heard the gospel for centuries. The issue is that helping the poor has never been contested as much as divorce. It is narrow path of the cross that people object to when it requires uniting our deepest sacrifices to our Lords.  (1/2)

0,"The average suppression level, according to independent tests done on a variety of commercially available suppressors, is around 30 dB, which is around the same reduction level of typical ear protection gear often used when firing guns.  However, for most commercially available fire arms and cartridges, this ends up only reducing the noise level to somewhere in the range of 130-150-ish dB for a supersonic cartridge and 117-130-ish dB for a subsonic cartridge. For reference on just how loud that is, an ambulance or police siren is typically between 100-140 dB.

Asia pays for our resources and offsets that cost with nearly slave-labour wage rates.  Why doesn't Canada exploit our cheap resources by doing what is done in Asia and still pay decent wages?  Wages that can be taxed and maintain our own wealth.  We have the resources!  Instead, we're told to spend taxpayer money subsidizing outside interests to exploit our resources by sending them off-shore and then we have to pay for garbage from China so some outside retailer can maximize profits by paying nearly slave-labour wages.

He also presided over the Savings and Loan disaster which also was a huge government expense.  The destruction of the unions in the US paved the way for the trade agreements that are supposed to be the bane of the middle class blue collar worker.  The only people I know who think Reagan's attacks on the unions was beneficial are people in management or who had never been in a union.  What I have found in right to work states is the folks like the union representation and grievance procedures, they just want those services for free.  They are true Patriotic Americans like Trump, who is proud he wasn't one those 'suckers' who actually paid taxes to support the country, just as these folks are proud they are not being forced into paying union dues for the benefits they get from Union representation.

If so many members find the situation untenable and dire, which it is, and cannot change the majority view that's reached moral nadir, they ought to resign from the party and suffer the consequences as the country is doing. That will split the ANC, which already is dead on its feet, and change everything. But, no, they won't and will continue to express loyalty to their dying days.

There are numerous examples available in the past and in recent decades from around the world where despots controlling an unarmed or weakly armed citizenry wreaked havoc on that citizenry. There are also examples of governments that were overthrown because their citizenry threatened significant violence to bring about change and had the means to do so. Do you get it CE?

If so, they are so far off-base that they need to be educated on what real journalism actually is.  Reporters from these organizations think that they are part of the story or that they are in their jobs to tell us what to think rather than reporting the real facts.  Take the Trayvon Martin story for example.  How many of them reported that Trayvon was caught in possession of a bag of stolen items taken in local burglaries?

0,"Sure, let's stay on today. 85 percent of CEOs in Canada are white males. In the general population, white males form 30 percent. So they are almost three times more white male CEOs than there should be.  If you look at the layoffs in the Canadian oil and gas industry, you can see who is targetted. However, HR won't allow you to see the demographics of the people laid off (older workers are also targeted, people of colour, less attractive women, etc).  However, if you look at university admissions, where only cutoff marks matter, than you will find that engineering schools are overwhelming non white. Minorities and women are also over represented in medicine, pharmacy, computer programming, etc.  But when it comes to promotions, the leadership starts getting whiter. Even in engineering heavy firms, the management tends to be white and male. It is no surprise then that the CEO will be a white male.

My son was incarcerated for a month shy of 2 years for a nonviolent crime, stealing a 6.99 bag of potato chips from a store, and was only released when the judge instructed the state to either give a good reason for imprisoning him for 2 years over $6.99, or release him. The probation officers were mixed. One was very helpful and did not go out of the officers way to be a hardnose stickler, the other was a hardnose and went out of her way to bait my son so he would screw up, and for a non crime mistake on his part in his probation that could have been remedied,   she popped him back behind bars for another 6 months.

Where most colleges students take pride in they're schools and support they're sports teams---UAA students don't.  Attendance numbers show UAA students don't care in the least about UAA sports .  That begs the question--why have sports teams if your own students don't care in the least ? Why raise students costs to pay for sports programs they don't even care about ?  The only students who seem to care are the one's getting a free or reduced ride at UAA and the paid coaches and administrators .

Other aspects of the ACA are pretty damn valuable too like the striking down of insurance corps ability to cut you off once you are afflicted with the Big C or terrible accident.

The difficulties with the welfare system to which my earlier comment refers are an unavoidable consequence of that aversion (unless, of course, one takes the extreme position that no public monies should be spent to provide welfare in any form - which has its own set of dire consequences).  Your position also fails to take account of the fact that robotics, information technology and the communication revolution amongst other trends are shifting income from the human workforce to the providers of capital - ergo, growing income and wealth gaps over the past 3 or more decades.  This will only get worse over the next decades and the resulting suppression of status and wellbeing for the large majority of the population cannot be justified on moral grounds implied in your comment.

An employer could be asked to declare in its tax return whether or not it offers benefits of the kind mentioned to employees and if it does, to declare how they are treated for tax purposes and reported in the employees T4 slips. This declaration would be made available to the employees so they would understand the tax consequences of taking the benefits.  The CRA could audit the declaration and challenge the value assigned to the benefits if they see fit.  Benefits  of no material value could be disregarded.  What is out of control here is not the government's efforts to plug loopholes and maintain fairness in the tax system, it is the outrageous rates of tax to which Canadian's are subject. A taxpayer taxed at the marginal rate must earn earn $122, 826 to pay for a  $50,000 car plus the $6,500 in HST on the purchase.

0,"Throughout our history, we have seen numerous examples of discrimination against certain groups arise when our country was/is engaged in conflict.  In WW1, anti-German sentiment, in WW2, anti-German and anti-Japanese sentiments.  During the cold war, we had anti-Russian sentiment.  In present day, we are engaged in a conflict against radical Islamic ideologies.  Is it any surprise that anti-muslim sentiments are present now?  Even today and in recent history, anti-semitism is prevalent.  We don't need to single out Islamophobia for special mention.  Quite frankly, what we need to hear more of is the muslim community denouncing the crazy attacks by radicalized jihadists.  It seems to me that they have been quite muted when these attacks occur around the world.  Building bridges to muslim communities has to be a two way street and it is more incumbent upon the muslim community to denounce radicals if they want to allay the fears of Islamophobia.

They are set up for hook up to septic and water, or have water tanks with grey water drains and composting toilets. They plug in or produce their own power via solar panels and a battery / inverter system. They are in no way different than a normal """"house"""". They are built to last long term with 2x4 and 2x6 framing, house wrap, metal roofs, and spray foam insulation. Also they look good. They cost in the $40,000-$65,000 range. While not super cheap, this is as much as people pay for a pickup truck for a nice starter home. They are easy to heat with good direct vent propane heaters that are very efficient. It is an excellent way to live for a small family or single person just starting out or retired empty nesters.

As I mentioned before the term father for either a bishop or priest was used in other languages long before the baltimore catechism.  Which brings us back to the original idea of instead of humility we assert our own interpretation above that of the collective Church. In this case a simple affectionate term that was even used by the apostle Paul for himself.  If we look at the passage in its entirety in contains even more condemnations for calling anyone master, rabbi, instructor and so on. If we are to take the plain reading of this passage without the lense of tradition we should all become protestants, because every apostolic church has titles like those in use.

Most people died within 10 years of retiring whereas today the average person lives another 18 years, so if raise to 67 that still means 16 years of retirement and if you live to 92 which is not uncommon today it is 25 years while 30 years if you make 97.

0,"rhockin, for the most part, I agree with you. I'm concerned about small businesses, which employ about 1/3 of Ontarians.  Many of these entrepreneurs work long hours and live humbly.  Minimum wage hikes of 30-something % is money directly out of the small businessman's pocket.  Soaring hydro rates and increases to CPP (all of which have recently happened) are quite a financial burden as well. This is why I simply can't believe that Wynne gives a dam about business (our tax base) and I'll actually venture to say that she'll love the extra tax revenue the wage hike will bring to her empty coffers.  Remember Ontario is hugely in debt, and yet needs to keep the public sector unions happy during contract talks by offering wage increases, plus enviable benefits and gold-plated pensions.  This is all done with money she doesn't even have, and the tax payers are stuck with the bill! I'll say it again--she's a morally & ethically corrupt politician who's buying votes with our $$.

It is saddening that governments in Canada do not simply tell it like it is.

You are advocating for LGBT laws to trump religious freedom rights. Many people of all religions and beliefs could care less what moral values or choices that others choose to follow, but many also have deeply held beliefs that they should not personally be involved. As in your examples LGBT laws will give LGBT a superiority over other classes.

Current employees should be given the option to withdraw every penny they have paid in, plus the contributions of their employer, plus interest based on what a 401K would have returned during that time period. Then they can invest on their own. Politicians have used PERA as a slush fund to purchase votes. They handed out unsustainable pensions to employees who paid a fraction in contributions to what they are collecting now. In addition mismanagement of the funds resulted in lousy returns on investment - and the state looted the funds, failing to pay in what they should have. If this were a private business executives would be going to prison - starting with the CEO Hickenlooper.  You can be sure this snafu is going to make it harder to hire for teaching jobs in Colorado.

Oil taxes are beyond my level of comprehension.  Simplify them to: Flat Taxing the oil pulled from the ground.  Period.  No deductions, no incentive pay.  Feel free to drill, and we'll tax what goes in the pipeline or onto a tanker, whatever.  Taxes:  that's a tough one.  Sales or income?  If we go with sales, that means everyone, rich and poor alike, will have a stake in the state's well being.  Bad side of that is it places an extra burden on townsfolk that already have a sales tax, like Wasilla, Seward.  Income tax: Make it a flat tax.

We can be opposed to the policies of those who disagree with us, but what we have now is directed toward persons and their identities. Conservatives never could get beyond the fact that President Obama was a Black man, despite his being raised in a Caucasian family, graduating from Punahou School and initially putting out his hand to them to work with him. The Kennedys were as wealthy as the Trumps, but they were not criticized by the press for their wealth. The Democratic elite is as race / ethnicity conscious as the Republicans.

According to Wynne's commissioner of climate change the CO2 molecules last nearly forever in the atmosphere, generating heat continuously. To solve two problems with one solution why doesn't the Wynne government mass produce transparent vinyl tanks of about 400litres in volume , fill them with captured CO2, thus preventing the CO2 from entering the atmosphere, and make the tanks available to homeowners as """" heat pumps"""" .

Institute a hiring freeze in the Dept of Women and Children, and I'm pretty sure women and children will be okay. Employ 500 more in that department, and they'll do no better. Right size? Probably zero.  In the private sector, the right and actual sizes of companies are not independent, because any divergence produces opportunity cost that shareholders act to resolve.

0,"As someone who has taught undergraduate university courses, I value the input I receive from students on course evaluations, but the current system of online system often has significant problems.  I often receive very valuable feedback on from an anonymous, mid-term student survey (where students receive a very small participation mark for providing input). On the other hand, the end-of-course evaluations are now done online during the busiest time of year for students. Since this is done outside classtime, there is a tendency for only those who either love or hate the course to participate.  The course evaluation system worked much better when it was done on paper during the final class which encouraged everyone to give input. Obviously, collecting the results from a paper evaluation is more labour-intensive, but perhaps using scantron or some similar technology would overcome that problem.

They don't have any money, you can't mail them a summons if they don't pay their fine? It's so easy to sit around and say """"gee, I wonder why they don't just make being a vagrant against the law, that would stop it"""". At this point there isn't much we can do, tearing out the fountain helps remove hiding places, and to be honest that fountain is not impressive, especially being broken for so many years. You can try and blame the mayor but this has been a problem for decades.

Results from phone surveys represent the subset of people who actually want to interrupt their dinners and speak to a stranger about their political preferences. When we had a landline, even though I have some definite political preferences, I always would hang up on phone surveys and if they tried to call my mobile, I would block the number. I would guess that I’m not the only person who feels this way.  The accuracy and validity of a survey instrument is directly a function of the n (assuming a goal of a 90 or 95% confidence limit) and the degree to which the sample represents the target population.

0,"It is ironic that I, of all people, find myself in a position of advocating for rail, but only because the elevated structure is approaching Middle already, and according to Panos and others, it cannot support bus traffic.  Eight years ago I helped lead Stop Rail Now with absolute conviction that bus rapid transit would be superior, and that is still true, except we are now stuck with that viaduct. So to my mind the question is how to make the best of a very bad situation.  Terminating at Middle and forcing transfer to bus has many problems -- people hate to transfer, especially descending from one mode to another down below.  Therefore the more effective solution is to bring rail down to street level, continuing at grade on North King Street into downtown, and turn around at Alapai. With that, downtown workers benefit, the urban core will be stimulated, and others can transfer to bus at Alapai.  Eventually, extension to Univ Ave on S Beretania/S King serves UH, as I explained above.

So why did the Chair of the House Intelligence Committee stand in front of the tv cameras today and announce that he had just read intelligence papers that say,  outright,  that the Obama Presidency ordered Trump surveilled,  unilaterally, downgraded the gathered information to where it was widely disseminated in order to make it easier to leak,  all before Trump was ever sworn in as President.  All of which means that what you heard from Comey, et al,  was BS,  blather,  deflection, parsing words,  and we are not anywhere near the bottom of this investigation and issue.  The Obama Presidency,  his Administration,  his name on the door labeled """"POTUS"""",  did in fact surveil,  secretly,  the communications of the Trump organization before the election and until the last day of that Presidency,  and all of the information was unilaterally downgraded in classification level to enable more risk free leaking of it to Democrat resistance organizers.

Here's another source:  """". . . it becomes evident that the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church differ in their understanding of the purpose of marriage. In orthodox theological thinking this is firstly the reciprocal love, the relationship and the help between the marriage partners with view to their completion in Christ. Only subsequently comes the restraining of their sexual passion and the reproduction of the human race. It is remarkable that in the New Testament we find no reference relating marriage to reproduction . . . To see reproduction as the principal purpose of marriage is a narrow perspective on the conjugal life of man and wife."""" ~ MARRIAGE, DIVORCE AND REMARRIAGE IN THE ORTHODOX CHURCH: Economia and Pastoral Guidance

The second question about the A Train is what idiot designed it to have all those grade crossings? It should have been elevated or below grade.

It demonstrated how even a short-term, reasoned act on the part of Trump would be spun as an act of sheer evil by his enemies, including the MSM.  Of the six countries included in Trump's temporary immigration ban, the USA is  currently making war in four of them. The other two are not what you'd call friendly to America. Are all those countries predominantly Muslim? Yes. Regardless, the security concern is glaringly obvious. And it's the US president that's specifically tasked with ensuring the security of the country.  Trump's 90-day ban on immigration from those countries, in order to conduct a close review of America's immigration policies, was eminently sensible. It was enacted within the president's mandate and of short duration only. An easy score for Trump.

Even if it did, walking blocks in the rain to get to a restaurant or the grocery store isn't exactly my idea of a good time most days, but at least there will a sidewalk to hike along. Goody.

0,"It's funny, these 'corruption' claims are empty, mostly NDP supporters, incapable of finding anything positive to say about their moribund, obsolete movement, vainly hoping to find a reason for citizens to vote against the current gov't.  It's just not getting any traction with voters. I've attended all-candidate meetings in 3 ridings and not once did the words """"corruption' or 'corrupt' get uttered by the New Dinosaur or the Green. The words 'influence' relating to donations were used, but seemed to be purposely kept vague for lack of hard evidence. Various acts of corruption are crimes, and while gov'ts often have to make difficult trade-off decions in the public interest, it's even a stretch calling them scandals.  Same with media, no journalists are dog-chasing any corruption.  The belief of systemic, party-deep corruption (as we all suffered in the Lost Decade of 1990s, and recently reminded to us by Dix ), appears to be messaging in between blind NDP believers, to self-reinforce.

The excellent paper from William Bendix and Jon Mackay confirms my belief that things will have to change a lot (i.e. hell would have to freeze over) for President Alternative Facts not bankrupting the fifth and largest company he has operated.

0,"Being a citizen of the country as required to vote, is not voter suppression.  It's a requirement in Canada too, are we suppressing votes? No.  Requiring Identification to vote, is not a form of voter suppression.  It's a requirement in Canada too, are we suppressing votes? No, we aren't.

This act of humility cannot be feigned as it bears witness to the Truth and would go a long way in healing so many wrongs wrought by the church.

0,"Why does the Ontario government want to entrench grinding poverty? This is a typical example of how craven this Ontario Liberal government is. If this is an experiment, then it is an experiment that is designed to fail because of reliance on half measures.  That's because this is not really a basic income, but really just an increase in social assistance rates. Whatever good intentions the government may have had, this experiment is undone by clawing back all income at a rate of 50 per cent.  To properly leverage the entrepreneurial potential that comes from the security of a basic income, the government should not be clawing back any income until about $30,000. Clawing back at a rate of 50 per cent of every dollar that a recipient earns simply removes the incentive to work.  People who rail against the idea of supports to ensure decent incomes for all people fail to understand basic economics, which dictate that one person's spending is another person's income.

And especially with anything political (which so much is anymore).  I know a lot of people will complain about the new system (myself included for parts of it, no doubt).  But bottom line is that it is a free service that a newspaper really has no obligation to provide.  It does add value to the website, and does generate more clicks, but I suspect the actual monetary value to the business is pretty small.  And probably more than eaten up in administration/moderation/software costs.  Just be aware that despite the complaining, many of us out here truly do appreciate that comments are still allowed.  In the mean time, I hope Civil works out.  I also hope they improve the navigation system over time as right now it's pretty bare-bones.  But it appears to be a newly developed system so maybe in a year or two it will improve.

Still, I am curious as to what happens to a pipeline after it is """"pigged"""" and some non-corrosive fluid left in it. I'm guessing that the fluid is probably some type of hydrocarbon, and although I've seen pipes  coated  with asphalt or some type of plastic or paint on the outside ( not fun to weld), they must eventually rust through from the outside even if the fluid absorbs water inside. That would let the pigged pipe leak eventually, would it not - even if it takes 100 years?

It is not surprising that people from that area and those close to them are enraged and seek retaliation in whatever manner possible, however horrible. Instead of weaponry we should be spending the money on fairly estimating who is causing the problems; authoritarian states propped up by western governments,and spend the money earmarked for even more weapons on healthcare, education.. citizens of the west as well as the east are far more threatened by the lack of these services than they are from terrorism.

The gov't agencies fine people/contractors for spilling dirt into a river but whole houses are okay? Who's going to pay to clean up that mess which could have been avoided in the first place?  The Musial's home is worth protecting and saving. I've always admired how nicely they kept it up. I can't believe those in power are just going to sit on their hands and watch it fall into the river.
