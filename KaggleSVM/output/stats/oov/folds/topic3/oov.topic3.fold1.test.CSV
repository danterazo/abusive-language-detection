0,"Thanks, but this story covered it better with less slant either way. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/31/trump-calls-for-lower-drug-prices-fewer-regulations-in-meeting-with-pharmaceutical-executives/?utm_term=.8fad2321608d  My source doesn't always include the actual dates of the news it's reporting.
"
1,"They sure whine about how hard life in the US is for them, probably because they are emulating their idiot leader trump.
"
0,"Pierre Trudeau was born in 1919. He was 19 years old when Canada entered war with Germany and was 26 when the war ended. Although he was of prime military age, Trudeau avoided serving in the war just as Donald Trump avoided serving in the Vietnam  War. The analogy is not false.

0,"These e-mails exist because she made them, it does not matter how they come to light, it does however matter she was Secretary of State and used an unsecured personal server.....then tried in many ways to destroy their existence, even after being ordered to hand them over.   This attempt to go after Russia by the limp Obama, and now all this 'outrage' at Comey is laughable.   She and only she is responsible for the plight she found herself in during the election.  The media dug up any nasty they could on Trump and proudly tried to outdo each other to take him down.....where is all the outrage over the depths they went to?
"
1,"RangerMC, Yup, Geert Wilders is a scourge on humanity.  Unfortunately, it appears that Trump may be channeling him.  Wilders, described as anti-Muslim, has pledged to ban Muslim immigration to the Netherlands.  Trump has pledged to do the same for the US.  Wilder, talking about Moroccan immigrants said, """"Not all are scum, but there is a lot of Moroccan scum...""""  Trump called Mexican immigrants """"rapists"""" and """"criminals"""" before saying that """"some are good people.""""  Trump is the American Geert Wilders, and that's why Doug Chin is taking action against his racist immigration policies.  You ask when there will be a positive story about the Trump administration.  The answer is when the Trump administration does something positive.
"
0,"""""hateful speeches before the Boy Scouts and Suffolk County Police Department""""??? Just give one statement from Trump that was """"hateful"""". Thought so.

0,"I can just imagine those ongoing negotiations between Ryan, McConnell and Trump.  Ryan - The House just voted to make 23 million lose their health care coverage by 2026. Trump - sound great - let's go with that! McConnell - oh no - just hold on there a Kentucky second.  I'll see your 23 million and raise you....well I don't know much I'll be raising you.  The CBO will tell me next week. Trump - sounds even better - but wait - the billionaires in my Cabinet and my new billionaire Ambassadors to Canada and the UK are clamouring for an even bigger tax cut.  Can you guys try to get it to 30 million in honour of Independence Day?  Stay tuned ... more to come next week
"
0,"I for one am glad the current Senate majority have settled the issue.  The compromise in the previous majority was not to invoke the nuclear option in exchange for a promise in stopping the constant filibusters. The promise didn't really stand up. When the balance swings back the deck can be stacked the other way without regard to the 60 votes necessary to confirm a SCOTUS appointee.  For almost a year after the death of Justice Scalia, found dead in queer and secretive circumstances at a remote cult-like retreat, the new senate majority refused to consider any nomination.  Now running this nomination through the democratic process like a speeding train and resulting in a train wreck.  Well Trumpkins, lets see where the yellow brick road leads....

"
1,"When in doubt, shout """"edited!""""  """"I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs. (Saying polygraph with a slight laugh)""""  This is not edited. This sentence means that she knew full well that he raped a little girl but he passed a polygraph test.. And she laughs it off.  I think what trump said in these videos is really stupid.. but I'm not voting on who is the more politically correct.. Especially from something that happened over 10 years ago. I remember myself from 10 years ago. I woulda slapped that kid.
"
0,"Oh my goodness.  I wasn't joking when I told friends if this past election ended up Trump vs. Sanders, I wouldn't vote for President.  Can we have somebody besides 70-something-year-old children who can gain popular support for the office?  It says something about the sad state of the electorate.
"
0,"why not post Donald's exact words to that effect? Let's see the quote, not the one in your mind, mind you Let me help you Brad: “The traditional way, if you look at President Obama and other presidents ― most of them didn’t make calls. A lot of them didn’t make calls. I like to call when it’s appropriate, when I think I’m able to do it,” Trump said. “They have made the ultimate sacrifice, so generally I would say that I like to call. I’m going to be calling them. I want a little time to pass.” Now where did Trump single out Bush? I read him singling out Barry but it's and some other President's who was in his mind at the time.  I'm not a mind reader.
"
0,"And Trump may not already even have a copy...
"
0,"[Why is it every time something comes out of the White House it is always by an unidentified source?] Do you really have to ask that question?  You don't think there wouldn't consequences for going """"on the record"""" especially given Trump's pursuit of leaks?
"
0,"CNN should fire Acosta and put Sarah Murry on the Whitehouse beat. She enjoyed a good relationship with President Trump during the campaign, and reported facts dutifully.  Acosta is just a hatchet man.
"
0,"Yet, Macron is a centrist which is more akin to a run of the mill old school republican than a Liberal Dem who are definitely not centrist, so obviously you are mistaken. He is a business man like Trump, not a social avenger like your democrats. Whereas he is not like trump, he's closer to Don than say, a Hillary. Oh and it's France and this is normal for them...
"
0,"KgT I think it pleases the alt right, like President Trump, to imagine themselves as perpetual victims. At the very least that allows them to justify violence and hate as a means of """"setting matters right"""".
"
0,"I was raised in a Republican family that hated Roosevelt, although considered Truman acceptable. In the '60s I was reading the National Review and had joined the Young Americans for Freedom. I was a Goldwater fan and volunteered during the '64 campaign. However, by the late '60s I found that the John Birch Society had become a significant part of the Republican Party and after reading their publications and talking with them, I started to think that something was wrong. Gradually, I started leaning towards the Libertarians, but as I learned more about that I concluded they was almost as flawed as the """"Birchers"""". The only route remaining was to become an independent that voted for the individual. Last year I supported Sanders, but ended up voting for Clinton because Trump was so obviously totally unqualified. Today, I still do not understand why people can support Trump. He is obviously a seriously flawed person who is unfit for the job he has obtained. Resist.
"
0,"Well gee, he could have appointed someone else AG and Deputy AG, couldn't he? We have to assume this is what Trump wants. The buck stops at his office.
"
0,"""""The CIA has concluded with 'high confidence"""" that Russia sought to influence the US election on behalf of Trump.""""  The US political establishment is starting to tread on very dangerous ground, and Obama is one of the instigators.  I agree that any democratically elected government needs to be assured that no foreign government, or other party, actually succeeded in manipulating and/or changing an election result.  However, I am not sure that this will be proven without any doubt as the result of this investigation.  And so, without spelling it out in so many words, where could this take the US, the 2016 Presidential election result and the electoral college decision.
"
0,"Simply b/c Carson sold out his principles for a job in government...and he even didn't get any job which he knows something about. Anyway just remember the rich ruler...what was his fate???  That anyone can defends Carson view on Trumps statements...is beyond me. I can only say that's not what my parents told me and what the Bible tells me God will/would accept. We have to stand up for God...and defend His level of conversation...not fall down to mans interpretation of what the word tells us to defend.
"
0,"Trump is proof of that.
"
0,"The problem is that there are no media outlets that will objectively analyze Trump's rationale for implementing the ban. Trump claims that he is implementing the ban due to """"medical costs"""" after consulting with generals.  If it's true that transgender people impose an extraordinary medical cost on the military, then the rationale is sound. It would be the same rationale for not allowing grossly overweight people into the military. I'd like to see a media organization perform an objective analysis on this, but an objective analysis by most media orgs, especially the left of center ones, is next to impossible. The media is too busy selling fear, emotion and anti-Trumpism to bother with facts.

0,"Unfortunately, in the current circumstances visiting the White House is an endorsement of Donald Trump and his ugly, divisive, bullying behaviour.
"
0,"Trump’s Presidency is a disaster in the making. It’s not just financial instability — but also the military, social, political and world order — that is at risk. Americans will feel the brunt of the ensuing chaos, but the global community will also suffer at the hands of a man ill-suited to the task of leadership at any level.  For the vast majority, Trump’s election has dashed hope for the future. Even many of the minority that voted for the narcissistic blowhard are having second thoughts as to the choice that they made. Collective trauma has now set in as Americans and the world community prepare for a very rough ride over the next four years and beyond.

"
0,"We will miss the Obama's when compared to the Trump oddities, but compared to what might have been and what was promised. Not really.  The Obama administration  said they would change the American financial and banking system to ensure the criminal negligence and with-criminal-intent actions of brokers and bankers and investment and banking houses, which nearly destroyed the American and world economies, and has made the taxpayers foot the bill for financial chicanery, would be fixed, and the guilty dealt with.  Not a single stockbroker or investor of banker or investment house or bank has received so much as a censure, a fine, or imprisonment for their crimes, and there has been nothing done to ensure the whole mess doesnt happen again.  Robert Reich, the Clinton Secretary of Labor, had an interesting op ed piece. Well worth reading: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/democrats-working-class-americans-us-election  Hope and Change. Not so much. And not really.

It's not nice to tell a giant voting block that you're going to keep their relatives out of the good old U.S. of A by, laughably, building a wall.  Now who was the Republican president that said, """"Mr. Gorbachov tear down the wall.""""
"
0,"Obama spent 8 years doing nothing. The only reason Trump hasn't gotten more done in his first few months is because the government is full of cowards who can't handle radical change. The American Mainstream Media has also tossed any semblance of objectivity and has become part of his official opposition.
"
0,"Steve:  if you are going to opine, you owe it to your readers to describe the facts accurately. 1). There is another way to amend the Constitution that bypasses Congress.  Unlikely? Maybe.  But perhaps it would be more likely to succeed than going through Congress. 2).  Trump hasn't been elected by the Electoral College yet.  That won't happen until the 19th.  Don't get ahead of yourself. 3) The Constitution makes no provision for a popular vote for President.  If you don't believe me, I invite you to read the document for yourself. Article 2 Section 1 (as modified by the 12th Amendment) is a good place to start.  You will note the part about Electors being chosen by the state legislatures.   No popular election is required.  I'll bet that most who read this don't know this simple fact. Perhaps if more people would take an hour to actually read the document...and insist it be followed...we would all enjoy better governance.  What say you?

"
0,"Oh man...  The measure accuses Trump of obstruction of justice and seeking to “use his authority to hinder and cause the termination” of an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, including “through threatening, and then terminating, James Comey.”   So they're still using the """"memo"""" as a basis for... anything?  They still think that Trump went and threatened Comey in February after the FBI publicly cleared Flynn in January?  Is that really their strongest case against Trump?
"
0,"You can't make up how ludicrously dangerous and unprecedented this relationship between the Russian dictator and the incoming POTUS is folks, especially given the consensus of all 17 of our Intelligence Agencies that the hacking was done to help trump get elected.

"
0,"Giving his supporters courage? Are you serious? Do you really think any of the people at the Values Voter Summit need encouragement? Do you imagine these people have been cowering in fear all this time waiting for somebody to give them permission to say 'Merry Christmas?' They probably say it all year round just to keep in practice!  Trump isn't giving anybody courage. All he's doing is preaching to the choir and stoking the anger of his base. It's his go-to pitch. They're going to do what they're going to do with or without his approval. And the rest of us are going to ignore him for the blowhard we already know he is.  As for your wife's fears, I can't speak to that. I'll just say that, for myself, while I'm not afraid to insult people, I don't go out of my way to do it just to prove a point about how fearless I am. I think that's called being a grown up.

0,"Mittens was a horrible candidate in 2012. He got trounced by Obama in the Electoral College 332 to 206. There is no way he could win in a three-way race with Clinton and Trump. Hillary would likely win all 50 states. So RUN Mittens, RUN!!!
"
0,"Mitchell Andrew wrote, """"Trump has never """"gone bankrupt"""". He owned companies that declared bankruptcy, under chapter 11.""""  You are correct, Trump protected his assets while repeatedly screwing both the public and the people he owed money to.  Like I said, the thought of the damage the Trump administration could cause is mind numbing.

0,"A good start for Trump's administration would be to remember """"Sundown Towns"""" along Route 66,  with a vow of """"Never Again"""".  Tax reform.  Best case estimates of any serious discussions, looks to be sometime in 2018.  So far, based on Trump's proposals, there's very little that will actually benefit those who need it the most, and that includes small business owners.  These small business owners  are people that lost all of their retirement accounts trying to keep their businesses afloat, who mortgaged their homes, worked more hours than they slept.  Currently, the wealthiest Americans stand to gain the most from the proposed tax reforms Trump has thus far talked about.  Frankly, does anyone out there believe in """"trickle down"""" economics, which history has taught us does not work.  We should all be for tax reform, that actually benefits those who need it the most.  Hold your Congressmen accountable.

"
0,"What is so unsettling about this process, is that Trump is actually moving at the speed of business, rather than the speed of politics. People are simply not used to seeing any form of government follow up so quickly on election promises. Normally, as Wynne and Trudeau demonstrate, time is allowed for the electorate to fall asleep after elections. And then, only then, proceed with policies and changes that reinforce re-election potential.  However, Trump is not a politician. He is used to being in control and making things happen quickly.  And like him or not, he's going to make the world a nervous place as he slowly learns from his mistakes. Painful as it is, he isn't 'business as usual'. And one other thing - with the latest firing, he isn 't going to tolerate non-performers. That too, is unsettling - especially for civil servants.  Ontario could actually benefit from that kind of leadership (yeah, right).

I misspelled that on purpose, Bubbles, no need to correct. Everyone who heard the tape could hear a 'put on' for Billy. The sad fact is, Trump was joking about the 'reality' that  is  Hollowood of today. He apologized for his 'words' Now to the 'allegations'. People who have a little more intelligence than a rock could see that  these 'allegations', coming out all at once, as if on 'cue' right AFTER the 'Billy' tape comes out, were highly 'questionable'.  Clintonites, who are experts in the art of 'sexual  harassment' saw no problem encouraging this 'eruption' of 'allegations'.12 coming out at once.  Well, most of the electorate saw through the obvious smear at the time and the women all dropped their 'lawsuits'  Hmmm.

The FBI has no evidence that Russia successfully hacked President-elect Donald Trump's campaign or the Republican National Committee (RNC), Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Tuesday.  Testifying before Congress for the first time since Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8, Comey declined to answer a question about whether the FBI was investigating the possibility of links between Trump associates and Russia.

0,"inverse, your understanding and interpretation of current events leaves something to be desired. It is not President Trump's firing of James Comey that means anything (it was completely legal and in many ways justified). The so-called “fatal mistake” he made was telling Comey he should drop the investigation of Michael Flynn. Pressuring the FBI director in this manner IS a crime — otherwise known as “obstruction of justice.” You could be a small-town security guard or the President of the United States. The crime is treated the same — subpoenas are issued, charges are brought and the allegations are adjudicated in a court of law.

Rubio doesn't represent the aspirations of 2/3rds to 7/8ths of Cuban Americans.  Cuba has been dirt-poor for decades. The Cuban people will have to be careful not to sell their birthright out to billionaire developers of upscale resorts (several come to mind, such as Sheldon Adelson, Trump's campaign financer, as well as the Trump family itself), or Cuba will find itself in a pre-Castro situation with a few ultra-rich Batistas owning and controlling the island, and thugs controlling law and politics.

0,"To me, this is where the Trumpian approach fails, but also where exclusion of grandparents and grand children really hurts their argument.  The problem they try to address is terrorism.  I agree with dealing with terrorism.  DEAL WITH IT!  Vet each applicant for admission to the US carefully.  Really carefully.  Investigate. Question, Research.  Come up with identifying flags for terrorist tendencies that are objectively real, and check carefully for them.  BUT, don't assume that a person, by accident of birthplace or lineage, is a terrorist.    And, we cannot allow the executive to identify a single repugnant trait in one individual, or a group of individuals, and then PRESUME it as to all who share the same trait.  If so, whomever is in executive power at any given time need only assert a given action by a single individual is a """"national security"""" risk, and then apply it to an entire like nationality, or race, or religion, or gender.  That is the problem with the travel ban.

0,"This is the old predestination argument. Everything occurs as God says. By this argument, God plans everything and we are helpless. There is no freewill. God has chosen the Kim family to terrorize the North Koreans for well over half a century now. God chose Saddam Hussein and Bashar al Assad to gas their own people. God inspired Osama bin Laden to destroy the Word Trade Center. God planned the Holocaust, Hitler just carried out His Divine Will.  I do not accept this thinking.  Human beings have the capacity to change their world. Those who support Trump do so of their own volition, as do those who oppose him, and each are free to engage in the political sphere to aid or attempt to circumvent the president's agenda.  This country was founded by people who rejected predestination and the supposed Divine Right of Kings. If they had thought like the author of the above piece, we would not have an America. I am forever grateful as an American that they had greater minds than that.

0,"You are hysterical. Seriously find evidence of actual bigotry, xenophobia, sexism, or any other ism you leftist cry bullies hurl at Trump. All anyone can ever do is quote half of sentences out of context. Weigh that to the good Donald has done over the years for individuals of every stripe and anyone with eyes can see that Donald is not any kind of fascist. You disparage the people who suffered under actual oppression in Nazi Germany by comparing a major US presidential candidate to the Fuhrer.  Your feelings mean nothing. Reality does not conform to your child like emotions, and just because you can't control them doesn't mean we have to accommodate them. Bernie Sanders was in town not two weeks ago and he and his supporters were able to conduct their events unmolested. If you and yours can't show Trump the same respect it really shows who the actual authoritarians are in America today.

0,"In my opinion and at this time, I truly think that sexism had much to do with Hillary's defeat and racism had much to do with Trump's win. Yes the Americans  had probably enough with the Clintons, but even Sister Theresa could not win the USA. There is no comparison to Germany really. Germany has many socialist policies: healthcare, childcare and universal education in public schools, where their careers begin. Americans are not as advanced in their thinking; they do not grasp that, 'it takes a village'; they have never gotten over the Civil War; they are not into smart women--intelligent women still throw them off, and there is a possibility they do not believe in the equality of the sexes. Their education system is broken. It is sad that as a senior I will probably be long gone before we have equality of the sexes and even in my grand daughter's time there will be problems with this same issue. We are moving s-l-o-w-ly on this progressive thinking.

I am also confused about this: When there were no jobs where I was living and raising a family, I moved to where there were jobs.  What happened to ideas like that?  Did I do something wrong?

0,"Richard, on your statement that a fish rots from the head, I will totally agree with you and elaborate from my observations. A number of years ago, it seems that party leadership, having been hounded by the membership to make the process of becoming a candidate more easy, backed off their influence on the process and let everyone who wanted to, become a candidate.  Well, for a while that seemed to work, candidates were still by and large upright and proper citizens whom the party could get behind.  And then came Trump and Ms. Stenger to show the fallacy of removed party leadership in candidate vetting. I am totally putting the blame on the respective parties leadership in letting the situation spiral out to this illogical conclusion - letting a ranting crazy woman who thinks she is the reincarnation of God and Trump to actually be a legitimate candidate.  The people of Hawaii need to demand of it's political parties a better selection of candidates moving forward from this year.

There is no reason at all to even suspect that what's being written is remotely objective rather than playing to the audience of the typical G&M poster. There is not universal agreement that the Iran nuclear deal is great. The U.S. has defense treaties with Japan and South Korea. Americans are watching Kim lobbing missiles in the direction of the U.S., each one closer to the U.S. than the last one, capable of carrying a hydrogen bomb. Mr. Kim has vowed to destroy Guam and hit the U.S. as well. Canada, with virtually no international responsibilities for even peacekeeping, much less defending anyone, can't judge the U.S.

You're absolutely right that Trump's not an ideologue. I've been saying that for over a year on this site and elsewhere. Those who voted for him because they think he's ideologically conservative were suckered, plain and simple.  Trump isn't an ideologue, he's an opportunist. Both his domestic policy and his foreign policy are predicated on that alone, and there is no coherence to either. He hasn't changed his convictions because he never had any in the first place. He only had a posture and now he seems to be deciding that it's in his interests to form a new one.

Believe me, as someone who has worked in international development for many years, the Clinton foundation has a horrific reputation on the ground, and I don't know anyone (most of whom are super liberal so this is not a partisan concern) who would work for them. And her corruption is so out in the open now - you really can't deny it. I get the concern over Trump, but for myself the concern is equally there as relates to Clinton. I'm flabbergasted when people believe the allegations against her are because she is a woman. There is way too much proof to view this as some sort of misogynistic conspiracy.

At least liars recognize the difference, and care about the distinction, between truth and falsehood even if they choose the latter .

In the summer of 1974, Haig intervened when Nixon was suicidal, believing Nixon """"may take the whole world with him"""". Even doctors today are worried Trump """"isn't well"""". How did FDR get into the discussion with his radio addresses?  Trump when reading the teleprompter is not the real Trump.  The real Trump can be found when he starts """"ad libbing"""" his speeches.  Example.  Speaking about """"Charlottesville"""", he said there are """"many fine people on both sides, on both sides"""".  Neo-nazis, Ku Klux Klansmen on one side being opposed by people protesting hate groups on the other side.  A third grader knows there are no """"fine people"""" in hate groups such as the KKK, an avowed domestic terrorist group.

0,"Notice the suitcases and the clothing, these people are a far cry from the boat migrants and the Syrian refugees we took in. The Haitians have been living in the States for 6 years now, and had housing, jobs and their kids were in school. On a speculation of what Trump may do , and we all know how accurate that is, they have decided that Canada makes a nice second choice. The second choice idea is that they didn't have to stay in the States, but they did and they made a life for themselves there. Primarily this will become Montreal's problem as with the large Haitian population already there , it is likely they will stay there. However it would be nice if we could stop this false appeal that these are poor asylum seekers in need of shelter. They had shelter, they had food, they had jobs , they had access to education and medical care. These aren't people fleeing a war torn country which has been bombed into rubble. Our PM put out the welcome mat, and they are taking him up on his offer

So why did he try to lie to the American people by setting up Rosenstein as the ax man?  In addition, if getting """"the Russian thing"""" done right he could appoint a special prosecutor.  He could have tasked Rosenstein with finding the right replacement instead of fabricating a three page lie. These two things leads me to believe both of the reasons he's offered to the American people are lies and there might just be something damning in the FBI's investigations.  Of course, it's always possible that Trump just forgot to fire him a while ago and doesn't want to fess up about being a forgetful old man.  His tendency to distrust others doesn't help.

He's gone against the advisement of others who ostensibly know better too many times to say he had no choice.  I think, and its just my opinion, that Trump likes the idea of knowing what's in those files when no one else--or only a few others do.

However, his well-documented racist, xenophobic rants encourage and support strong feelings among his followers.  Combine those strong feelings with an unstable individual and very bad things can result.  IMO, all leaders across the political spectrum should be encouraging their followers to act non-violently.  I feel Mr. Trump has failed to support non-violence and, instead, acted in a fashion which (intended or not) promotes violence from his followers.  I find that disturbing and very sad.  Gary Crum

1,"The problem is similar though. They are serious about the separation of powers, and although I have very little knowledge of the US constitution, I believe that the president has to be impeached by Congress. Congress is controlled by the party he supposedly represents (reportedly because he thought Republicans were the only people stupid enough to vote for him). Although he was not the preferred candidate for most Republican members, they probably feel obliged to support him. The Obama presidency was unbearable for most of them and they see this as a period of redress. Many probably still believe that the claw back can be achieved by supporting Trump.

Those Conservatives love deficit financing, eh? A Conservative would have you believe that Trump's infrastructure spending sans carbon tax makes sense but Trudeau's infrastructure spending avec carbon tax is senseless.

It's a mode that fails to accord with what it calls for in others: empathy, tolerance, dialogue. It's the overheated strands of SJW rhetoric that actually helped Trump, dividing the left and creating a back lash. Consider Rorty's GENIUS prediction of the Trump movement: """"One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past 40 years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out.

The US attempts to arm and support rebel groups in Syria ended up helping ISIS install itself comfortably there too! Assad, like Saddam and Gadhafi, is awful but what are the viable alternatives? The Russians, also ruthless admittedly, saw that Assad was the only option to stabilise the country which was relatively advanced in some areas before this mess started.

The Sept. 16 email, recently obtained by Civil Beat, doesn’t specifically list the recipients, but it’s clear that it was tailored to those who are involved with Hawaii’s multi-billion-dollar visitor industry.

0,"Good and accurate column.  We know the Haitians will apply for refugee status.  The question is why.  Few are refugees.  They fled an earthquake and not the government.  Fleeing an earthquake is not grounds for refugee status.  Most will be refused refugee status yet they apply.  They apply because they have been counselled to do so.  They are not coming because Trump is ending the special measures for Haitians as we have already done that.  By applying they gain access to social services, health care, education and the right to work.  Because the refugee determination system is not resourced to handle such a large influx and there will be ample opportunities to appeal negative decisions  system will back up giving them years in Canada before they must leave.  Then we will hear the claims that it is inhumane to ask them to go home after they have been here for years.

Watkins asks where our morals are, forgetting that the Preamble to our Constitution states that an enumerated, special function of our government is to """"provide for the common defense."""" In this world where not all wish us peace---I suppose he would say that's our fault---providing for the common defense means having the best military, unless you'd be willing to have someone ELSE do it. . . which  Mr Watkins apparently would.

Indeed, in the USA, you're just as likely to hear the Right urge the suppression of liberal ideas. Ann Coulter wrote a book about it. Trump urged his followers to gang up on liberals.  Free Speech? Okay, so that explains why Harper put stuff through in so many omnibus bills. Why public discussions were rushed through in a few towns and on a tight schedule.

In this age of instant news, the only way to make money is by engaging your readers to give you instant feedback. Without this forum being available, any online newspaper edition becomes the equivalent of someone trying to sell you their political propaganda newsletter on a street corner. Secondly, The Toronto Star like all its cousin U.S. mainstream media (MSM), are in the process of financial freefall. The reason being, their overly biased news coverage against Trump in the end established a new meme called Fake News. The proof came to light via the MSM's poll numbers for Clinton and as a result, readers in droves began dropping their subscriptions. If The New York Times can't recover financially from this movement of the readers' revolt, how in hell does The Toronto Star expect they can do any better in gaining back paying subscribers?

Did you notice how in the last two weeks Hillary said she would bring us all together? Obama said the same thing, and then systematically drove a wedge between between us using race, money, health and a plethora of other issues. Hillary Clinton cut her own throat when at one rally the """"deplored"""" half of the Americans and at the next she adored them.  For all his vitriol, Trump won with the slogan """"Drain the swamp"""". As long as he works to that end, he will have my support.

Thankfully Trump will starve these cesspools of taxpayer funds that enables this fraud to continue.
"
1,"Trump doesn't have the gonads to face anyone one on one that may disagree with him, he's way too thin skinned. Proof is in the way he tried to ignore Jim Acosta of CNN the other day, the more Acosta pushed his question the more pissed and red faced this thin skinned buffoon became. He couldn't answer the question honestly without making himself look like the idiot that he truly is. That's why he uses Twitter, because it's a one-sided conversation and no one can question him or disagree with him. Kindergarten mentality.
"
0,"Not surprising. Trust depends a lot on.presenting your position in a factual way and then doing what you said you were going to do.

And that first Obama and now Trump spinelessly gave the Saudis a big old pass on that, just like we gave them a pass on their financial backing of the 9/11 hijackers, etc.?

No, this was an FU to the establishment, not just the political establishment, but the PC culture establishment, the hypocritical media and entertainment establishment, the liberal educational institutional establishment, the establishment that left behind middle income workers and middle income families, the I'm going to tell you how to think establishment, and finally an FU to the Clinton machine and its decades of questionable activities, murder and corruption.

0,"The NAFTA renegotiations will probably drag on into the summer of 2018 (the Mexican Federal election) and fall (US midterms).  This will make the political context in all 3 countries increasingly complex as it relates to NAFTA.  Increasingly many progressive Democrats are campaigning on a protectionist platform while centrist anti-Trump Republicans support NAFTA.  Thus, there will be no consensus in either US Party around which NAFTA debate can rise above the simplistic populist level.  Mexicans want a change of government and the NAFTA stance of the US fuels the left wing populist cause making the negotiating options of the current government increasingly narrow.  In the increasingly chaotic negotiating environment just described, our government likewise little room to manoeuvre, especially with a general election scheduled for 2019.  Increasing rhetoric and rigidity on all sides is likely.

Doubting that hacking never happened  becomes difficult, but certainly not out of the realm of reality.   When you couple that statement with zero evidence to even arrest an individual let alone try in a court of law,  reasonable doubt is not there.  Like I said I'm unsure either way but the rule of law means I have to presume innocence as there is no evidence of guilt, at least that you or I or any other commenter has seen. Certainly the media has not seen it either, but with the non stop articles on it you'd assume a jury is out for deliberation already with a shoe-in guilty verdict. Once again show me a shred of evidence.  This ties into Darcy comment further down why trump doesn't comment. Simple, because he is not in court and doesn't need to.  In my lifetime I've seen government get it wrong far more than they get it right.

She and Senator McCain believe that health care reform is so important that any reform should be subject to """"regular order"""", a deliberative and inclusive Senate process to openly air and vet the pros and cons of any new health care policy. Such policy developed in back rooms in Washington by a handful of same-party Senators with zero public visibility and with no inclusion of the opposition party is properly doomed to failure.

They are trying to get Senator McCain, who enjoys health insurance to cover his brain tumor, to come back to Washington to vote for legislation that ensures others do not.  Meanwhile, the Republicans have developed whatever they're working on in secret, with no transparency, no public hearings, and no Democratic input.  Yeah.  This should go well.

The services they provide are delayed, many times incorrect and they get to call the shots.  NOT US AS PATIENTS!  We pay a lot of money in taxes to support them, their expensive lifestyles and their god-like behaviour.  Why should we give them a tax break?  Pleeeeeease!!!! Want to move to the US?  Be my guest!  Let's see if Trump wants you (and allows it) now!!!  We sure have many foreign doctors coming to Canada that are just as prepared, capable and willing to take on those vacant jobs in a heartbeat and  can't today because the medical schools and boards have a lock on their professional schools so that no competition takes what they have monopolized for years.

You can even get rid of the border patrols, which cost money. 2.  Uphold the existing laws.  Ship the illegals back. 3.  No government programs for illegals.   Simple.

0,"This is a difficult dilemma.  Much of the conflict moving forward in the future will be in the cyber realm.  As wired as the US is, a well coordinated cyber attack could be as effective as an all-out military assault.  So do we take our cyber weapons away from the government while other countries develop theirs?  Trump wants to spend an additional trillion dollars on our enormously bloated military budget.  But the next major war is far more likely to be fought with bits and bytes, not with firepower.  Military drones and mortars can be used against American citizens just as easily as against enemies.  The reason they aren't is that we have strong civilian control over the military (at least for now).  Eliminating our cyber defensive capabilities is idiotic.  What we need to figure out is how to prevent them from being used against Americans.

0,"I for one agree with this article. I have listened to various Trump advisors as well as Trump himself, and they clearly have no understanding of trade flows and what a VAT is (they consider a VAT on an import to be the same as a tariff). Hopefully someone with knowledge will be allowed a 60 minute presentation to this group to give them knowledge. For our part as Canadians that is up to Ms. Freeland. We will not be spared these policies. Those who think we can easily withstand a 10% disadvantage on our exports to the US are dreaming. Our economy is driven by exports to the US. Our consumption is satisfied by imports from the US and other countries. With less exports will come less imports and a lower standard of living for all of us. Our government must quietly cozy up to this new administration and gently explain the facts of economics to them. For one I encourage the Liberals to get a plan for this most urgently. It is the single biggest threat we are facing right now.

Having grown up with Christian values I struggle to figure out how someone that is the embodiment of so many of the Seven Deadly Sins(Trump) is being written off as righteous and telling it how it is, while those that actually give are called out as global elitist.

You logic is clearly judge people as guilty until charged rather than innocent until found guilty. Maybe you should reconsider your stance on the responsibilities of the president then ask yourself if Trump has committed any injustices to women since he became the president ( 2 days ago).   Keeping someone on your radar is a smart thing to do for sure but to charge them with a crime based on the fear that they may commit. It is scary. Again... all presidents take the same oath of office and are held to the same standards. We all knew Bill Clinton had a past with women but it didn't become an issue until it was one.

In the case of Same-sex Marriage or Abortion - we are really talking about peoples' opinions - often based on religion, morality, ethics - whatever.

Climate Change is reputed to have a """"consensus"""" that humans are causing a warming planet. By it's definition a consensus means there are other views - but they too are denied and shouted down. The words """"consensus"""" and """"science"""" don't belong together. Science is about Hypotheses, experimenting, analysis and conclusions. The hypothesis was that temperatures rise with an increase in CO2.

Look at George Conway's tweets on Trump-- pointing out how they weaken his case and calling the situation of Sessions, the SGO, and the Justice Department doing a good job and getting stabbed in the back and insulted by Trump, """"sad"""".

Protestants and catholics have chose different sides sometimes but i dont know of any precedents on banning an immigrant based on religion.

We have one party government control at the moment.  As badly as the GOP is currently performing, I'm sure that changes in 2018.

This is how all advanced economies grew strong, by protecting our own industries until they can compete, Canada has been too hooked on the globalisation drug and our supposed """"special relationship"""" to the US to pursue our own interest.

Obama said: “The American people rightly remember what we as a country accomplished in bringing to justice somebody who killed over 3,000 of our citizens,” he said. “And it’s a mark of the excellence of our intelligence teams and our military teams, a political process that worked. And I think for us to use that time for some reflection, to give thanks to those who participated, is entirely appropriate, and that’s what’s been taking place.”  Biden and Bill Clinton laud the president. I'm not so naive that I think they did it without Obama's assent, but it's a far more modest approach than Trump would use.  I certainly misunderstood your position.

0,"1/2 <<Barrack Obama argued precisely for this role in his first campaign.>> No, he didn't. Then-Senator Obama did point out that the United States had fought two wars which the Congress neither approved nor paid for; he did pledge to extract the United States from them. But: he did not disparage our allies, weaken our alliances, or suggest that the United States should withdraw from a leadership role in the community of nations. He did not praise and cozy up to dictators, despots and """"strong men."""" In 2008, Barack Obama had more political experience than Donald Trump had in 2016, but not a lot more. What really distinguishes Obama 2009 from Trump 2017 is that Obama came to the presidency as a student of history, politics and government; in short, Obama brought competence to the job.

So what! The problem is the COST and the government can't afford to spend $1000/mo on people's health care. Health care is unaffordable for anyone making under a million bucks a year. If even the upper middle class can't afford something, then the government can't afford it either. Insurance never ever makes anything cheaper in the aggregate.  The problem is things like $3000 MRIs that should cost $100 or less, like in *other* first world nations. How it's financed is irrelevant.

1,"It's no longer """"Obamacare."""" It is, in fact, the American national healthcare system.  It is outrageous for the President to threaten to sabotage that system, depriving millions of their healthcare and undoubtedly sending many Americans to an earlier death, in order to advance his non-existent alternative plan.  Trump has no grasp of healthcare policy and was completely useless during the Republican healthcare debacle. His incoherent, rambling  and self-contradictory sound bites about healthcare exposed him as intellectually lazy and willfully ignorant. At critical times, he was watching television, playing golf, attending a parade in Paris, or fueling territorial battles between members of his incompetent staff. Senate Republicans were probably relieved to see him otherwise occupied, although his absence wasn't enough for them to pass a bill that was so awful that they tried to exact a promise from Paul Ryan that the House wouldn't pass it, something Ryan was unwilling to do.

As I wrote earlier, I dislike people who falsely claim military honors they didn't earn, or get. Blumenthal served in the military, he should have kept it to that.

The results found 37% of the public knows that the uninsured rate has gone down, while 31% believe it’s gone up, and 32% believe it’s stayed the same.  But look closer and predictable partisan divisions emerge: a plurality of Democrats believe, accurately, that more Americans have health insurance, while a plurality of Republicans believe the opposite.

The infrastructure lie is simply Trump's plan to privatize public works in order to bleed public money to support his interests.  And balancing the budget?  Trump's budget plan literally destroys the Treasury. .  Trump's propaganda and lies aren't reality.  .

It is also amusing to see how most web-commentors are apparantly on the high-road of maturity but have resorted to the exact same behaviour as they purport to despise...

0,"some real howlers in this commentary.  the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result  It's been over 15 years since it became clear Pakistan  was not the reliable ally the Pentagon claimed it to be. Now the author expects that more pressure on Pakistan will achieve  a win.  There are other states that could serve US needs such  as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan but those relationships have not been nurtured.  Then the author claims neither Iran or Russia can be counted on to support  intervention. Gee you think? Could it be  because  Trump was pressured reluctantly to slap more sanctions on  Russia and take a hard line on Iran to boot..  A cogent analysis would  recognize these constraints  and that America has few countries they can count on in the region and  then suggest that maybe these two be  brought on board. Trump tried that of course with Russia but the push back from entrenched interests was immense.  Canada stay well clear.

What if the Trumpists decided that developing North American energy autarky was the way out of middle east energy arrangements and entanglements? Canadians have always bristled at having to import oil for our eastern half of the country while the western half exports it all to the US.  What if we could achieve """"Energy East"""" with an energy arrangement that treated the Canadian and US pipeline arrangement as one, using energy autarky as our base?  Our courting of China in the oil and natural resources sector to """"diversify"""" our economy is little more than an invitation to build Chinese dependency within our own borders using free trade agreements as the tool.  Dealing with China gives Canada the illusion of sovereignty, but it is in reality just a cat playing with a mouse. This mouse is much safer with an elephant than a cat.

The reason America is the only country not to join the ICC is because of the slaughter of 100 million Natives so the European immigrant aliens could steal and murder their way across America. World War 2 was the last war forced on us, everything else has been to lend Americas name to invasions for legitimacy while white collar thieves and murderers could profit off what is not theirs... By the way.. Why did those Saudi Arabian and Egyptian terrorists attack on 9/11, and why did America invade Afghanistan and Iraq instead?. Why didn't America invade Saudi Arabia and Egypt instead?

No good choices.   I blame it, at least partially, on the closed (members only) primary election design.   It a rule that defends the elite over the public.  The other part is which candidate will attract the most money.     The Party gives lip service to voters, but bows to the potential millions that fund their campaigns.  The Trump campaign saw those 'lost' voters(across party lines) and made a great choice to talk to people who in most years are never courted by The Party.

""""incredible"""" - adjective: impossible to believe.  The frequency of Spicer's use of these words is clearly influenced by Trump, who sprinkles his remarks with them.  It's telling that they are cuing listeners that what they are saying should not be believed.  An unconscious admission that they are lying.

A flawed poll.

When Trudeau, McKenna, Suzuki, et alia say that carbon dioxide is a pollutant, they are telling a big fat lie.

0,"RE """"He gave them an easy fantasy by suggesting that all their jobs would return and their communities would be suddenly reinvigorate"""" Of course he did because Trump is first and foremost a good sales guy, and good sales guys succeed by first identifying and telling their buyer what they want to hear.  Trump's goal was simply to win with any means possible, and there is no doubt that his appeal to the fears and prejudices of his based worked.  Trump's widely acknowledged propensity to change his position on a whim gives him an unusual amount of wiggle room for whatever policies his administration decides to pursue.  He might decide to continue Obamacare with minor fixes, recommend left-leaning Supreme Court nominees, and maintain Obama's foreign policy, all under the guise of a """"new"""" Trump direction, and his base would still love him and the GOP Congress could not object.  I just watched Obama and Trump together at the White House...encouraging interaction.

0,"Trump and his merry band of plutocrats are ill equipped to govern because running a country is not like being the CEO of a corporation. It’s important to remember that government is not a business. The purpose of government is not to show a profit. It is to achieve the common good. Trump and his cabinet are political anarchists. They are carting boxes of explosives into government agencies to blow up any program that promotes the common good and impedes corporate profit. Trump needs to learn about what it means to lead a democracy.

0,"The news and ads from AARP are misleading and not letting the America people know what is really going on with health care reform. Essentially, Obamacare was a ponzi scheme set up to force young healthy American's to pay for expensive health care for the older generations. What Obama didn't bargain for was that young people were smarter than him and none of them signed up for the healthcare, instead they took a risk that they might get a fine from the federal government. So, you've got a system going bankrupt because young people wised up. Now, you older people, since you are the ones needing health care, you need to be paying for it, not expecting young people to foot the bill for you. Baby Boomers are the richest American's yet, more affluent than any other generation. There will never be a generation as well off as you all, future generations will have it much more difficult. Vote for Trump's healthcare and stop saddling young people with more expenses on top of rising student loans

Trump has already exacerbated issues with North Korea (the least the President should do in such a complex international issue is not jump on political land mines with two feet and then contradict his world ambassador, the Secretary of State, at every corner).

The test failed. Here's a quote from the Atlantic...  """"But a coalition of Democrats and newly-elected Republicans overrode his veto of legislation to raise $1.2 billion in revenue by hiking personal income taxes and repealing a widely-criticized exemption for small-business owners. Tax rates will now go up to levels near where they were before Brownback took office.""""  States can't operate in deficit like the feds can.

In 1949 the Chinese Nationalists fled to the island and failed to let the communists take over, and since then it has become a democracy, unlike the mainland which is more like a kleptocracy with a massive military. The size of its military lets it behave like a big bully, and by comparison over the years the USN has far less power than it did in 1949. That's why the One China Policy is possible. but the Japanese have as much a claim to Formosa as the Chinese do. Mr. Trump knows his history, which is a problem for the Chinese.

What evidence do you have to justify your comment?  With regard to expediting the process, you must know that the allegations of collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia started 15 months ago in July 2016.  The allegations have been investigated by the best U.S. intelligence agencies the world has ever known, by several Congressional committees and, since March 2017, by Special Prosecutor Mueller.  Not a shred of evidence has been produced to support the allegations in 15 months.   The charges from Mueller’s investigation to be announced tomorrow could change that, but I do not believe the charges will have anything to do with the alleged collusion.  They may get Manafort for alleged money laundering and Mike Flynn for failing to dot and “i” or cross a “t” on some government form, but not much else.

Answer: Financial markets expect higher corporate profits -- stemming from lower corporate taxes, fewer regulations, and major infrastructure spending. Question: But what about Trump’s talk about new trade barriers, and executive orders barring immigration? Won’t these reduce corporate profits? Answer: Wall Street doesn’t believe he’ll follow through on erecting new trade barriers. And his executive orders on immigration affect such a small portion of the workforce they won’t reduce profits.

As others have said here, Trump shoots himself in the foot constantly with his ill-advised tweets that show us what he really thinks, to say nothing of his bizarre actions (like his sycophantic cabinet meeting this week - my God that was scary).

Elitist Establishment types like McLachlin and the G & M are of the latter type. Because the Establishment is under attack from the right and the left and the Canadian government is disliked by the right and the left, elitists like McLachlin are doubling down on the defense of their turf. Since the rise of Trump, all we're reading here are attacks on Donald Trump or peons to the Establishment status quo.

I am very disappointed with the USA and I believe that their behaviour over the past 15 years has been appalling. The thought that such a powerful country could elect Donald Trump beggars disbelief.  As to your question as to who is Presidential; that is a very difficult question to answer as we are not seeing a lot of good leadership. I think that you have to look at the Scandinavian countries for good leadership that benefits the citizens of those countries.  I think that Putin is dangerous and is hardly a great President. He inherited a basket case after Yeltsin and I suppose much like Africans, the older Russians are responding to his """"big man"""" style of leadership. Obama tried hard to turn the USA into a more caring society but the Rambo culture seems to be too deeply ingrained.  I suppose that leaves us with Zuma!

Comey leaked privileged information, using government resources, to a friend outside government in order to influence appointment of a special counsel.

1,"<To be perfectly clear, I wasn't painting 'all Trump supporters' the same.> I don't think you were unclear.  This is a typical deflection by people who don't want to, or can't, deal with what you did say. Trump built his campaign on the racist drivel of birtherism.  His base has always consisted of  gullible, superstitious and racist birthers. These are the people who, as Trump put it, would stand by him even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York.  These are the people Clinton described as """"deplorable"""" and you describe as """"despicable.""""  Trump could not and did not win with only his base, but he also could not have won without them.  Steve Bannon, first as campaign manager and now as chief strategist, is Trump's guarantee to his racist base that even as Trump occasionally pays lip service to people who are not in his base, he remains faithful to the racism and bigotry on which he built his campaign and which continues to the the life force of his base.

In these discussions I'm hearing a lot of doubts expressed about Trump's ability to pick good leaders and make good decisions. That's primarily left-leaners who see things changing and mourning that their candidate lost. What gives me hope is that Trump is CEO of a complex and profitable $11B corporation. He didn't get there by being stupid and over the years he has developed a keen skill for evaluating people for their leadership abilities and putting them in positions where they can develop and deliver both growth and profits. So it will be interesting seeing how quickly and severely his management style conflicts with the entrenched bureaucracy and how much change he is actually able to drive. He has outlined an aggressive 100-day plan that I think is going to surprise a lot of bureaucrats by how quickly it knocks their ivory towers out from under them.

But I think you may have discounted the role of the common man.  I do not believe I have ever seen the left so mobilized in their common dislike of a leader.  The typical in-fighting and splintering due to special interests is more or less absent.  And Trump's approval numbers are historically low for a new president.  Without that popular disapproval, neither the deep state nor the fourth estate would be as successful in moderating Trump's positions on issues.

Voters must recognize that if he has to be someone other than who he really is in order to win, and if he can't sustain that pretense during the campaign, then if he is elected he will revert to his true self, with no restraint and little constraint.

The only military option is for the U.S. to attack NK alone. Because SK and Japan will not join, and SK will not initiate war. If U.S. does attack it will 1) cause a devastation and bloodshed greater than Vietnam War for NK, SK, Japan and the U.S. itself'; 2) will lose military alliance with SK and Japan; 3) will trigger a military response from China and Russia (this is confirmed officially by them). It will trigger WW3. And thus all U.S. assets around the world will be subject to  attack.  Faced with this, Trump talks, yell and threaten. This is all he can do. Besides, U.S. Navy in Asia Pacific is currently in one holy mess.

They didn't even retract these claims until 5 months later when Trump started tweeting about them.  Not even Brett was able to tell this was fake news even though I basically walked him through the issue from start to finish (I'm talking about the """"17 intelligence agencies"""" narrative).  I explained to him that if he actually read the report in question he could see for himself that it is not, in fact, signed off by 17 intelligence agencies.

0,"Sarcasm aside, Trump's plan to privatize the FAA would make it unlikely to spend huge sums of money to improve a runway at an airport that isn't an important airline destination. A private for-profit FAA will get its funding mostly from the airlines. One of the expected outcomes of FAA privatization is the further restriction of airline access to community airports given  service into most of them runs at a loss. It'll also be a likely burden on general aviation. But, they'll have happier big airline customers.  The FAA today sometimes acts in the interest of the public and not the airlines. It's in their charter to do so. But not so with a private FAA which is trying to make a profit.  I can already hear the new ATC dialog:  ATC: """"Understand you need an expedited departure clearance?"""" Pilot: """"Roger. Also a direct climbout to FL350, please.""""

And while I am not a fan of CNN, they have done a great job of reporting on the inadequate Federal response by FEMA and the territorial government there. If anyone is guilty of making this crisis political, it has been Trump and not Mayor Cruz.

If you're an American you bear responsibility to all the injustice the world has ever seen and ever will see and you should hate yourself for that  and those who don't hate themselves are reviled and disdained. That kind of self-hate leads to them hating others as well,  just  like you said Gene, as people will naturally project on to others how they feel about themselves.   They need to start liking themselves first, before they can start liking others. That would go for Sid as well as anyone who has extreme anger over Trump.

Not knowing anything about the conflict in Syria pretty much eliminates Johnson as a vote-worthy candidate. Hillary would be terrible for AK continuing the policies of locking up more federal lands.

By 2020 they will sell only electric vehicles and hybrids and by 2025 only electrics. Even on a coal grid an electric vehicle produces around 30% less CO2 than an internal combustion engine (because the engine is far more efficient than an ICE, and on top of that, a coal plant is nearly 3 times as energy efficient as an ICE). Today France announced that it will ban all fossil fuel based vehicles by 2040 and be fully carbon neutral by 2050. This adds one of the largest economies in Europe and the sixth largest on earth to the list that are making serious efforts.

It is true that Trump has told lies about his past, like claiming his first wife, a competitive skier, was an Olympian, but he has never given the impression that he was delusional, as Hillary Clinton consistently did. Her lies about her life history went back to her infancy, when she claimed she was named after the New Zealand mountaineer, who didn’t conquer Everest until years later. She lied about dodging sniper fire at Tuzla airport in Bosnia, long after the Bosnian War had ended, even though her account was clearly contradicted by newsreels taken of the event. As Robert Fulford wrote, she seems to suffer from mythomania, a pathological tendency to create myths about herself.

Not because they think he can win, but because they want the Democratic nominee to face the weakest possible candidate. I believe this is exactly how Amy Demboski made it to the runoff in the last mayoral election.  Amy's support surged in the week prior to the election.  Many attributed it to her well reported armed confrontation (she didn't brandish, don't freak out) of a sign vandal.  I don't think so - with polling showing Ethan would easily be in the top two, many D's calculated that Demboski was the preferred candidate because a large number of Republicans wouldn't support her in a runoff.  In political circles this is referred to as Rat****ing.  The only difference is that D's and Independents didn't have to change party affiliation to vote in the municipal election.  I personally thought that Coffey or Halcro would make fine mayors, but they didn't pass the CPT (Conservative Purity Test).

Well over 90+% of economists - from the left and the right - say income inequality (lots of poor people having nothing and a very few very rich having everything), is generally caused by a lack of progressive taxation, and is to blame.  That's one reason UBI (Universal Basic Income- a no strings attached check for $1000-$2500 a month for every citizen, was thought up by the right wing/Chicago School of Economics).  Lower taxes = more inequality, more poor people, more homeless, more societal instability, more.... you get the idea.  It's simple math, really.  However, facts aren't all that important in this discussion.  It's mostly about belief.  Actually, it's all about belief.  Regardless of the proof that higher taxes make for a better society, the right will cling to its beliefs, ignoring the math, and the facts, as large chunks of society flow down the proverbial drain.

He will choose to blame his own body.  Doing so may also spare his administration by leaving Pence and Trump's appointees in place, before enough proof is found of Russian collaboration with the Trump campaign to invalidate the election on the basis of fraud and treason.

Being poorly informed and largely racist, a large minority voted successfully for a individual - a demagogue who made ridiculous promises and spoke their language of hate. This is less likely to happen with more choices where the parties MUST co-operate to achieve anything constructive. After decades of obstruction from the fascists, this election has given them carte blanche to finish the looting of the American economy and its productive capacity. In the end, government will only exist to subsidize the wealthy and their corporations and protect them in their gated communities.

Bannon's commitment to undoing American values  drew him to Trump as a Useful Idiot.  If Trump didn't know that Bannon held him in utter contempt (and he probably didn't, given his massive and fragile ego), he was the only one who didn't know.  How Bannon treats Trump going forward will depend to a great extent on what he, Bannon, discerns is the best strategy for destroying the United States.  If that means attacking Trump, he'll do that; if that means attacking the people around Trump, he'll do that.  I think he's likely to try the latter strategy first in an attempt to leave the idiot standing.  Supposedly Bannon is going back to Breitbart.  He never left.

Qatar is not a supporter of ISIS, but has supported other groups that are fighting ISIS but but like many groups including those that are supported by the US include Jihadists. The Saudis as much as Qatar have supported or nurtured terrorists that have attacked the US-- like the 9-11 terrorists and Al Quaeda. Statements like Trump's feed the Russians.

Nobody voted for Sanders in the election because Sanders wasn't on the ballot in the election (you do understand how primaries work in America right ?).  And even if anybody had, it wouldn't be 43% - since Trump and Clinton between them got 98% of all the votes cast. The others simply didn't vote. The turn-out was lower than average - but not by very much. It's extremely rare for America to get more than 30% of eligible voters to actually show up.

What I don't understand why anything that Trump has said, (we know he has done nothing politically), would improve the situation.   He's profited from the current system of tax's, donated money to both parties, (including Ms. Clinton) and has certainly been found lying more times than you can shake a stick at.    Trump has zero experience in the industry you think he will reform?  It makes no sense.  You may vote as you wish of course Unknown.    I'll cancel your vote, you'll cancel mine.   Trump will return to his gold palace appartment and relax with an expensive bottle of whatever he wants.   Pretty sure he'll be fine with that.

My suspicion is that you're the one parroting someone else's talking points, not the author.  As an example: while researching Trump's projected budget cuts to the state department I found a Breitbart piece predicting a 37% reduction in their budget. In the article, the author of this particular opinion piece took the side of cutting foreign aid while increasing defense spending. Now all the conservative faithful are simply parroting Breitbart.  Basically, Trump's budget merely reflects his monumental ignorance.

Well, that has turned out to untrue as to numerous members of his campaign and his own family.  Add in false information supplied in the SF86 documents submitted by Flynn and Kushner, most notably, and very real questions exist SIMPLY BECAUSE THE WORD OF TRUMP AND HIS PEOPLE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AS EITHER ACCURATE OR THE TRUTH.  Also looks very, very much like Trump tried to use his position to stop or quell law enforcement investigation into issues related to Russian contacts during the campaign.  There has been ample evidence reported about Russian attempts to interfere with and influence the election.  Why suppress?

It is a little unfair that nowadays there is free speech, but, appears to be limited to the liberal views and the conservative views are frowned upon. Example, why is it almost every time a conservative wants to discuss a stance at Berkley, the left side puts up such a position of threat that the speeches are cancelled. As wrong as these people might be to defend their positions, are we not excluding them from their rights to discuss their views? It always takes two to tango.

I also believe we exist on a moral bell curve with a lot of area for shades of gray. I do believe that Trump's success can be credited to his racist, bigoted, misogynistic campaign as much as the voters wanting deep reform in connection with this gilded age and non-stop wars.  All racism isn't """"hard,"""" meaning out in the open, Jim Crow style. Much of it is soft, as you state, systemic and institutionalized.  Much of it is values based.

0,"I would not call it bluster.  In dealing with NK, they are warnings of what will take place if NK makes the ultimate mistake of arming its' missiles and landing them on U.S. territory, and those of its' close allies.  The bluster is from NK.  In the past, NK would kidnap, kill SK politicians, torpedo their ships, and support international terror.  They would deliver an ultimatum that this would continue which would decelerate when it was financially compensated.  NK would escalate tension approximately every five years that would end the crisis with the grift pay out.  This happened under both Republican and Democratic administrations having to deal with nepotist-stalinist rogue regime of the grandfather, father, and now the grandson.  Trump has brought this blackmail to a crashing halt.  He has stated the obvious.  There will be no more NK should they arm and use their missiles with nuclear warheads and strike, or give every indicator that they are about to do this.

Will CO2 levels reach an equilibrium or will they continue to rise?  I am so sick and tired of reading articles written by radical Climate Change alarmists that make up facts and site antidotal evidence.  It will be nice to have a debate based on actual science without being bullied by those that claim the science is settled.  Science is not decided by poles, journalists or politicians.  Why is it that the alarmists do everything they can to shut down debate and discredit anyone that does not hold to Climate Change orthodoxy?

Most of all, he was disastrously blunt in his bellicose rhetoric toward the DPRK.  His threat to """"annihilate"""" the DPRK is going to alienate even allies such as the RoK and Japan which are threatened by Kim.  They will point out:  1) Any full-scale attack on Kim will have terrible consequences for Japan and the RoK.  2) 25 mil North Koreans should not be slaughtered to stop Kim.  3) His rhetoric is counter-productive in that it will make the criminally-insane fascist, Kim, more aggressive and more likely to attack first because he believes that he has nothing to lose by doing so.

0,"Seems to me that it is very questionable whether Trump can actually reduce taxes the way he has promised.  It appears that the only way he can do this in the short term, is to allow huge deficits and increase in the national debt; both of these are completely opposite to everything the GOP stands for.  Trump's obvious trouble getting his much promised and advertised health care legislation past Congress or the Senate is a clear indication he will never achieve much in the way of tax reduction.
"
0,"Despite endless intimidation of elected senators Trump could not ensure the passage of a health """"care"""" bill that he, doubtless, had not read. Trump's objective here, as in other legislative initiatives, is to wipe away any laws that were passed during the Obama years. It matters not whether existing laws benefit tens of millions of Americans. If these laws were passed while Obama was in power they have to go. I'm not sure whether Trump is doing this because Obama was a mixed race president. In any case, two resolute ladies and a great patriot, John McCain, have done their bit to ensure that the US remains a functioning democracy.

Congress will forge a more independent agenda and Trump will have significant difficulty getting his own way. While listening to a CNN commentator explain why the U.S. is a weaker nation internationally under Trump, I wondered if this is really such a bad thing? Trump's version of projecting American strength apparently entails an assertive and belligerent foreign policy, where he shouts orders and expects everybody to obey.

In most states, a electoral college voter CANNOT vote """"against the state majority"""" (even if the """"majority"""" is only 51% - which means essentially 49% of the state's votes """"didn't count"""") without repercussions (in some states civil, in others criminal).

1,"Good point. White Supremacists, Nazis, and the White Nationalist and Supremacist branch of the Alt Right (not all of the Alt Right is racist) support Trump, but not every Trump supporter supports the racist views of these groups. A similar point applies to Black LIves Matter-- there may be members or supporters of that group who have racist views of whites, but not every supporter of Black Lives Matter is racist (for that matter, you see a lot of whites in the Black Lives Matter parade). Also, judging from the comments from politicians, not only liberals are opposed to racism-- conservatives are as well.  The Nazi's, KKK, and numerous white supremacist groups at the parade-- including some who attend these parades just to beat up protestors (like the """"White Fight Club"""") are groups that very few people in the country support but events like this get them a lot of media exposure.

He's been blamed for """"leading from behind"""" but other times he is accused of using excessive Exec. power. Which is it? The old boom was from drilling on private lands. The Right rubs that in his face. I've heard the charge of criticizing Trump before he has """"assumed power"""". How about Trump stop tweeting policy like he's President?

Here is how it gets distributed: 10 of the wealthiest people in the room get a total of  $1,000,000 of the $2,000.000 or $100,000 each. That leaves $1,000,000 to split among 990 People: The next top earning 100 people get $500,000 total of the cut, or $5,000 each. The remaining 890 people get the last $500,000 or $562 each.

Post brexit EU is GERMANY + france the rest are hengers on. But EU also needs to trade with Eastern Europe and Russia.  Russia needs to trade with EU to prosper. USA does not like it. The last thing USA wants is Russia prospering and the second last thing is EU becoming friendly to Russia. Canada is a friend and a second cousin to USA and first cousin to UK. Canada is floating inside an Anglo-American cultural soup. Quebec is the only differentiation we have visa vis the cousins.

Look at how we was before being a candidate, leading up to, and then who he surrounded himself with when he wanted to get elected. Trump the man wouldn't be with someone like Mike Pence, but Turmp the candidate sure was.  It's not unlike all the absurdities around George W. Bush being a """"good old born again Christian boy from West Texas"""". Christians seemed quick to forget he wasn't some rancher but the son of a former president and head of the C.I.A.

I've been wondering what would cause the US to seriously consider stopping funding of the entire UN structure.  They are now paying for 22% of the UN budget, and they need to conserve cash to afford their infrastructure spendings and moderinising their defence.  I suspect if Trump asked for a referendum with americans whether they should reduce their payments to the UN by and only pay for <5% of the total budget instead of 22, he will get a resounding yes.   5% is roughly comparable to the proportion of US population as a fraction of the total world population.   China could be paying for 22%.

Where Business exists upon fiscal reality and accountability, Politics exists upon emotion and charity.

A business hack goes only so far in politics until tarred and feathered in the town square.

As an independent who had never ran for office as a Democrat he had to know he was facing an uphill struggle. He could have put his own organization together, gotten himself on the ballot in all states, and ran as an Independent. His legislative record suggests he doesn't have the organizational skills to pull that off, and hey, the Democratic Party had a megaphone they were willing to let him use, so why not run as a Democrat. Polls did show that Sanders could have beaten Trump (of course these were polls taken before any GOP attack ads targeted him).

Comey released derogatory information on her handling of classified information and made what the FBI called a closing argument against Hillary without a trial. The memo soundly criticizes Comey's letter to Congress just before the election as a serious break of FBI policy. The Assistant AG citing FBI Policy and the FBI rules going back to several past Attorney Generals, including a comment from Eric Holder-- Obama's AG--on Comey's violation policy by delivering the letter just before the election.

On the other hand, you do NOT believe the Russians attempted to influence the US Election,  because the evidence shown to the President was never made public.  Interesting.  Also, I can't begin to tell you how HILARIOUS it is for you to use Snowden's leaks as justification for your arguments, while at the same time ranting about the evilness of leaks in general.

The reality is, the C & C of Honolulu had to beg for State of Hawaii & Federal monies.  Live long enough in Hawaii, and, you can see a constant recycling of bad government fiscal management.  The original lowest bidder, will always have cost overruns, because of inflation or some other financial disasters.  When everything is eventually built, it falls apart, faster than it was built.  When you sandpaper POTUS Trump's rear end, and, demand Federal monies from him, expect political retaliation.  Using diplomacy and choosing your political words carefully, means nothing anymore.

Comey is going to tell us that Trump tried to obstruct justice by pressuring him to kill one or more FBI investigations into untoward and illegal contacts between the Trump entourage and Russian figures. Trump, of course, was attempting to obstruct justice by firing the FBI director, Comey, specifically because Comey would not show his """"loyalty"""" by killing FBI investigations that would produce damaging information on several current members of the Trump administration. We know all of this already. What we don't know is why Trump is not being held to account for an endless stream of unethical and very likely illegal actions.

So, the GOP allowed the most in-troubled ones to vote against it, while insisting on probably a few of them to take their chances at the poll (likely gave them promises of PAC money, and perhaps Trump/Pence backing). Bad budget, and REAL bad idea of doing tax cuts. Far better for the dems to push a SANE taxation reform, rather than allow this junk to go through. Delete
"
0,"rammad012,  I take your point about the relative sizes of the 2 economies and the relative importance of NAFTA to each of these 2 economies.  However, this contest is not a zero sum game because both sides will suffer if relations become ugly.  Preferred access to the combined markets of Canada and Mexico is important to several important States and several key industries in the US and these domestic US interests will be our allies when push comes to shove provided Canada with Mexico make a good case in a resolute but reasonable manner.  Likewise, many important US corporations have important Canadian and/or Mexican interests they will want protected.  Further, overt bullying of Canada and Mexico over NAFTA will poison the well for US trade negotiations with many other nations with which the US wants to renegotiate trade agreements.  Realizing this will limit Trump's scope of action over NAFTA.

1,"continued. And it’s all out there. None of this was ever hidden. Trump and his family don’t even really try to deny the above; they revel in it. They are narcissists supreme. There is *nothing* admirable about this person. Nothing at all. And he has passed it on to his children. I’m always reminded of a tweet that DT Jr. sent years ago where he was praising how the hired help worked for his family over Christmas or something, and he posted like “love loyalty to us!” They are just the most openly despicable people. And so *obviously* so. They don’t even hide it. Their evil and hypocrisy is *open*. They praise themselves for it. I genuinely can’t think of a worse person in public life. Plus, you can add in the fact that he is a traitor. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ee59a0dae9d6c696605df5ae7e62ca3d553d3be7eefb88ef3fe6916b97db809b.jpg

0,"Hi Gary:  An intricate and involved issue on a myriad of scientific and social-policy grounds, and impossible to even list the important facets of the subject within the limits of the present comment board.  But just to touch on certain topical notes:  (a) No, I don't place much credence in any of Mr. Trump's more colorful remarks on China, climate,  walls, or most anything else.  (b)  Don't I expect to perish tragically in a monumental climate catastrophe?  Short answer:  """"No"""" ... because as a trained earth scientist I understand the geologic context of modern trends better than most, vis a vis sea levels, CO2, T, etc.  (c)  The most vocal members of the scientific community on climate change invariably are government workers or tenured academics, where quite literally it doesn't matter whether they are Right, Wrong, or Indifferent on anything they say - their jobs are safe.  :-/  (d) """"... stampeding ...""""

0,"I concur that Trump isn't an aberration within the GOP; quite the contrary, he's a manifestation, if not culmination, of what Republicans have espoused the past 35 years. Nevertheless, how is Hillary a significant departure from this? It must cause the GOP establishment unremitting heartburn that it's ideal candidate is running for the Democrats this year.  Not only is this US presidential election a choice between bad and worse, but signifies a conspiracy against hope. One can only hope that America is hitting rock bottom with this, given that a victory of either candidate WONT represent an unqualified endorsement. Indeed, it seems the sole rationale for voting for Hillary is to prevent a Trump victory, while the opposite also applies. I'm afraid that next week is merely a prelude to a festival of animus and chaos down south.

If Trump was impeached and did leave office then we're left with Mike Pence.  Pence is more conservative than Trump and has years of experience in public office.  Pence could get things done.  I like Trump for now because he's woefully incompetent. He can't get out of his own way.  He keeps tripping over his own too long neck tie.  He's not just a side show, he's the whole circus: clowns, elephants and balloons.  Pence wouldn't be like that.  Republicans would love to see a Pence presidency.  Anyway the articles for impeachment would have to start in the House.  The same House that just passed his healthcare ban.  That ain't going nowhere.

But that doesn't get much discussion.  Why?  More money in war.  Have to feed the military industrial complex?  What a waste.  No wonder we are falling behind other industrialized countries that do not waste their resources on war and prisons.  This has nothing to do about love of America but the love of big bucks from guarding against an imaginary fear.

0,"The real issue here Thor, is that you obviously have a poor understanding of Nazi history ( and very likely history as a whole ). The Nazi did not just seize control. They came in over a decade and took over a party that had a different theme. The ORIGINAL Nazi party was nothing like what Hitler and his henchmen created. More importantly, they based on things like reforms, or 'I will rebuild the military, cut taxes and balance the budget'. Then they usurped groups that were in power and rather quickly took control of things like schools. Heck, Hitler's youth was started quickly and Nazis installed teachers into schools who reported back to the party. Iow, they bypassed the standard route. There is a real reason why kkk/Nazi support the current GOP, and just trump.

Very few folks worldwide did not accept VII reforms - period; historical truth.  Now revisionisms and ROTR crowd is trying to recapture their pre-VII ideology. Suggest that, in some ways, the ROTR crowd is similar to the roughly 1900 time period and the Lost Cause movement that preserved white privilege - using Confederate statues, passing restrictive laws (think this new translation); re-inventing history (think Benny).  ROTR revisionism is to correct VII (using code words - latin mass, extraordinary form can help correct ordinary form, regulations to enforce use of Gregorian Chant, etc.) Eucharistic Prayer is our principal statement of faith, our principal creed; it first and foremost a prayer for unity.  Mass is a sacrifice because it is a meal. The four parts of the Mass give us a structure for all the sacraments.

So we also need a good socialist party by leaders such as Bernie Sanders.  I am not a socialist, fact is I am far more conservative, but he was the ONLY viable candidate that was running last time.  Conservatives be shamed.  Cruz a conservative?   No he panders to environmental ruination, fear and lack of human dignity.  Much more could be said about the other """"so called"""" conservatives running last time.  Now we have a man that is emotionally unstable running the country.  True Conservatives need to quit pandering to the .2 % of the wealthy.  They are no more conservative than Donald Trump or Mao Te Tung.

The fact that in the meantime the Court has declined to side with the government on the need to even temporarily shut down entry of immigrants and refugees with U.S. connections, notwithstanding the government's national security arguments, marks a serious blow to the government, particularly given its sweeping arguments about the president’s discretion to do just that under his Article II powers and the Immigration and Nationality Act.""""

0,"Although the US should deal with illegal immigrants from Mexico, Central America and elsewhere, there is a huge amount of cheaper labour provided by many of these people.

I'd much rather see a measured approach, perhaps where US employers could sponsor workers (who don 't have criminal records) for eventual citizenship. Unfortunately, I don't think I have the ear of the Trumpster on this.

While our POTUS has decided in his infinite wisdom to declare diplomacy to fight the war on terrorism. President Trump will join President Hollande in asking Congress to declare war on terrorism. I applaud the courage of Donald Trump in his declaration.

0,"Sadly, confessing the sins of others provides no benefit, especially if the party you principally refer to has no shame.  On Trump, Liberty brought ruin on themselves.  On Aquila's remarks - abortion is not only not the most important issue, it is not an issue at all because there are no realistic proposals on the table (except the Clinton plan to raise the Child Tax Credit, which will reduce abortion).  The pro-life movement of the young is about public relations and moral teaching, not changes in law.  The label pro-life is meaningless without them.  That is just a version of being pro-choice until they adopt legislative goals. There is no valid legal goal - undoing federal supremacy in equal protection law cannot and should not happen, no matter how much the bishops want it.  They can capture state government - not so much with the Feds.

If he were truly naive enough to believe Trump actually had some degree of credibility, it shouldn't have taken long to figure out that his beliefs in the man were misguided. He could have quit then, but didn't. I personally have no compassion for anyone that continuously goes before the country and intentionally lies and defends the indefensible. Along with Spicer, Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders come to mind. At the very least, no matter where fate takes them, they will all be known publicly as blatant liars for the rest of their lives.

I believe there are many like myself who at this point are weary and just kind of ignoring him, and ready to give up, not necessarily ready to turn on him, but just ready for something else. In an interview a few days ago with Tucker Carlson, it seemed the ever faithful Mike Pence was even running out of excuses for his behavior, Trump cannot run the country effectively with all this chaos - Donald - If you are listening, how about offering some leadership, rather than intimidation, you may find that more effective.

Trump can be accused of being mentally deficient, of being dangerous and that's OK, that's their first amendment right.  But when he fights back with a professional wrestling video, that's a call to violence against reporters.  So, much for a level playing field.

That is something that most of us recognize as straight out bullying, and we don't react favorably to bullies.  We learned how to handle them in grade school.

Hillary Clinton also lied to the families of those who were killed in Benghazi, including a US Ambassador.

0,"When there are special tax treatment for a segment of the population there is a problem period.  The reality is unless you have high income you do not get to take advantage of those provisions.  How can billionaires end up paying no income tax?  By being able to use tax provisions their high income allow for.  While the tax laws are complicated it has been easy to place preferential items into the tax code that only a few would ever get to use.  A great example is now being proposed. Trump has proposed to eliminate the alternative minimum tax.  That would have allowed him to make $ 150,000 million in 2005 and pay no tax.  A simple change is tax laws would net Donald $ 30,000,000. Now for the majority of tax payers, not the top earner, what would this change do for them? Nothing!  While it will not happen, it is all the special things in the tax code that need to be changed not an entire elimination of everything to fool Americans into believing they have a better idea.

He's already politically blown up the country, and appears to LOVE IT.  Not to achieve an end, not to prusue a policy agenda.  Just to feed that thing that drives him.

Although Trump and his team now claim that Papadopoulos had no influence on the campaign, after Papadopoulos's April meeting with the Russian email contact, on July 27, 2016, Trump stated, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing,” he said. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That will be next.” (Curiously, he then didn’t hold another press conference for the rest of the campaign.)  No one outside of the campaign knew about Papadopoulos' meeting with Russians regarding emails prior to Trump's July statement. At the time, no one outside the campaign understood why Trump  was soliciting Russian help in making them public. Now we do.

Third, there are nearly 4m that fell into what’s known as the “Medicaid gap,” with incomes that were too high for Medicaid eligibility and too low to receive subsidies on the new health care exchange.  (Because their individual states did not utilize federal expanded Medicaid).  This will change under Trump, anyone who wants insurance will be able to purchase it.

That is 3 million barrels a day. Second out lumber price has doubled and all other good can only be shipped if Canada receives the US price for said items.

0,"It's the guns vs butter approach in growing an economy. The American Navy is currently at 272 ships. Under the current 30-year shipbuilding plan, it's expected to reach 308 ships but that would require $4.5 billion dollars additional spending in annual shipbuilding than has been budgeted for.  Donald Trump has pledged to increase the US Navy to 350 ships. That would mean another additional $4 billion dollars in annual shipbuilding costs. Building these ships will cost at least $10 billion dollars more every year and it has to come from somewhere.  Clearly Donald Trump believes that building more warships will increase blue collar jobs in navy shipyards. As to their purpose of more warships, it's to intimidate the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, etc. We're likely to see a carrier task force continually maintained in the South China Sea or the Black Sea.

Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Iran is not in breach of the agreement. Even Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Iran is in compliance with the agreement. No one says Iran is not in compliance, but Trump, not one of our allies, no one. No one but Trump. Trump says Iran is not in compliance because a treaty that works was put forth under a black president. That's the only reason Trump will heedlessly take a flyer at destabilizing the Middle East.

Trump told one associate he missed his old life in New York. And he’s become increasingly focused on the prospect of losing support among his core supporters — the voters he once said would stick with him even if he shot someone on New York’s Fifth Avenue.  “I don’t think it’s a worry or a concern as much as it’s a reality,” Roger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to the president, said of Trump’s preoccupation with his base. “It’s a reality that he understands politically.”  Polls show Trump losing a bit of ground with some of his core constituencies.

0,"Both Trump and Congress spoke about the need to control costs (Trump threatened cancelling contracts and audits of overruns). Defense suppliers especially Lockheed are making a killing in recent deals. Lockheed is making $Billions selling the new FF 35 to 11 countries and manufacturers are selling state of the art anti-missile systems and rockets to countries like Saudi Arabia. Contractors will also benefit from big cuts in the corporate income tax. Hold their stick if you have it.

"
0,"Government is not a business. Or like a business. It is much more like a family. Businesses are always optimizing profits and efficiency. Government can't do this in any meaningful way as it must defend the young, the old, the poor, and the challenged. Whereas business seeks customers 18 to 54, usually male, and considers the rest a niche market or a drag.  I often hear the Right complain of public sector union wages, mostly because they seek to drive the wages of their workers down and have crushed many unions by shipping jobs to Mexico or China. But private sector salaries for managers are astronomically higher than those in the public sector and these managers rarely own the company. The Right like to say government is wasting taxpayers' money, but never complain that wealthy CEOs are wasting shareholders' profits.  The Trump administration is rife with conflicts of interest. Every time Trump flies to Mar-a-lago or to NYC's Trump Tower, it's money in his pocket.

We saw with Obama that despite the unanimous opposition of Congressional Republicans to any Obama proposal, some very good things got done, like expanded and improved medical coverage, the rescue of more than a million rust belt jobs in the auto industry, and other progressive triumphs.

It's about values we treasure and won't surrender to the passions of the moment. Trump is digging a moat around himself with a paranoid shovel. But the issue is and will continue to be whether we can find a way to live together in this world fraught with danger. We need to speak about how to do that, and perhaps spend less time  focusing on what Tony Soprano once aptly described as """"the 500 pound elephant in the room."""" (Kudos to Dickens and Mrs. Malaprop.) Sooner or later, Trump will go away. If all we've done is focused on him as the problem, we may well suffer the same fate.

What's needed is a law that prohibits frivolous investigations of a President with severe penalties for the violation thereof.  Mueller can say Trump is squeaky clean, and the next witch hunt will commence.  Trump has proven to have good instincts in an arena in which he is unfamiliar.  Whereas the traditional approach to an investigation is to ignore it (like Hillary), Trump is embracing it, Tweeting away.  Methinks there is method to his madness in this as there has been in his madness all along.  Contrary to the liberal elites' impression, Trump is not stupid.  Not by a long shot.

0,"I think we all commend Mr Trump for listening and focusing on a critical issue that has been ignored by many others. However, to suggest that trade agreements are the cause is misleading. Automation has eliminated far more jobs.  New infrastructure spending will certainly help in the short term but what happens when we have enough roads and bridges and our debt is even higher. We need longer term solutions that will help future generations of Canadians.  People are looking for simple solutions to complex problems.  I agree, Mr Trudeau, Ms Wynne don't have the answers. But neither does Mr Trump from what I have heard so far.

If """"fewer abortions"""" really is the main goal--and a USCCB-allowed single-issue voting premise--why isn't reducing abortion by every means possible a moral mandate?  Yes, many religions join with Catholics in arguing for religious liberty, but even the most pro-life, conservative, Trump-supporting evangelical pastors consider contraception an allowable--even an oft-commendable--aspect of family planning and marital relations..  Many are confused at the seeming equivalency Catholic leaders assign to the issues and, to be honest, feel it can get in the way of anti-abortion legislation advocacy.

This resorting to bullying and violence worked wonderfully in Germany in the 1930's. Are Trumpet's opponents going to have to wear yellow stars of David once again? Every time a single citizen is assaulted physically with the approval of political leaders and with discrimination, we come closer to another holocaust.

The whole purpose of mass media is to remain cutting-edge Relevant.  Yet, there is no other way to present the reality that on his way to kick over the table and upset all the gatekeepers of US culture, Trump vanquished the mass media that was pretty much heavily rooting for his humiliation.   It was not enough for Trump lose.  It would have to be a landslide of biblical proportions to make those rednecks understand the arc of history bends towards something Worthy.

As I've been telling my Republican friends, if they'd give the Hispanics Immigration Reform that gives the undocumented a legal way to stay, that would likely get them a majority of the Hispanic vote by enough to prevent the Democrats from ever winning again.  The Democrats had their chance during Obama's first two years and did nothing for the Hispanics.  At least the GOP got the """"Gang of 8 Plan"""" passed in the Senate.

The ME is tribal. Has been for thousands of years. Strongman rule is in their culture.  Well, America made its bed through their inference in the region. It now has to lie in it. Doesn't matter what Trump will do, it will be a festering pus boil that will be permanent. They have made an enemy for life.

No one who gave a thought to the Big Beautiful Door that Trump wanted to put in his Big Beautiful Wall (etc. - there were other clues) imagined that Trump was as anti-invasion as he was represented to be by the likes of the WSJ and himself, but that misrepresentation and Trump's own made his candidacy an opportunity to demonstrate anti-invasion strength. The lesson is being determinedly denied by the WSJ, the GOPe, and the usual suspects, but it's still there for anyone to see. Breitbart is right on this.

It's always been the case that Canada has limited options given our economic ties to the behemoth south of our border. Unless Canadians are willing to put their jobs on the line, caution should guide the government going forward. So far I'd say they are doing a good job of finding balance.  As for Canada not being the """"Donald Trump Opposition Party,"""" fine, but that should not mean that we throw out our interests, abrogate treaties, not stand with our allies, jettison the Geneva Convention, etc. I'm really unclear on what Ms. Wente means when by the statement.

Ms. Cooper is a fine example of what is dividing this country.

No, these conversations weren't exactly like Trump's.  Except for one story involving a prostitute, they didn't describe assaults.  And nobody claimed to be a star who could grab women at will.

0,"I agree with Ms. Renzetti's characterization of Shel Silverstein's """"The Giving Tree"""", perhaps the most odious children's book I have ever encountered; after going throuh it myself first, I refused to read it or anything else by that author to my daughter when she was little. Over the years, the tree lovingly provides all manner of benefits to the boy - eventually even giving up its life to the man the boy has become - while he shows absolutely no gratitude or even the barest recognition of all the gifts he has received. Like Trump, he takes everything that comes to him for granted, with no concern for anything but his own self-interest. And, with no sense of irony or larger moral perspective, the author presents the boy's/man's total lack of awareness or insight as being absolutely fine. But I agree that it describes Trump to a T.

It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.”

0,"Cyndy Cox - I agree with you on Trump, but if they vote for or endorse Hillary, they are saying """"YES, YES, YES"""" to the previous violent overthrow of several democratically elected governments, the bolstering of the surveillance state, dealing arms out of a US embassy, the theft of increased taxation, the (attempted) disarming of the American people in preparation for the curtailment of other civil liberties, stealing kids from families that have done nothing wrong except believe differently than Hillary Clinton or say no to the public school's indoctrination of their children and putting marked classified documents out on an unsecured server for anyone with a little skill to read.  The choice is not either-or. There is a third choice. If our delegation wants to make a difference, they can endorse Gary Johnson, but if they endorse Hillary they are voting for a wannabe dictator who will use the executive power to tyrannize us.

Sadly, Ms Wente grossly underestimates the power of the vast hordes of broader public sector employees and their Unions to mobilize the vote for whoever is promising the status quo for them. So long as they are kept in the lap of luxury, with all the attendant 5-star perks that others can only dream of, no party preaching fiscal restraint can ever win. Exactly what Justin did, promising to spend more. For all of Trumps darker sides, his pro economy pro business model is slowly starting to appeal to voters of all stripes, except perhaps the extreme socialists. It would be nice of other mature economies can emulate Trumponomics minus the unpleasant elements like anti trade, anti [legal] immigrant policies.

It's quite a show when a bit of logic induces a literal brain fart that typically leads to a mumbling meltdown on par with my three year-old at bedtime.  They're like grown-up children, but without the grown-up part.

0,"You're not paying attention. At this stage of history, the United States is entirely driven by media hype and where they're driven effects us enormously. Opinions of Trudeau here are, frankly, somewhat irrelevant given the global climate, it's in the US that counts and Americans actually do love him, even their President does. The PM has to make time to be a celebrity, that's who Trump wants to be connected to. Despite what you think, Harper wouldn't register, he's a world non-entity and if you can't see that, then you aren't paying attention to how Trump is taking pains to connect himself with Trudeau and Macron, positively. He craves the media hype like nobody else and these two are very in the media.  So, yeah, the world isn't just in a spreadsheet, you also need to sell. Trudeau is selling far, far, better than Harper ever did and that matters whether you like it or not. I didn't vote for him, but I'm much happier to see Trudeau in the role than Harper under the circumstances.

And Gaudium et Spes called it an """"unspeakable crime"""" (you don't dissent from Vatican II, do you?).  But yes, a number of Catholics voted for Trump over Hillary because, as caustic as he was, we saw him as preferable to Hillary.  Was abortion an issue?  Yes.

I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party.”  Fact-Check continued:  """"The New York Times also reported at the time that Trump issued a news release referring to Duke as “a Klansman” and not the “company I wish to keep.”  According to Fact-check, """"Trump also spoke out against Duke in 1991 – three days after Duke lost a race for governor in Louisiana.""""

I understand he is bringing his former ambassador to the US during the NAFTA talks, Derek Burney, to this cabinet committee meeting.  Burney is one smart cookie and will also add value to this important meeting.

0,"For the same reason that the majority of Bernie Sanders supporters are white.  Those Sanders whites would just like to see a northern European liberal socialist style government, rather than a more conservative free market system trumpeted by Trump.  Many Sanders socialists and Trump types want to live in what could be call a WASP based culture. (White Anglo Saxon Protestant).  This is the culture that middle class America was built on.  Other groups around the world have adopted it or are similar to it in many aspects.  Japanese for example, live intermixed very well with WASP culture even though the Japanese tend to be xenophobic.  It is not race, it's how people want to live and what they value.  Many people don't support Trump because (besides the bias in the media) there is a cultural divide in American society.  It is very real, but it is not a race based divide nearly as much as it is a """"way of living"""" divide.  And of course the establishment pits one race against another.

If you want it to be changed without using the mechanisms the Constitution itself lays out, then vote for Clinton as those she will nominate to the Supreme Court will reinterpret it as they see fit until it is unrecognizable. Trump will nominate those who will uphold the meaning of the Constitution as it was written.  Clinton is undeniably untrustworthy, having been shown to have purposefully lied over and over again about her email server and the security threat it posed and still poses to our nation. If damaging personal emails were among those she deleted, including ones that may indicate she abused her authority to enrich her family through the Clinton Foundation while Secretary of State, she could be blackmailed by foreign leaders while in the Presidency. If there is any chance of that, and there is, we can't allow it.  Trump is far from prepared, but is a good decision maker. He'll learn quickly and do fine.

It's possible he has a good heart; every day, people with 'good hearts' do harm to others from sheer selfishness.  KelleyAnn thought she was 'good-hearted' in supporting her friends by endorsing Ivanka's brand, and her first reaction is not to apologize but defend herself.  Trump is so clueless he doesn't even know what he's doing and saying wrong, since he never considers any viewpoint except his own.  As the center of the universe, rules don't apply to him.  We may not know what is in Trump's heart, but we CAN judge him by his actions.

As the Washington Post reported, Bannon has other ideas:  Bannon, in phone calls and meetings, has been urging Trump for months to not mount a fall campaign that makes Republican donors and officials comfortable, the aides said. Instead, Bannon has been telling Trump to run more fully as an outsider and an unabashed nationalist.

If, on the other hand, you are suggesting that that the US military counter Trump's impetuous judgements with more stable, solid advice and recommendations, then yes of course.  It presently looks like Trump has little respect for intelligence assessments, but it is quite possible he will respond differently to military advice. I say that because he seems to have a lot of respect for generals (given his appointments), despite opposite impressions during campaign.

I mean, Trump has a history of shady dealings, including fraud and pathologically lying and a documented habit of demanding loyalty, interfering in investigations and in this case, came right out and said he got rid of Comey because of the """"Russia investigation"""" to get rid of the """"pressure"""" of the investigation,which I presume was getting too close for comfort.  Sounds to me like he fired Comey because he thought that would stop or seriously impede the investigation. Then there's the threats to Comey, and all the blatant attempts to derail the investigation, including by meeting with Nunes, etc. taken altogether, there's no other rational explanation.

The national news sources carried by the ADN are known to be reputable and the articles do seem to try to cover both sides.

Given the plurality of statements by Trump on warming issues, I conclude that he is weighing the matter and trying to decide the best course of action.  Token actions provide no real benefit to anyone except in terms of feeling good.  Yet the token actions have cost.  It is a challenge to determine whether the """"Paris accords"""" are worth their costs.  I suspect that the Paris accords are bad 1) because they come nowhere near eliminating atmospheric carbon growth and 2) because they lull people into believing that something effective is being done.  We have serious sacrifices to make globally if we are to control  atmospheric carbon.

0,"< you have no evidence of collusion.> I never said I had evidence of collusion. That evidence may or may not come out of the investigations. We know this: everything Trump and his underlings have said about Russia has been subject to revision; they're lying through their teeth. While it's true that Trump is a pathological liar, I think he has very good reasons for lying about Russia and for requiring everyone around him to lies about it. Clearly Putin owns him; Trump defers to Putin, appeases him, shows every sign that he's scared to death of him; I'm sure that's not without reason. I did find an article in a right wing source that asserts that Chomsky is not much concerned about """"collusion""""; I couldn't find an original or a collaborating source.

Especially because Orange is saying that Sessions should have made an unethical decision by not recusing himself.

The Bushes and Clintons have not drawn a breath, ate a meal or slept in a bed that was not paid for or associated with government money which is our tax money. Lifetime politicians should be outlawed from government offices, this is not the way the country was founded. It's time to break up the Bush and Clinton kingdoms. I believe that a person should have a business or political or in some cases military or foreign service background but they should come to office owing no one and rule with the people of the country in mind and not be covering for a group that will pay your election bills and looking for favors.

The values that date back to the Enlightenment are on the wane while cultural relativism, open borders, the accommodation and encouragement of tribal and religious factions, the division of communities based on conflicting values and hatred are all now magically transformed in the imaginary Canada of liberalism into “strengths”. This will ultimately cause strife, anger, division and warfare in Canada. Where there is no cultural and national unity there is chaos.

0,"The grand dilemma, especially for those in favor of the Trump """"change list"""", i.e., trade, secure borders, military rebuilding, etc., is his personality, the driving force of his actions that are such, that he must spend today undoing or re-explaining, with out ownership of the obvious, what he did or said yesterday. He does present as having Narcissistic Personality Disorder not just features of narcissism that many of us might share. Boundary management another arena in which he struggles. He cannot stay within the bounds of reason and retreats backward into outdated and unnecessary conflict. He is an easy set up and takes the bait over and over,  a man who can't get out of his own way. So for those who believe the Nation must change direction..and must vote for Trump and risk putting him on the World stage...then the focus must be on Congressional and Legislative processes to manage him. It will take a Constitutional village to keep him in check. Can that work? Maybe it can!

(Thus, you can have """"free trade"""" and """"Buy America"""" at the same time.) Some American politicians, like Obama, spoke kindly about multilateralism but even Obama eventually confirmed his allegiance to American exceptionalism. So, the new globalist order, which Saunders touts, was always an illusion of sorts, especially for Canada, whose economic cart is so firmly tied to the American horse. Trump has exposed this facade for what it is - mainly bluster. The Americans never really took it seriously. For better or worse, we're either with the Americans on their terms or we're not, but if we're not we face a brave new world, and perhaps one many in this country simply don't want to contemplate.

But nobody and nothing can mitigate the damage he might do to his own country if he has his way. And that's probably why he will lose on this file as well. For a guy that was so sure he'd win so much he'd get sick and tired of winning, he's yet to score a major victory. And we're all the better for it!

0,"There is more at play than just tweaking political parties.  Bill Clinton took the Dems too far to the right.  He was in fact a right centrist.  That eventually forced the GOP to go to the Tea Party end of things.  In the meantimes, the Dems had the stupidity to run another right wing Clinton because Obama couldn't swing things to the left.  By the time the Sander's voters convinced the Dems they needed a new direction, it was too late.  The Russian interference helped to see the HRC could never be elected with their Wikileaks dumps.  It's interesting to see what is happening with Ryancare.  Trump supporters are beginning to see some light about who they supported.  It may be that Trump killed his presidency by supporting Ryancare instead of trying to honor his promise of cheaper health care for everyone. Maybe Trump and his posse will figure out a single health care system would actually work to make America Great Again.  Unfortunately, there is his budget which is horrific.

So we are very happy that CLINTON LOST (reminder to many of you!) and that Trump is the prez.  I see him as the lesser of two evils.  With Clinton is would have been Obama's third term.

He's taking out the trash in the White House, as evidenced by firing both Scarimucci and Bannon.

It will do the opposite. Tracking is very complicated and very expensive. We now have thousands of pages of ever changing rules  no one understands. Over regulation has driven family farms and mom and pop businesses out replacing them with businesses owned by wealthy investors. But these bigger businesses are not more compliant, they are just more sophisticated at breaking rules. The result is higher prices at legal stores so lots of people return to the underground market, which is now bigger than ever. The answer is to have a simple system where everyone can participate. This will result in the least black market and the most tax revenue. The only way to stop diversion to other states is to end federal prohibition. Trump could fix this by letting states impose lean effective regulation,  but he won't.

So, the government, not the son-in-law of the President, sets up a back channel for communication.  We have formal diplomatic relations with Russia — my gosh, our astronauts are riding their rockets to the International Space Station.  Has the relationship gotten frosty?  Sure, an annexation of a part of another sovereign nation and subsequent meddling in Ukraine would cause that.  But then, then, we have clear and present danger of meddling in our election be it by manipulation of public opinion, hacking, or otherwise, doesn't matter.  Psychological warfare is still warfare.  So, why on earth would Team Trump be needing to set up a back channel to the Russian prior to the inauguration?  And to give this a pass is just strange.

If you can't make a case, don't post.  Streep held Trump's feet to the fire about a sickening thing he did.  If you can't respond to Streep by holding your head high here and honourably defending what Trump did, well, then you gotta' admit he erred and that Streep's comments were fair game.

0,"I foresee a great move to isolate America from the rest of the world---as President-elect Trump promises to 'make America great again.'  The isolationist policies will seek to:  1) cut trade with China and other trading partners both in the east and mid-east.  Americans will go to Walmart and be shocked at the price-hike on clothing and other items as a result. 2) there will be a 'freeze' on any action to protect the earth from further eco-damage.  Trump considers any ban on drilling for oil/gas, mining for coal because of potential harm to the planet as a HOAX. 3) pull out of NATO and allow nations in danger from Russia/China to 'fend for themselves'  Trump doesn't want to be president.  He wants to be an American dictator and will ruthlessly hound any Republican/Democratic who opposes him.  Progressives---Catholic or otherwise---need to gather and fly beneath the radar and just leave subtle, quiet messages with friends and neighbors as to the dangers America is in.

It's odd that the reasoning for Comey's dismissal came only days after he requested more funds to investigate Russian ties to the Trump campaign.  It's laughable to accuse Senator Schumer of hypocrisy. Schumer actually admired Comey publicly. He did not call for him to resign after the Clinton email incident. He said he'd lost confidence in him. It's a strong rebuke, but falls short of a demand for his job. And Obama did not fire Comey. Neither did Trump.  And how does Trump appoint a new director? Will he stall until the Russian investigation is stalled? Will he pick a loyal Trumpite? It will not look good if he picks someone who can't be seen as impartial.

Egypt (its domestic stability being key to US regional policy) relies significantly on the remittances by Egyptian nationals who work in Qatar.  It is true that, while Qatar in several ways plays a modernizing & moderating role in the region, it also serves unofficially as a conduit for funds for ISI, but so does Saudi Arabia and its allies in making these demands.

Ryan would not do this and just said he was willing to ask the House to discuss the bill with the Senate-- leaving it open to pass the bill and send it to Trump. Another problem resulting from rushing things, mistrust, and secrecy in the Republicans' procedure. Plus lack of leadership by Ryan and McConnell who should have dealt with this (they could have sought a commitment from Trump not to sign the bill until it went to the conference committee).

For example, you say that Obama spent 'billions' on his 'lavish and frequent vacations.' That is false. The actual total for his vacations, according to Judicial Watch, will end up costing us about $95 million over eight years which is 9.5% of a billion.  Right now it costs the city of New York (just the city) about $500,000 a day just to protect Melania at Trump Tower. That's $183 million per year. Trump's trips to Mar-a-Lago are estimated to cost about $3 million each. But we don't know the actual totals because Trump refuses to provide that information.  So , if you want people to give Trump a chance, then the lies he tells (and the falsehoods peddled by his supporters) have to stop.

Many are outraged at the democrats and the traitor republicans as well.  This country will be more divided than ever if Clinton is elected. Bitterly divided .  The only difference is that many democrats have said they are leaving the country if Trump is elected and the other side plans to stay right here. We will see her as a criminal who got away with it by destroying evidence . No person ever running for president has been more dishonest and untrustworthy .

0,"You're right, the """"deep state"""" is not formal, it's entirely grassroots.  However, it's not """"subversive"""". Congress is made of politicians, and their job is to serve their constituents, which these government employees are. If that means standing up to the President, it's perfectly legal.  Remember, Trump's not particularly popular and it doesn't take much to get the fence-sitters to sway one way or the other ... but they were already on the fence to begin with.  The Judicial branch does not act on its own, period. It requires someone to file a legal claim. There is nothing unconstitutional or """"subversive"""" about a government employee filing that injunction. If it's frivolous the courts will toss it out. If it has merit, then the system is right to consider it and block dubious behaviour on the President's part.  Again, none of this is """"subversive"""", and the so called """"deep state"""" would be ignored if it was not tabling valid criticisms.

I really don't think that Science, Math and Engineering, should be the major emphasis in learning. More worker's in Alaska, wear Carharts to work than those in suits. There needs to be at least as much or more emphasis on Vocational and Technical fields of study. That's not to say that S,M,E, isn't important, because it truly is but those fields should not trump the VoTech professions.  I know that OJT, is a large part of Vo/Tech training toward certification but it not but one small part of it. There is a lot of requirement for formal classroom instruction in many fields, including Nursing, Dental technician, Journey level Electricians, (both home and Industrial), Welding, Pipe Fitters, etc! The real sad part about our educaion system currently, is that much of the VoTech training classes could be done in conjunction with High School.

However why has the issue of Confederate monuments just surfaced now? Were they not in place for 8 years under Obama? Were they not just as inflammatory back then? Why were they not removed during the Obama years if they are such an important and negative symbol of racism? Or is this just a politically motivated move? Surely, when Black Lives Matters created significant chaos in his country, and he vaguely wagged a finger in disapproval, there would have been good cause to tear down monuments. It seems the US politicos are now into the business of white-washing history. Should we have a good old-fashioned book burning too - you know to ensure we can rewrite history to match our new progressive ways?

He out-worked and out-fought the competition to beat the wealthiest campaign foe in history. The man doesn’t quit and instinctively knows how to win.  My point was that he fought for the American people in a different type of war and shouldn’t be disparaged as a “draft dodger”. Trump has defined America’s enemies and put them on notice.  He has released the military generals from the control of the political civilians and lawyers conducting the fight from their desks in DC.  That is why the MOAB bomb was dropped, destroying a complex tunnel system in one afternoon. ISIS flourished after Obama’s Iraqi retreat. I give him no credit for regaining what he lost.  Trump enforced Obama’s Red Line. NK was a gift from prior administrations. China cut off their banking support yesterday. They are listening to Trump.

Intemperate speech may rouse Trump's low-brainpower base, but it doesn't work positively in diplomacy, which Trump also holds in contempt.

No prosecutors were threatened and we know this for the same reason.  The one thing I did do, was read your link with no stake in the game except to learn the truth.  I think the claims of racism are politically motivated and do not necessarily stand up to scrutiny.  I do not put much stake in people's inferences regarding others.  If anybody wants to know what Trump thinks about anything, he should be asked directly.  Allowing a person to state their beliefs and respect the answer sans direct and convincing contrary evidence is just basic respect.

0,"Compared to N. Korea, China's a glorious beacon of freedom.  N. Korea sets the bar pretty low. Not sure where you see this hegemony from China.  China hasn't forcibly went in with its military and overturned governments, unlike us in the middle east.  China's moves in their backyard (China Sea) have been largely becoming an ally with a country or building those islands, which is the part contested.  China said that it wants to build relationships with the countries that border the sea because it wants to ensure shipping lanes for its ships. If China had its military operating along our coast Americans would be crying foul.  When we do it to them, we call it protecting freedom.  Pfft.  Have you been reading about China's recent talks with S. Korea?  China extended a friendly hand and wants S. Korea to assist in the goal to denuclearize the Korean peninsula?  China is more about negotiation.  They see the problems with using force.  That tough talk by Trump is backfiring.

0,"Americans elected the anti Obama. On the surface Trump ticked all the boxes: wealthy, apparently successful, trophy wife, says what he wants when he wants and has the ability to say things people want to hear. When there are people desperate for survival in the American Heartland, Trump looked much better than Clinton. Trump has his own airplane, big obnoxious towers with his name in HUGE letters, an attractive family and a trailer park marital life. He says things that you say when you've had too much too drink or you're sunning yourself on top of your RV at a Nascar race at Talledega. Red necks love Trump. He's the man, treats women like you wouldn't treat your wife but it's amusing somewhat to hear him downgrade someone else's wife. These aren't my people and I haven't many people like this. I hope he doesn't let these folks down. They can be quite nasty. They all have guns; and aren't afraid to shoot.

0,"""""When you run as a member of a certain party , you are agreeing with that parties goals."""" . I think you are confused on how it is SUPPOSED to work. The expectation of blind allegiance to a party is a major contributor to the Washington gridlock. If you really want a bobble-head elected, then vote for a bobble-head. With your line of thinking, we really shouldn't be sending representatives. Instead, we can just vote for a party of our choosing and only send representation if the party we chose has no real representation in Washington. . Believe it or not, with the way things are going her voicing an opposing position puts her in a very strong negotiating position. If Trump decides to be petty, she only needs to lock a couple votes to grind Trump's agenda to a halt. Trump needs cooperation for almost every republican in the Senate.

0,"Trump has little to show for his time in office. He has signed a number of executive orders, but has yet to pass any meaningful bills through the Republican Congress. His first travel ban on Muslims was overturned by the Supreme Court. He has yet to address campaign promises on tax reform or the building of the wall. And, his effort to reform/repeal Obamacare has been rejected in Congress by his fellow Republicans.  His only success is having filled the Supreme Court vacancy with Judge Neil Gorsuch, thus ensuring a Conservative court for at least the next 20 to 25 years. Amazingly, Trump has managed to keep his head above water. However, things may be about to change. September will see Trump asking Congress to raise the US debt ceiling. That will see stiff resistance from Dems and hard line Republicans. Also, the Fed has promised too begin balancing the books. Expect to see an end to the Bull market and historic low interest rates. Nothing like a good ol fashioned war to fix it all.

0,"You're right. There are significant differences as well as similarities with Hitler, notably the lack of a coherent ideology. And as you say, Trump's inconsistent. I suppose it's an effect of ignorance, impressionability and impulsiveness. Courtiers like Bannon and Conway will have considerable influence, which is alarming. Trump does have a long history of bigotry that could become programmatic (such as the """"Muslim registry""""). The most striking similarity with Hitler, which inspired that article, is Trump's identification of the nation's destiny with himself. And Hitler is said to have been susceptible to flattery.  I wonder about the base. They are pretty invested in him, and they, too, are ideologically free-form, tossing conservative principle to the winds to embrace a demagogue who appalled traditional conservatives. I expect Trump'll toss some sacrificial lambs their way to keep them in line, and they'll blame their ongoing dissatisfactions on Obama.

Here’s a look back at the major terrorist attacks that have taken place on U.S. soil since 9/11, including the nationalities of the perpetrator, or perpetrators.  Of this list, zero fatal attacks were carried out by immigrants from the seven Muslim-majority countries targeted by the ban.""""

Otherwise I'm forced to believe President Trump lies are at best careless, ignorant mistakes, or he's a fool, and I don't think he's a fool.

They have no capacity to manufacture these military assets, nor buy them, so I would like the Trump admin to expose just what country is supplying these assets of war: It will be a combination of Russia, China and Pakistan, possibly Iran also.

Obama was wise to not pick sides in a conflict that has no good guys.  Obama ended the cycle of perpetual US involvement in middle eastern quagmires that get our soldiers killed and merely destabilizes the region. 3) Trump didn't engage with Xi so much as get schooled by him.  Trump looked like a fool. 4) Abe and Trump appear to get along.  That is exceptional considering how Trump has alienated most of our historical allies. 5) Oh, please.

Hillary had zero enthusiasm at her small rallies  with the exception of when she had her entertainer friends do her work for her.  She did not connect with the people as Trump and Bernie did, do press or answer questions.  The only networks she appeared on were the ones who were in her pocket, so again, no hard questions.  She also ran on being a female vs issues as her experience in her 30 yrs. of service proved  zero accomplishments.

The past and current Afghan government is rife with corruption which we enable. After $1 trillion and 2400 deaths/20,000+ wounded - why continue a losing pattern? Pakistan - US has learned to live with a dysfunctional/nuclear nation - wonder if Trump has now poked the bear? India - talk about inciting and injecting even more instability into this equation.

And, they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing substitutes .   So, after at least seven years of contentious efforts the Kigali agreement was inked in late 2016. Perhaps the best solution at this juncture would be for Congress to go ahead and ratify  the  the Kilgali Agreement.  Otherwise U S Industry will unnecessarily  suffer in International trade.

Ukraine was able to get rid of Putin's stooge, but I fear that probably isn't possible in the US, as the Congressional Republicans are so hungry for power they would cooperate with pretty much anyone, even Trump who insulted them at every turn, to steal from the poor and give to their true bosses, the 1%. I have to agree with Brooks on his main point, Trump will be the posturer in chief, but whoever is behind the scenes will dictate events. If it is a Cheney, and I think it is an amalgam of Manafort, Netanyahu lovers, and billionaires who will make billions off the next war, then yeah, we are just screwed.

As a controversial war, there were those like McCain who chose to go fight in it; and there were those like Clinton whose conscience led them to oppose it.  I deeply respect both points of view. But then there were those  low lifes-- and I knew many of them in college-- who were """"patriots"""" who supported the war but wanted to let others go fight it. Trump went to a military academy where he performed well in his military duties as well as athletics, perfect preparation for a future officer in Viet Nam.

0,"Toensing has sue innumerable democrats, usually the suits are baseless. His suit is based on hearsay, something told to him by somene else who couldn't verify what he said. The catholic church  doesn't even want to be involved in this because even though they did not get the full price for the property because pledges were not honored, they still received two million dollars more than the property was worth. The school was in financial trouble before Sanders was involved. This is a witchhunt designed to discredit the Sanders. It is a well known fact that Jane is deeply involved in the Sanders organization. Now that Sanders has topped poll after poll, and the one candidate we know could defeat Trump, both parties will be going after him. Republicans because they want to keep control, democrats because they want to keep  the war profits and healthcare lobby money coming in. It's like they have formed the United against progressive party.

0,"Trump did react differently to the two tragedies, for two reasons.  With the terrorist attack in New York he plays to his base big time and his purposeful need to call others names and throw nonstop accusations to put down others.  That hate and blame is pure bigotry and it sells real well to a certain conservative voter.  With the Las Vegas terrorist attack, he faithfully and very Republican minded succumbed to the NRA narrative that huge firepower in the hands of anyone is extremely profitable to a few, and the fact that the death toll in America is horrific is just gosh darn inconvenient.  Nothing to say, plus the glorious shooter had his rights. That absolutely nothing can be done to stem our harvest of self-inflicted carnage.   Our founding fathers and tradition demand it.  Plus, some of them certain conservative voters may have to rush to Washington with those weapons at any time, to protect their idea of freedom.

0,"The author is confusing the merit based system with annual budget for admissions.  Our system would still be same if our admission rate was 100,000 or 1,000,000 immigrants per year, provided enough people chose to apply.  That our admission rate is 300,000 has nothing to do with the merit based system.  Trump can exactly copy our system and cap the admission rate at 1,000,000 people.

0,"""""Health insurance does not equal health care."""" Now that's a comment that is logically correct but either wrong in fact or misleading. Health insurance means your health can be cared for before you have to go to the emergency room, at which point you are in a crisis that could have been avoided if you had health insurance. Of course it's expensive, insurance has to pay a lot of people whose job is to ration your health care and still make big money for the CEO's and the stockholders. Insurance was going up double digits annually for a decade before ACA, and that's with death panels refusing coverage and cheap plans that protected you fine until you got sick.  A lot of people are dishonest about health care, mostly fooling themselves. I think that includes you. What do you want, 40 million Americans without medical insurance? That's what Trump is offering.

As for diplomatic events blowing up before he goes I'm quite sure that the US government has had over 200 years dealing with foreign governments attempting to take advantage of the two month transition period in the hope that a certain level of inertia exists to slow down reaction times.  As regards the notion of millionaires and billionaires running the country so what else is new?  Perhaps you've forgotten the Kennedys (billionaires in 2010 dollars) or Roosevelts (both branches).  Going back even further George Washington had a wealth of $515 million in 2010 dollars, Jefferson $212 million, Jackson $119 million and James Madison $101 million.  Even Bernie Sanders is a millionaire.

For those of you who cheer this type of authority, then living in the United States isn't for you. I highly recommend moving to Venezuela as its president is looking for people like you to rule over.  But here is the best part of this story - Sullivan's office leaked it to Erica Martinson in order to humiliate Murkowski. Look at the print edition - totally different headline that what is on adn.com.  Sullivan was going to appear the hero while Martinson painted Murkowski as the villain.  It backfired.  Martinson wasnt expecting the story to go viral - which it did. Murkowski now looks like the hero and Sullivan looks like Trump's weak puppet.  And Martinson is being applauded for her """"great journalism"""" which saddens her as she wont get that Breitbart job she really wants.

But did the judges not know exactly the religion of all the terrorists the Executive Order targeted? Religion had nothing to do with the ban because Muslims and only Muslims were terrorists. - During Election 2016 all the horrifying acts of terror were committed by Muslims. Which triggered Trump to ban Muslims but only ----- """"until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"""" ----  (http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/index.html) - Trump' campaign speech and his anti-terror executive order had the very same structure as his campaign speech - (1) Muslims and only Muslims were terrorist (2) his reason for the ban were one and the same - until the US can figure out what is going on. -

Russia has little to offer to this country, so why are we fawning over them.  Several days ago Trump gave Russia a gift they have desired - the defunding of Syrian rebels fighting Assad and ISIS.  And Congress has to actually pass a law to stop Trump from lifting sanctions placed on Russia due to their attack on Ukraine. I can't imagine what  information Russia is using to blackmail our President, but it must be a doozy, maybe leading to jail for Trump and his family.

Trump has already slammed Trudeau twice and he isn't even in office yet. Once on the F-18 saga and once on the funeral of Castro (I am assuming that Justin's reluctance to attend has much more to do with the Trump Administration than anything that was brought up in the Canadian press). Since Trump is showing himself to be much more concerned for the status quo than anyone imagined, I wouldn't doubt it if he put a lot of pressure on to rescind the move to legalization.  On top of that they have fudged their support for proportional representation, refused to cancel Bill C-51, signed the CETA agreement and will try to pursue their own version of the TPP without the US.  All of these things are cause for concern, but not enough for me to ever consider voting for a conservative, ever again in my lifetime.

0,"Great column.  It is almost beyond embarrassing that we still need to explain basic economics to some Canadians. If our government pursues a protectionist agenda, costs for the vast majority of consumer items will go up... fast.  Your salaries, on the other hand, will not.  Will there be more jobs?  Maybe, but most low skill positions in manufacturing have already been replaced via automation so don't count on an employment boom anytime soon.  In the end, under a protectionist policy, consumer prices will rise without access to low-cost labour, and wages will stagnate given the relatively small market for domestically produced goods.  Despite what Donald Trump and his followers may preach, some problems simply don't have easy answers.  Be very careful what you wish for.  You just might get it.

They declare martial law, take over justice and military and declare Trump Supreme Ruler. Sounds crazy I know, but scarily not crazy enough to discount entirely.  Here's how it plays out:  Force Justice Dept's hands into revealing evidence that Trump is in pocket of Russians.  Impeachment procedures commence.  But they've convinced Trump's followers that the swamp is setting their guy up so drastic action has to be taken. Stand together for your democratically elected President! Take to the streets!

Of the three other charities, one declined to disclose how much it had received, another said it needed to submit more paperwork before receiving any money. The third didn't respond to questions by the Journal. Fox Business Network first reported in late February that only a fraction of the pledged donations had made their way to the vets groups. At the time, FBN reported, several groups said they had not received any money. And seven of the 22 told Fox Business Network they had received a total of $650,000.

The details of the case are even more unseemly. Florida’s Attorney General was considering opening an investigation into Trump University, which is accused of defrauding students. Bondi herself contacted Trump and asked for a political contribution. After a political committee associated with her campaign received the illegal $25,000 contribution, she decided not to pursue it.

He is a multi-millionaire given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Obama as a children's pediatric surgeon.  I knew many of them on active duty in the military.  And they weren't 'oreos', either.

0,"2/2 I'm retired and living on Social Security and a small savings. Without Medicare, I would be bereft of medical care. During most (but not all) of my working life, I had good employer-based medical insurance; but I know what it is to have no insurance, or too little. Members of Congress have what amounts to Medicare. We should be working toward a system in which everyone has Medicare. That system is achievable, but it pits the 'rugged individualism' of conservative economics, which treats health care as a widget, available to those who can afford it, against the 'common good' approach of progressive economics, which treats health care as a human right and is committed to working toward the goal of making that a reality. My original point was and remains that those voters who voted for Trump on pro-life grounds bought a pig in a poke. Two years from now, there will be more abortions, not fewer, as well as an increase in deaths from a variety of causes related to the lack of insurance.

1,"Perhaps you should be even more accurate and refer to your claim as a theory.  The interesting thing is that the study (which I haven't read but for now I'll accept your description) doesn't sound like it supports your theory at all.  How does it demonstrate """"...the left's desire to silence any and all who disagree with them""""?  That ascribed motivation is very theoretical methinks, but handy if you are trying to come up with a way to deal with the reality that academics tend to have big, smart, critically-thinking problem-solving brains and as a result they often do not tolerate the emotional stupidity that is rampant in the Trump age.  If conservatives can't handle being bombarded by reason & logic, that's sad, but let's not blame it on some drive of academics to make stupid people feel stupid.  Stupid people should naturally feel stupid when called out, but we live in a new age where people believe every thought is equally valid.  It's been a disaster for dialog in America.

Trumps entire life has been spent in the company of elite wealth and not as an equal, but as a servant to the needs of his customer base.   He will always supplicate to real power and bully those of less power.  It's the world he knows.  Trump and others of similar wealth prefer a big wall to keep the riffraff/ugly out of their life.     (and there are lots of Liberal Democrats sitting in those same cozy million dollar condos).  A 2 am tweet is not walking the street of Cottage Grove, or facing a mortgage without the money to make the payment.  Partisanship  keeps us from looking at the sins in our own political house.

In both instances, people begin with a simple and emotionally-satisfying model of how the world should work, and then reject any science or evidence that challenges this belief.  The difference is that many of the educated who scoff at the fantasies of conservatives hold their tongues when it's social justice activists who spout assertions that run contrary to scientific evidence.

A half million Syrians are dead and and 10 million+ are out of their homes. Assad could have prevented most of that. BTW, Obama yielded some but he also resisted  arming the rebels, against almost all advice (including HRC's), nearly the whole way through. Putin's involvement has made it much harder for him though.

0,"Correct me if I'm off on this, but haven't you said affirmative action has led to course/grade devaluation?  I know of know researched answer to that question.   I believe the devaluation comes from parents who believe grades are the link to success (mostly white), and start beating on teachers early in education to give their children better grades.    I know this, I've seen this, I know both parents and teachers who will reaffirm this.  Another way to devalue the admission is though 'legacy' or if not available, large donations.   A perfect example is President Trump.    He's clever enough to know education counts for most people and cunning enough to demand Obama's records while keeping his own private.  http://www.salon.com/2011/05/03/donald_trump_wharton/  Trump is hardly an unusual case in high priced schools.   Of course he lied about student achievements, but why would we expect otherwise.    Just more Wealth Privilege.

If US tax reform goes through, headquarters from Montreal, Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver will make plans to relocate south overnight. Trudeau is a champion of short-sighted symbolic puffery - broad idealism void of common sense and he would get another majority if there was an election today. Canada's growth industries are public sector unions and career activism.

He had a program stopping terrorists from entering the country-- Trump has not been able to put his own in place (he is getting closer). He brought some stabilization to Afghanistan and reduced US troops there (Russians are now aiding the Taliban there). He stabilized Iraq and with special forces has trained an effective Iraqi fighting force which has been winning the war against ISIS. His strategy has militarily gained a big advantage in the war in Syria and captured territory and put ISIS on the run. In Syria, he developed a successful military strategy combining the forces of the Kurds, Turks, Iraq, and several rebel groups in a coalition against ISIS that has been winning with US air support and bombing. He did this despite Republican opposition including stopping Obama's effort to increase military spending.

What he is trying to do is figure out why, despite the obvious deficiency in experience, that Trump continue to stay close in this election.  Now maybe he didn't get it right, but Trump has recognized there are a lot of people who are not voting, not involved in political issues at all and there is a reason why.  I've personally pointed out that modern elections are never, never, showing a winner a with a majority of eligible voters.   They may get a majority of those who voted, but never a majority of those who could vote.   Trump has found those adults, the disillusioned, the angry, the ones that feel they have no say in American policy.  Think about the teenager who behaves badly if for no other reason than to feel empowered to do something other than what their parents say.  Democrats are parents who expect compliance, 'for your good'.   That breeds resentment.

0,"jamesjohnson is clearly right, it is not the various media, who merely report on the investigation, it is the investigators themselves who continue the investigation of Russian interference in our last election. The investigators at the FBI, CIA and a number of other national security agencies, along with committees of both houses of Congress and a special prosecutor and his office. The Clintons were similarly investigated for years, culminating in charges of lying to a grand jury, resulting in the president's impeachment, which increased his popularity and political effectiveness and ruined the political career of Speaker Newt Gingrich, who led the impeachment . But the media can ruin careers, and the destruction of Hillary Clinton's career after thirty years of nonstop media lying is a prime example.

0,"Sarasit,  Unfortunately, in too many church bulletins there is already a Voters' Guide that lists that Donald Trump is anti-abortion and Hillary Clinton is not, therefore---he is pro-life.   Are our church leaders so blinded by Trump's manipulation about 'his truth' that they can not see the crass and demeaning underside of his campaign?  There is more to PRO-LIFE than just declaring """"I'm anti-abortion.""""  Insults hurled at fellow candidates' spouses and parents, mocking individuals with physical disabilities, trashing the sacrifices made by individuals for our nation, belittling people because of their ethnicity or religion, making incestuous comments about his own daughter, AND treating so many women from past and present as consumable merchandise for his taking----presents both parents and teachers of children and youth with horrific issues not present at the last election of a president.   Frankly, our church leaders really aren't saying much of anything to help.

Gallup 37% Home News 35% Real Clear Politics 39.9% Associate Press 36% The highest found other than Rasmussen a far leaning right wing poll 42% . According to Trumps tweets, his approval rating 50% is even greater than Obama's 56% according to Rasmussen polls. Once again even his ego is equal to his rating rating claims, both inflated. .

Also, Trump may soon make an Executive Order directing that a 6 month review (specifying changes the US must insist on) begin concerning all US trade agreements, including NAFTA and under WTO,  Thus, if Trump makes the 6 month review order, then Canada and Mexico must seek clarification at the highest level of US goals and, if adequate assurances aren’t given that the review will not result in new demands in 6 months and that an Article 2205 will not be made while NAFTA negotiations continue, declare that they are no longer prepared to commence NAFTA negotiations unless and until the US commits to negotiate without threats and on a stable, reasonable and equitable basis.

Keep in mind also that the Alt-Right isn't a Southern group either, base is nationwide as guys who went to Charlottesville came from Arizona, Ohio, even Quebec. They chanted Anti-Semitic slogans and were heavily weaponized. There wasn't a regional faction to it, it was a racist white supremacist rally, emboldened by the Trump White House.

Propose a 3 to 5% surcharge on those with incomes of at least $1 million per year and take that money and reinvest into the economy, forcing the money into the hands of the middle class, thereby driving spending and economic activity.

Too bad the middle class hasn't seen their incomes increase 280% . Uber class has proven over and over, they prefer to squander that money into financial accounts.

He didn't even punch potholes in the runways, as Syrian planes were using them again in hours. T-rump has too many investments in Russia to risk real hostilities.

I think that when Trump is """"in the moment,"""" he can convince himself of anything.  He changed his view on abortion when he decided to run for president as a Republican. He changed his view on waterboarding because he no longer needs it as a campaign issue. The same is proving to be true of prosecuting Hillary Clinton, financing the border wall, etc.  Some might call that flexible pragmatism. I call it opportunism.

The liberal media also went nuts criticizing and mocking Melania Trump because she wore high heel shoes while on her way to the Marine One helicopter on the White House grounds.  A disaster of epic proportions is occurring in Texas and the media is more concerned about what Mrs. Trump is wearing at the White House.

When the last two Republican nominees for president, Mitt Romney, and John McCain, say they won't attend the GOP convention. Neither will the last two Republican presidents, George W, and His daddy, George H. W.  The GOP is badly divided. A divided party does not win elections. They are reaping what they sowed.

Bayrock Capital, where he worked was located in Trump Tower and he himself worked as a special advisor to Trump.  Mr. Sater was convicted and sent to prison in 1993 after a New York bar fight in which he stabbed a man in the face.. That was a matter of public record. However, what few people beyond insiders at Bayrock knew was that five years later, Mr. Sater was implicated in a huge stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals — and that he became a confidential F.B.I. informant.

0,"It is not only Donald Trump's war on reality. . Big Oil has waged war on reality for 30+ years.  That is what climate change denial is all about.  Remember the Harper government? . Right-wing success is based on convincing low-information voters, particularly white rural male votes, to vote against their own economic interests. . A common medium for that purpose is some kind of hot button distraction - abortion, guns, immigration, gay marriage, Islamophobia, etc., - that is of huge prejudicial effect, but of little economic harm. . Thus evangelical Christian voters enable climate change denial and administrative capture of government agencies - e.g., the NEB or the EPA - by oil companies. . Do evangelical Christians hate the planet? Why would they? . Yet the right-wing obsession with e.g., abortion, has the practical results of preventing action on problems of enormous importance such as (a) climate change, and (b) building public transit. . Donald Trump did not invent this game.

0,"Trump made fun of women's appearances. He made fun of women's periods. His infamous line: """"grab 'em by the p****""""  And despite all of this: He won 53% of the white female vote 45% of college educated female voters 42% of women's votes overall And 9 million more women than men vote in the US election.  Women had the opportunity to break the biggest glass ceiling in the world and vote for a female candidate that was also the globe and fail's preferred candidate as they have constantly reminded us after the election, but chose not to. The biggest whiners, Ms. Renzetti, are reserved for those who participated in the women's march the day after he was elected and could not accept the result of a democratic election.

It is also my understanding that Bill Clinton actually performed many of those acts, I point to his molestation of an intern in the Oval Office as an example.

The Republicans are so psycho-politically unstable there's no reason the Democrats should not own the political center.

0,"Trump likes to play games with the media and the Democrats, but I felt Trump does believe his intel people and the bipartisan word from Congress-- Russians hacked the election and social media to sway the election his way. Until now he would not say it but he believes his intelligence officials and key Republicans that have told him what happened. His scolding Putin proves it. He threw media off, but we now know what Trump really thinks. More recent proof-- look at all the campaign advisors and his campaign manger Manfort and national security advisor Michael Flynn that he has fired or disowned. He stopped teasing when it counted.

0,"That's a desperate excuse, topped off with an ad hominem attack.  Obama supplying weapons to Mexican drugs lords is obviously a deeply shocking revelation- even if it's not technically illegal for him to do so. One might even call it """"outrageous,"""" and one can understand why he'd invoke executive privilege to keep it from the public eye.  However, Donald Trump has not invoked executive privilege, even though the information involved is alleged to be personally damaging against him.  I don't think it's a false equivalency to compare a president's action in one case, and non-action in another. The examples speak clearly to the character of each.

0,"If Canada trades with countries with ridiculously low labour costs and standards, downward pressure will be applied to living standard of segments of the Canadian private sector. The public sector worker benefits from the lower costs of increased supply and increased competition. The gap between the private and public sector compensation continues to grow. The inflated public sector costs exacerbates our inefficiency.  Immigration of low skilled workers also applies downward pressure to wages in some private sector segments but once again the public sector worker is isolated from the negative affects. I have no problem with attempting to raise the standard of living of the less fortunate through trade, in fact I believe we have no choice if we wish for Mankind to survive. The earth cannot support the Canadian lifestyle when extended to the rest of Mankind. We should all share the burden. of this downward pressure. Both Sanders and Trump campaigned on this injustice.

Bleeding America to feed Vietnam hardly can be seen to benefit American in long term, since Vietnam can change its face one night, to benefit itself, just like Philippine did or Vietnam itself did many times in past history. The TPP is dead, it can't come back.

And YES there were TWO groups fighting, which he stated and its a FACT.  FYI - The Democrats had a KKK leader in the senate for 4 decades who was Clinton and Obama friend. And the truth is the Democrats are the party of hate.  There were a few hundred white nut jobs out there and they DO NOT represent the GOP, Americans or myself or any sain person.

So getting all giddy about emails released a day before the DNC convention ( on purpose no doubt)  most likely by Trump's bromance, Putin, is what the conversation really is about.

He's great with slogans & can hype the fan base, but he's like a cream puff; you poke it & all the air is let out. He's too thin-skinned & just plain mean. He's not qualified to be President.

0,"Trump doesn't know what he's going to say from minute to minute, and it has little to do with what is in his head.  He's engaged in a delaying action, buying time.  His ultimate agenda has never been one he could share with Congress or the American people.  It is about his own increased wealth, access to 24-hour flattery,  and permanent unlimited power, and he believes he knows how to get it. He just has to fool us long enough.

The old guard in Palm Beach was outraged that Donald would accept blacks and Jews so that’s the real Donald Trump that I know.”  That was author Ronald Kessler in a July 2015 interview with Newsmax...

Indeed, many experts believe that NK could kill hundreds of millions of Americans now with the WMDs they definitely have.  NK is closely allied with other tyrannical police states such as Syria & Iran with whom they have cooperated on WMD weaponry.  Sanctions/diplomacy are not going to halt NK's acquisition of H-bombs and ICBMS.  Russia & China may well want NK to have WMD capability and destroy the US so that a Sino-Russian alliance could expand throughout the world.  The best option for the US now is to develop boost-phase interceptors to counter enemy ICBMs and to inform Americans that the enemies who may well kill 100s of millions of Americans are not named """"Trump.""""  These NK threads are incredible for the lack of criticism bloodthirsty tyrants like KJU receive while always heaping abuse on our """"man in the arena.""""

These US citizens are a significant portion of the expense (education, food stamps, etc). They are here because of illegal immigration, but it should be noted that they are citizens.  On a related question... how effective will Trump's wall be in stopping illegal immigration, and will the reduced flow be worth the opportunity cost of the billions to build the wall? Trump's budget has gutted many programs to pay for the wall, will the increase in jobs from stopping immigration offset the loss of jobs due to NIH cutbacks? Will the loss of Amtrak devastate bedroom communities more than the presence of illegal aliens? I don't think the wall will stop illegal immigration, and I don't think the cost of the wall is worth the cuts needed to build it. We will be worse off, not better.

After a week of Trump not even mentioning Puerto Rico, there has been another week where Trump has been just flat out lying about how everything was going great. That's a lie. But of course, Trump lies all the time, and about Puerto Rico it's more of the same, just lies. Trump has been golfing, three trips this past week, 3 of the last 3 days and more golf tomorrow. The abject failure appears to be a trifecta of Trump's utter incompetence, lack of urgency on the part of the Trump administation and the sheer magnitude of the damage.

0,"John, I have a newsflash for you concerning the lousy ratings you cite for the seasonal launches of several CBC programs.  The newsflash is that CBC produced programs almost always get lousy ratings whether the US president happens to be Trump or Carter.  Your column reminds me of when a new and aggressive reporter confronted the legendary Cecil B DeMille in the 1950s with the observation that Hollywood films """"these days"""" are generally really terrible.  DeMille calmly asked the young reporter to at least admit that sometimes, perhaps not often, but sometimes Hollywood actually made a good movie.  When the reporter after a moment agreed that very occasionally Hollywood made a good movie, DeMille responded, """"Well, we don't have to!"""".  This, John, sums up the CBC dilemma.  Everyone from cast to producer, director, cameramen, etc. know the CBC is heavily subsidized by the government.  So the need to identify with and respond to customer tastes and the sense of urgency is missing.

Trump would allow corporations that have stashed their profits overseas to pay just a fraction of what the companies owe in federal taxes.  And then he would allow the companies to “invest” in infrastructure projects in exchange for even more tax breaks.

The next four, were 5/2009, 2/2013 (timed with Obama's State of the Union Address), 1/2016 and 9/2016. BTW the last nuclear device was estimated at 10-kilotons and ten times the strength of the 2006 device.  NK also launched an ICBM from a submarine in early-2016. I skipped the bevy of missile launches. Obama had 8 years and we have nuclear armed NK. Trump has 7 months. My guess is that this game of """"war chicken"""" with KJU will go on until NK makes on provocation too many. Yet everything NK has done was solely at the direction of China.

When she spoke out against Trump, got shouted down for it by her braindead fellow Republicans, that created a lot of """"umph"""" for us to accept her, no questions asked.  But because we have a process to review such switches, it took some time. Beth was determined to  take as long as necessary to address everyone's concerns, to NOT """"rush it.""""

Trump made Keystone a campaign issue and therefore withholding it (and the small PR victory) ought to give us some small leverage.  More importantly, this would be a reminder that if NAFTA is ripped up, the proportionality clauses go with it, and Canada will no longer be obligated to send a percentage of its oil and gas production to the US (making KXL much less valuable).  Canada would then be free to sell Oil to Canadians first and reduce the oil imports that NAFTA necessitates.  Withholding Keystone while pushing through projects like Trans Mountain and Energy East signals that we are serious about selling our oil elsewhere - and we're going to need every advantage in the upcoming trade negotiations.

0,"You must be a psychiatrist to be able to label Trump a narcissist, but that aside, there is nothing which prevents almost anyone from holding office including the President.  In some ways, I believe most Presidents have those tendencies or they probably would not have sought that office in the first place, and in many ways, it is probably what this country of """"diverse"""" points of view needs!

It is reflected in just about every comment made on this thread.  I hate to say it, but it lays out for us how incapable this organization is of producing any sort of reform that has real meaning to it.  Will this mobilize a greater reform movement of the laity?  Will this produce the outcry from the majority of the Church that shakes the rafters of the Vatican City buildings?  Will there be demonstrations in St. Peter's Square like the marches in resistance to Trump?  Sad to say, I doubt it.  Catholics, like other religions, simply withdraw under such conditions, and leave completely (""""nones"""") or stay based on """"I like my parish priest.""""

They have forgotten that unless they are of Indigenous descent, they too were descended from immigrants and refugees.  Indeed, with the rise of the fortress mentality of the 'alt-right' movements in the US, Europe and Canada, they feel free to express their 'Trumpistic' hatreds, ignorance and vacuity.

0,"Mike thanks for your willingness to dialogue on the issues.  As to the SCOTUS picks, I would agree that it is unlikely that the courts will ever reverse Roe v. Wade.  However, strict constructionist judges have proven far more willing to allow states to impose restrictions on abortion, such as ultrasounds, which I believe have been key to some of the reduction we appear to be seeing.  However, the stronger argument is internationally.  The Mexico City policy, which was created by President Reagan, prevented US dollars from supporting abortion abroad.  It was reversed by Clinton and Obama, but upheld by both George H. W. and George W. Bush.   Paying for abortion abroad likely has a more immediate impact than anything done domestically.   Thus if Mr. Trump reimposes the Mexico City policy, I would see this as a major win.  But like you, I will need to wait and see, and offer lots of prayer in the meantime.  God bless.

Conclusion) This whole election cycle isn't about hacks, or leaks, or racism or xenophobia. That is all media manipulation taking the emphasis off the fact that Clinton and the Democrats were weak. I am no Trump Supporter but after the Democrats did what they did to Bernie (whom I financially supported beginning in 2015), I was glad they lost.

Is that too much to ask? Apparently for Trump it is, since in those returns we will no doubt find that he's in deep hock to some really nasty people and has dragged the entire country into the muck with him. This would certainly be personally embarrassing for Trump, but since the American people have a right to know whether their president owes money to hostile foreign powers, I believe the time has come for someone to issue a subpoena in order to force him to turn over that information whether he likes it or not. The time for the American people to know the truth is now. Release those tax returns!

What gave the Republicans """"cover"""" was the fact the Democrats controlled Congress at the time, and that the republican members would be powerless to stop impeachment proceedings..  One other thing, the impeachment would have been based upon the cover - up, bot the actual break - in itself...  Same thing here...

Of course, Comey might have refused and then Trump would have had to fire him with cause (insubordination) but without a good explanation to the court of public opinion.  2) Comey could have refused to meet Trump one on one, but it seems that both men were 'hedging' and checking the other out.  In conflict resolution situations with the 'boss' who does one go to if there is a problem, Ivanka , Jared, or Bannon?  3) Trump could have simply announced that interference by a foreign power in a US election is unacceptable and ordered measures to prevent any possible future reoccurence.

To draw some $167 billion to jumpstart the $1 trillion, 10-year infrastructure plan, Washington would grant a giant tax break “equal to 82 percent of the equity amount.” The goal isn’t fixing bridges so much as fixing the corporate tax codes to promote privatization and unregulated construction with virtually no public input.

While Mueller's task is very broad and open to some interpretation, he started with an assumption of Trump's team colluding with the Russians in an attempt to influence the election.  Yet, the net result after 9+ months of investigation... 1) individual plead guilty to lying to a federal agent.  2) individuals who were part of Trump's campaign were arrested for something tied to their work before Trump's campaign and tied to the Podesta Group.  If Mueller ignores the dossier and doesn't investigate the DNC and Clinton's campaign, then calling for his ouster would, IMHO, be justified.

Further, assume Obama had dinner with the Head of the FBI seeking reappointment and it is alleged (not proven) that Obama asked for a pledge of loyalty and asked if he was under investigation. I think that the Republicans would move to impeach Obama (and rightfully so). The charge would be Obama's offering or accepting a bribe which under the constitution calls for impeachment. The Obama bribe is a job for a pledge of loyalty and assurance Obama is not under investigation or a Obama's acceptance of a bribe of loyalty and assurance re investigation for a job. There would be an investigation as a result (the President cannot be charged for a crime then investigated, but must be impeached by Congress then investigated). Think about that.

It's beyond foolish to assume the same sentiment that elected Trump is not present here, we share many similarities with the US.  Extremist policies?

Maybe the problem is your definition of what constitutes an extremist policy....

0,"Re: the article about Boehner in Wapo, here's the comment which got the second highest number of likes:  """"Boehner is chasing the horse after he already let it out of the barn. As far as I'm concerned, he's complicit in the behaviors and strategy of Herr Trump, Ryan, McConnell, and the rest of the GOP cesspool that infests D.C.""""  The comment with the highest number of likes reminded readers that while Boehner sneered at his successor's inability to pass Trumpcare, Boehner himself presided over 50 votes to repeal Obamacare, knowing all the while that Republicans would have nothing with which to replace it.  Contra MSW, I like Boehner even less after having read that article, but that's not saying much because I pretty much detested him while he was Speaker of the House.

0,"I said it many months ago: Trump is a mentally unstable egomaniac. Whatever support he may have in this country won't change who or what he really and truly is. As this article implies, he will pander to whomever he happens to be speaking to at that particular moment, he doesn't have an ounce of originality and he obviously doesn't have a clue how the government works. Unless someone can and does reel him in, we're in for a rough ride.

0,"This WaPo story's headline has “phony Vietnam con artist” in quotes, inferring Trump's statement was inaccurate, but then contradicts itself by stating """"The Connecticut lawmaker, a Marine Corps reservist during Vietnam, had to apologize for saying he had served in the war.""""  Blumenthal indeed lied about serving in Vietnam, and he actually obtained at least five military deferments from 1965 to 1970.  Trump was right, but the WaPo knows most people just scan headlines without reading the story, and will move on falsely believing Trump was lying.  Business as usual for the dishonest liberal media.

0,"Can't speak for the morons on either side of the aisle.  This was a looming problem back around 2003, and neither the Repubs or Dems acknowleged it.  The first set of sanctions under the GW admin was 2006, and all it did was accelerate their development.  It's easy to see through history that our bullying has done nothing to fix the issue but only makes it worse.  It's the same in the middle east, it was the same with N. Korea.  The smart thing to do was take a different approach.  If I want you to cooperate, I don't start punching you and your family in the nose.  I do nice things for you.  I help you out.  Since China wasn't on board back then, the only approach would be to offer a kind hand.  Now?  It's beyond repairable.  China on board now is the closest thing to a solution.  Problem is Kim might be over the edge.  Trump's bullying is making it worse.

0,"Donald Trump made accusations all the time with no professional experience or even a reasonable rationale.  His crusade about Obama's birth certificate comes to mind.  Trump based his whole campaign on assuming what others knew or didn't know or just plan wanted to hear.  Dog whistles everywhere.  I will not give Trump any benefit of political correctness nor will I play by a set of rules he doesn't recognize as having any importance.  The man should never have been elected president, but he was because too many people chose to assume he was sane and thought he was just 'telling it like it was'.

0,"Well said.  Anything whatsoever to do with Trump and any even mild support for him on anything brings out the left wing fanatics to make a farce out of Civil Comments.  The observation that he is a fine golfer who has won numerous club championships and has a single digit handicap (even more impressive for a septuagenarian) leads to all manner of vitriol  at Trump and at anyone who observes that less than 80 days in it is premature to declare that his presidency is a failure.  He cheats at golf, he isn't really a good golfer, he didn't really win club championships, as a graduate of Wharton he can't spell, he is a total failure as POTUS, posters here and voters by the millions who supported him are deplorables who require an IQ boost of at least 20 points, yadda, yadda, yadda  This level of irrational, obsessive blind hatred gives the lie to the claim that this is now the Civil Comments section.

0,"The appeal court is not setting precedent, it is following precedent at the decision pointed out citing case law.

Similar claims of absolute presidential discretion and curtailing court review even in immigration and national security matters have been rejected in the past as the appeal court laid out citing case law.

The GOP don't need an economic program;  they just burn the cross and watch the whites line up and the votes roll in.

What's really happening is the unmasking of all the underhanded colluding Madame Clinton was involved in with the Clinton Foundation, the bribery accepting, extorting, etc. while she was in office under the libby's favorite guy Barrack.  I'm seeing all the CNNs, MSNBCs, Vox's, Huffington Posts change their focus now that the real colluding culprits are being exposed as a result of the fictional dossier.  60,000 feet looking down, President Trump plain didn't have the time or the means available to him to do all the colluding that the Dems and libbies are suspicious of....the physical means just are not there like they are for the Clintons.   The foreign meddling here is clearly against the Republicans. I see this investigation going the wrong way for the Dems and the DNC.  That's what will end it.  Oh...and they'll keep losing elections as a consequence...
"
0,"I agree.  If Trump were to single out a religious group qua religious group, that would be wrong.  If Trump were to oppose immigration by Mexicans on grounds of race, that would be even more wrong.  But you assume he hates both groups, and as much as I """"dislike"""" Trump (to put it mildly), I just don't have the evidence to say he hates them, or wants to discriminate against them on the basis of religion or race. Take the travel ban.  Yes, strictly against Muslim countries.  But not ALL Muslim countries, and it affects a relatively small percentage of Muslims --- those from countries that pose the most significant threat of terrorism.  If he wanted to discriminate against Muslims qua Muslims, he did a pretty bad job of it.  And the ban is only temporary, until the people affected by it can be properly vetted.  Given the risks that terrorists pose, that's not unreasonable, not when almost every significant act of terrorism in the world is accompanied by shouts of """"Allahu Akbar.""""
"
0,"I agree that the GOP is in the middle of a civil war between the conservative elites and their base of """"poorly educated"""" """"deplorables"""". The based were never conservatives, they cared more about being white than any policy issues the elites care about. The civil war started when Obama got elected. The elites had spent 50 years promising their base that any body black would ever be president. Then the base figured out that the elites invited all that illegal labor here for fun and profit. That made sure that the GOP base would revolt. When they won control of the House and Senate they were suppose to get rid of Obama. That didn't happen and enraged the GOP base. Trump has spent his entire life take advantage of people. He can spot a mark from a mile away. He loves the """"poorly educated"""" because they are so easy to con. They even send him money. He only loves one thing, himself.

It's so easy to trot out the """"he refuses to be politically correct"""" excuse for the appeal of Trump but it probably has much more to do with the social psychology of the aging, white male than anything else.

Johnson, a disgraced former CIA analyst and spreader of racist rumors targeted against Michelle Obama. 3.

"
0,"Trump is skilled at misdirection and deception, and this article's writer, Ms. Giaretelli, either approves of that approach or is easily fooled by it. What trump tweeted are two distinct and for this discussion, unrelated matters. First, despite what a careless reading of trump's tweet might suggest, Schumer did NOT suggest zero evidence of Russian interference in the election- that's just trump's claim, inserted before the Schumer message. Second, Schumer's point was that the most productive approach to winning future elections would be stronger Democratic Party messaging and candidates (rather than relying upon becoming fixated upon Russia's role in US election). Schumer's message in no way denies or dismisses the serious matter of Russian interference in the US political process- it's just a more broad, proactive emphasis. Still, I suppose that trump (with his skilled mishmash talk) and the WE will have their way with uncritical minds and readers.
"
0,"As with so many things Trump says it is difficult to differentiate any real policies he might plan on implementing from the senseless bluster.  The reality, of course, is that Trump doesn't have any authority at all to implement any new tax.  The U.S. Constitution very clearly states that all taxes MUST originate in the House of Representatives.  Now Trump could well find some allies in that House to champion his bills, but he himself certainly can't tax GM or any company.  Further the U.S. government, as a whole, can't unilaterally place an import tax on anything manufactured in Canada or Mexico for arbitrary reasons.  Doing so would be a blatant violation of NAFTA and would be akin to the U.S. unilaterally pulling out of that agreement.  The last time the U.S. did such a thing was 1929 when the Smoot-Hawley Tariff turned the recession of that year into The Great Depression.

0,"Most, if not all, of Trump's bankruptcies were Chapter 11 reorganizations, which are a restructuring of debt, usually by extending the term and lowering the rate.  It's not the same as a Chapter 7 in which you walk away from the debt.  It's a common tool used by businesses to improve their cash flow.  Trump did take some hits to his equity position, but those Chapter 11's didn't stiff the creditors.  They eventually got paid.  Most people who lose that much money ($960 million) give up and quit.  Trump was able to turn it around and become successful.  To my mind, that shows character.  Most of his more recent enterprises involved leasing the Trump trade name and selling management services without incurring any of the investment risk.  Some of those ventures went bankrupt, but Trump wasn't involved in the debt.  All he lost was the revenue streams from the trade name leases and the management contracts.
