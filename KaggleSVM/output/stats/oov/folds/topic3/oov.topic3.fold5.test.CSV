1,"What """"little tidbit?""""  When you are grabbed by the genitals without warning by a sexual predator that is not """"permitting"""" anything.   """"According to legal documents, Trump has been accused of raping a 13-year-old child, raping his ex-wife, and attempting to rape a former business associate. He vehemently denies all of these accusations—and it should be noted anyone can file a civil complaint in court, and a complaint is by no means proof of allegations. That being said, the accusations are chilling...The first and most famous accusation comes from Trump’s ex-wife Ivana Trump. During a deposition in the ’90s, Ivana described a harrowing scene in which Trump held her arms back, pulled at her hair, and raped her in a fit of rage. She herself used the word “rape.”....""""  then there's the 1997 lawsuit  filed by Jill Harth for unwelcome sexual advances and """"attempted rape""""...the 3rd lawsuit was filed this year, wherein a woman claims she was raped by Trump when she was 13 years old.

0,"I have neither the time nor the inclination to watch reality TV so yes, I didn't watch the Apprentice and I sincerely doubt I missed much doing so. That said, I'm talking more about the business brand, namely the hotels and in this case Ivanka's product line which really is trying to compete with more prestigious brands that carry weight.  People today aren't keen too stay in Trump Hotels or buy clothing or handbags from the First Daughter. Anyone remember when Trump was shilling mattresses?  lol!  I knew few people that were in the market for a new bed keen to go buy something with his name on it. So yes, the brand is in decline.

Hit piece!"""", why don't you go through the article, address each subject, and explain why you think the people who don't agree with Trump's policies got it wrong.

"
0,"In order to discourage a """"back-channel"""" for personal gifts to Trump, the courts could consider impose average cost pricing on Trump hotel nightly rates, as they do in regulated monopolistic industries.  As a back channel for gaining, or buying preference, a foreign government or lobby group could rent out entire floors of expensive suites in Trump's hotels or facilities on slow days, with no intention of occupying them, thus funneling money to the president. Legal? Sort of, yes, but certainly not ethical and highly unconstitutional.  Under average cost pricing regulation, the hotels would only be able to charge an effective rate equivalent to their average total cost per rental. It wouldn't eliminate the problem but it would reduce the incentive and the impacts. The rationale of applying regulations is based on the market power and monopoly rents of the Trump organization, which as the attorney generals point out, impacts the competitiveness of their local hospitality industry.

Many Priests! Mine won't say...but he wears it on his sleeve, and it is very uncomfortable at my Church these days. I am in the minority for sure. I feel like the little boy that called out the Emperor has no clothes...but everyone else thinks he does! It has been very disheartening, and I wonder how to get back to normal with my Church community. I have seen a side of people, I wish I hadn't witnessed. I have to remind myself that it comes from some deep fear inside of them, maybe something I don't understand. Anyway, I will pray and vote of course, and then pray some more for all of us.

0,"Agreed Mitchell Andrew: (goog) Trump presidency has big implications for Alaska oil development KTOO. Lisa just a blowin her horn. My comment to KTOO.  Sorry folks but Lisa did not vote for Donold nor support him and in fact called for him to resign. If you want to make headway with oil development you may want to look to the people here in Alaska that worked 7x12/16 per day and confrencing every morning with Trump along with all the other lower 48 Campaign Managers. See Jerry & Margaret Ward of Ward Realty here in Anchorage. This was all about the grass roots not the elitest that think they can cozy up at the end of the line. Look, Jerry had a 1/2 hr meeting with President Trump when he was in WA. I dont beleive Lisa has ever met the man. Remember what this is all about- #draintheswamp. The Trump Train left the station and her and Dan Sullivan stupidly threw their tickets away. Are Lisa & Dan going to be first to have his ear about Alaska. Id say no. Sarah/Todd are in NY transition

Trump tweets complaint about Sessions """"witch hunt"""".  http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-cries-witch-hunt-russia-questions-pile-n728611  --  Okay, I can see the Wizard Of Oz analogy  Jeff Sessions being the Wicked Witch Of The West.

"
0,"Sadly, this will not be Trumps fault. Yes, he brings things to a head but this has been coming for many decades now. Our wars are not fought for human rights, they are fought for corporate greed and the right to exploit the natural resources of other countries. Human rights issues are just the carrot on the end of a stick that leads us to war.  The Republican party has been grossly ineffective for a long time now but I don't fault them alone. I don't know what Americans even think any more. They don't show up to vote nor do they even care about our governments at any level unless something might be taken from them. The fact that the parties won't even debate the issues and only argue from a distance, tells me how broken our political system has become.  A civil war is not the answer but it could come to pass. Who will we be at war against? All politicians, perhaps? Maybe all corporations that run our government? Who is to die?
"
0,"Trump now """"owns"""" Obamacare, because it is the law of the land, and as President, he is charged with administering it and enforcing it. There are things he can do as President to see to it that it functions as intended. Obamacare is not going to blow up or fail, unless Trump lets it or causes it to. Studies, including one by Standard and Poor and reported on both Fox and CNN states that the insurance market is improving and stabilizing and Obamacare is not in danger of failing. What would help beyond that are some changes to the small segment of patients who buy single policies on the market. Trump can make some of these and some can be made by Republicans and Democrats if Trump can unite them.

If you can't make the protest, then call your legislators and urge them to stand up to big oil, coal, natural gas and then let's all get as local as we can, buy electric vehicles powered by solar panels, bus, walk, bike and reuse and reduce our resources.  With Trump as President- the anti-science climate denier-- it will be up to US to be the adults and make the changes needed.  Time is quickly running out before runaway climate change makes life on Earth at the very least unpleasant and at the worst uninhabitable.

0,"No surprise that Goldberg would consider that the idea of a universal, functional health care system in the U.S., similar to the Canadian system, is """"bonkers"""", because it would dramatically improve the lives of poor people.  The Trump was for implementing a Canadian-style health care system, before he was against it. No public reason has ever given for the shift, but it probably had to do with the Trump deciding to call himself a Republican.  Stephen J. Remington

0,"All Trump needs to do is have a Guaranteed Annual Income for the poor, cancel Medicare and Medicaid. Then all Americans would be in charge of their own lives. Health care would be just like all other parts of the economy. Americans would buy services they want which are within their means.  There would be complaints about the poor getting money but I suspect it would be far less than the people with money and tax breaks get. .

0,"The point is Trump didn't do anything of consequence. As someone said, it was basically a 59 missile tweet. Pure theatre. They were warned the attack was coming. Seven aircraft destroyed. Wow! Planes were taking off from the airport the next day.  This is a display of """"cojones""""?? Also, do you think someone who brags that he doesn't read books or reports can understand the Byzantine complexities of the Syrian civil war quagmire where more than a dozen different factions are fighting? And do you swallow the hypocrisy of Trump being moved by """"God's children,""""  but insisting, no, of course these poor souls can't be allowed in the U.S. Who knows what the Game Show Host President will do next.

0,"Dear Brooks, six months, even 6 days is a long  time for Lefty politicians. Before the firing Dems were condemning Comey and even calling for his head. Hillary still says he caused her to lose the election. Remember when Comey was a Trumpist in a federal windbreaker jacket. Some even hinted that the FBI was poliitcally compromised and out to get the Clintons. Mother Jones, that paragon of righteous virtue wrote: The FBI is full of middle aged white guys with anti Clinton bent due to their listening to 'lots of Rush Limbaugh. Now, post-firing Comey is viewed entirely differently, he has become almost a legendary figure, he is no longe ra Trunmp stooge, he is a falled memebr of the #resistance. He's been reimagined as the man who was about to bring down Trump. And you guys wonder why you lost the election, look inward for 90% of the reasons
"
0,"And they get much higher ratings when Trump is there than when he chooses not to be there.  And he continues to win supporters either way.  The media is not driving his train and that is a big part of the their angst.  Both the media and the Republican establishment fear an 'uncontrolled' candidate.  He doesn't need the 1 percenters money and he doesn't need the media's approval.  Bernie is a similar problem for similar reasons for the Democrats.  But they will anoint Hillary even if she is indicted and even if only the  Democratic SuperDelegates can make that happen.  She has already been bought and paid for and they want their money's worth.
"
0,"Does anyone doubt that as Mueller gets closer to the truth, the Trump will try to trump up the case for another military misadventure in an effort to prevent the ouster of a sitting President in wartime? Does anyone doubt that he’s crazy enough to plow headlong into nuclear war with North Korea, reasoning that if he ultimately goes down, he’ll take as many people as possible with him? Does anyone doubt that thousands of lives would be lost in a politically motivated war? There is nothing morally or legally inappropriate or improper about the prospect of using impeachment as a means to remove an objectively wayward President from office before that objectively wayward President takes an action that ends mass numbers of lives. Impeachment and removal from office is the only way to stop this nightmare from becoming reality. It’s the only way to contain the spread of this virus.

0,"Guess the reality is that if Obama had acted on his 'red line' bluff during the gas attacks in 2013, two years before the Russians popped into Syria, the world would not be in this mess.  This includes Crimea, Ukraine, South China Sea, Iran and on and on it goes - Obama and Kerry were an absolute disaster on the foreign policy front.   Odd that the UN still hasn't commented on these gas attacks in Syria... it is now 3 days later and the Useless Nations can't even agree to vote on a resolution condemning the attack...the UN must be disbanded!   By the way, good on ya Donald Trump as sometimes diplomacy does not work, especially when gassing children.
"
0,"The Dump Trump movement has an uphill battle but still a chance of success.  RC has controlled the narrative either by bullying (verbal abuse and lawsuits) or by lying/deflecting issues. Many of his critics have weaknesses which he exploits with ease.  For example, he accused Mainstream Media of being fake news. MM is guilty of embellishing the facts a bit too much, making them vulnerable to such critiques.  However, as a result of RC's attacks they are cleaning up their act, implementing fact checking procedures. With this new emphasis it will become ever easier for MM and others to attack him.  Meanwhile RC is not changing his style, still spewing garbage on twitter and abusing his status to make political speeches to non political audiences (graduation classes and Boy Scouts). Unless he changes he will become too big an irritant to ignore.  Under current conditions I give him a year.
"
1,"What a ridiculous conclusion to jump to, Ms. Parker.  What Trump said is that if Kim Jung Il asked to meet with him, he would be glad to do so (considering he is speaking on behalf of the country who by and large would not like to enter into a nuclear war with N. Korea)!
"
0,"Dolphin, please read carefully when Trump proposes tax breaks. Watch who those changes really help. For example, Obamacare, which Trump hates, imposes a 4% tax on taxable incomes over $250,000 per year. It uses that tax to help make insurance affordable for the rest of us. And watch carefully what he does for jobs. The per-month average increase in employment so far this year is no better than Obama, Clinton, Reagan, and several others. And pay raises? Let's watch the numbers. Here's me hoping you're right about what he is """"going to help."""" I have my doubts.
"
0,"It seems to be a pattern . Democratic Presidents like Clinton and Obama  cut the deficit (during his term Obama cut the deficit by 76% from $1.4 Trillion with Bush in 2009 to $587 Billion at the end of his term in 2016) and Republican Presidents like Bush increase it. It looks more like Trump will increase it with spending and with tax cuts.

Most Americans are concerned with ourselves, our loved ones, our friends and relatives. Our top concerns tend to be 1) our safety, and 2) our ability to bring in enough money to live our lifestyle. That's all. The appeal of President Trump that sets him apart from politicians is that he is RESULTS-ORIENTED. Therefore his objective as an elected DC Representative of the people is to achieve the results to allow Americans to prosper. Call that what you will.

The FISA Court said the illegal searches were “widespread” and “created a serious Fourth Amendment issue.” What this says is basically, Obama authorized the spying on American citizens. I would guess many are in the Trump campaign or administration not to mention Bernie Sanders as well. The weenies concerned about Russian interference with our elections should be outraged. We are doing to ourselves what the Russians, in their wildest dreams, couldn’t do. They must be laughing their a$$es off.

Will the coal miners going back to work in the US under a Trump presidency or the Albertans supplying bitumen to the Kinder Morgan pipeline ever be satisfied?

I said that Kelly the new chief of staff was already proving to be a strong leader of the WH staff and was jettisoning those who did not fit (e.g. Bannon and The Mooch) and would be bringing in those who did fit.  I did not indulge in Trump bashing because the focus was on changes in the WH staff and what this can mean.  As to being delusional, please indulge me by comparing the Trump and Trudeau cabinets in regard to relevant experience and accomplishments.  That should be a ton of fun and establish who is delusional on this subject.  Why not start by comparing General Mattis and Maryam Monsef?

This also works by addition too, when school district's get a hard-on for requiring """"creationism"""" indoctrination to be taught along side science. Got to hand it to Trump & Company though. Their cons are some of the best out there, second to those of the hard core folk who take the Bible literally and demand it be taught to EVERYONE. Ever been to a Baptist Revival meeting? I mean a real honest to goodness, down south, rollin in the aisle kind? This once beaten down soul has. Too many to count as a child, adolescent & young adult. Peace & Light Comrade!

1,"And Trump was elected to get rid of Obamacare, and that is what he is working on, because other people did have this garbage shoved down their throats. What it is going to take is a  bipartisan healthcare reform that can pass Congress with a minimum of 70% of the Congressional members until that time this back and forth with all of this resentment will continue.

0,"The interesting thing would be whom Trump can recruit to bark for Americans, given his personality (extremely loathed and mistrusted by anyone there), or he simply has to bark himself?  American may find themselves so lonely there since WW2 , probably in Europe as well.

0,"It is high time for more than words from the Alaska delegation on this grave matter, and to date, that is all we have had from the delegation.  Mr. Young, your political defense of Mr. Trump is disappointing.  Our very democracy is at stake, and you all seem more interested in getting your pet projects approved than fully investigating the likelihood that a foreign adversary has so thoroughly corrupted our democracy.  Shame on all of you.

0,"WSJ: White House aides staged an unsuccessful Twitter 'intervention' to get through to Trump - He’s been largely silent since heading off to Saudi Arabia. With every channel broadcasting blaring headlines and graphics about possible obstruction of justice and the news his son-in-law may be a “person of interest” in the collusion investigation, how long can he restrain himself?    You just know he’s itching to reach for his phone and go off. Stay tuned.
"
1,"Another troll poll to try to change the mind of Trump supporters? When will they learn we are not Leftist lemmings.
"
0,"Blah blah blah  Yet more meaningless corporate propaganda.  How about the real impact on real people?  Why not disclose the job losses, the cuts in wages and the elimination of benefits? The flood of TFWs to take yet more jobs away from Canadians?  These trade deals, the people negotiating them and the people supporting them are out of touch and delusional.  What's the point of spending years negotiating these things only to have them cancelled because people quickly realize these deals are bad and vote in nationalist politicians like Trump to do away with them?  If Le Pen wins in France CETA is gone.  And that's  great for the 99% who pay the price for these elite friendly """"deals"""".
"
0,"all 50 state election officials have certified the vote and all of them have also said 'no illegal voting'.  this is totally about his ego and nothing more.  will i get used to Trump, not on your life, i'll be fighting the guy and his cronies all along.  this is just like the ego statement saying his inauguration crowd was bigger than Obama's, bull pucky, just look at the pictures, taken at the exact same time and from the same vantage point.  and the good one is the women's march was also bigger than his inauguration crowd.  the guys ego just can't let any of this go and the Trumpites just get sucked right in, amazing.

"
0,"If there's no problem, why are they covering it up.   As far as the Dems, you may recall they're not in power, whereas Trump's Russian ties may jeopardize the US national interest, especially in the Ukraine. Finally, read the August 2016 Time magazine article on Trump's many business ties to Russia.  It's on the web.

0,"The byproduct of protectionism is unemployment?  Trumps supporters  have a heck of a surprise coming down the pipe!

0,"I'm not interested in whether their thoughts stay their private business.  I am much more interested in whether they accept the divisive cultural consequences of their vote for Trump.  Some of them are getting really squishy about the consequences.  I guess that's a good thing in the long run.  The only question I have is if we will have a long run.

1,"The old Wicked Witch of the West will stop at nothing to be president.  I expect Trump to throw a bucket of water on the old bait!
"
0,"Speculating based on some liberal notion of what a Trump Supporter is like.  """"White Nationalist.""""  More liberal gobbledygook that is clearly marginalizing people, which is your want.  The outrageous implication that minorities don't have a strong sense of patriotism is insulting to say the least.
"
0,"The Dixiecrats were Dems because their grandparents had passed along to them the evils perpetrated upon them by the GOP during Reconstruction. I know that 1st hand having been in grade school in Texas in the 60s. That was the """"marrow"""" that Wallace stood for.  On the other hand, the northern Dems were much more about labor rights and the wars they had waged against the company forces that supported the GOP. Segregation was a relatively minor issue most areas in the north outside of the inner cities. I spent time as a Medical Resident in the Chicago area in the mid 80s and could not believe the degree of segregation there compared to the desegregation I had witnessed in Texas as I came of age in the 70s.  And yes, the Wallace racists have all gone full in with Trump and the GOP. Wallace was Trump's John the Baptist, to use a metaphor.
"
1,"What the emails establish is intent. Now Trump cannot continue to lie without making even more of a fool of himself. The Republicans don't know what to do since they all thought Hillary Clinton would win and so they could continue with politics as usual. But they failed to realize how much voters hated Hillary Clinton and how inept she was. This year has shown how unprepared and stupid Republicans have been in power. A lot of the blame goes to Trump for his lack of leadership, his lack of knowledge, his poor behavior, and poor decision making. He should of focused on something simple like a tax cut that would be popular with most Republican voters.
"
0,"You seem to forget that Trump isn't another run-of-the-mill politician so only six months into his term he's still learning the etiquette of Washington. What matters is his agenda is on the right track and he's already making good on his promises and he's putting this country first for once. Trump is a very refreshing change after eight dark years under Obama. This is the beginning of a new era (finally) and as a bonus it is driving the Left bonkers. MAGA!

There is no First Amendment protection for releasing confidential and personal information.  That is why there is a federal law protecting someone's' tax returns from being made public without their permission.  Put her a-s is jail where it belongs.
"
0,"In fairness to Justin, he is probably just totally unaware of these alarming developments in China that you and I and many other curious and concerned Canadians have been following particularly since Trudeau signaled his intention to fast track free trade negotiations and a possible extradition treaty with China.  After all, as he revealed a few years ago he doesn't watch TV news or read the newspapers since if something important happens someone else will tell him about it.  Clearly, our Dear Leader is simply waiting for a Butts briefing on this and other matters, after which he will do something about this worrisome problem, maybe 30 days of no selfies with the Chinese leadership.  Meanwhile, our press and public is too busy to focus on this what with their feeding frenzy concerning whether one of Trump's kids met with some Russian for 20 minutes a year ago.

"
0,"What is it about Russia that attracts the Republican party and Trump voters beyond I suppose, their collusion to help get Trump elected?  Is it because they are an authoritarian regime, is that what attracts Republicans?

"
0,"My red flag went up with the headline: Is Trump immigration order un-American? Yes. Each of us has a concept of what un-American might be. This is a baloney story, full of biased assumptions, semi-truths, etc. It deserves little time, might make decent fire starter for my wood stove.
"
0,"The fat dictator is screwing nukes onto his ICBMs and Dan Sullivan wants Congress to tell Trump it is ok to Nuke NK? This Congress has less fortitude than a worm. And it is going to give a green light to taking out NK nukes. Give us a break Dan. The President has the authority to preemptively eliminate an imminent threat to the homeland.

Is there any doubt?

0,"Nobody has alleged that the Russians tampered with the election process.  The evidence suggests Russian hackers attempted to influence voters.

0,"I've always felt the Dispatch was totally one sided.  When we see things every day we don't really notice the big picture. I recently took a trip out of state for two weeks and when I returned I had two weeks of Dispatch papers to go through . It was stunning how day after day after day  after day there were about five to eight anti-Trump stories per day.  Never any good one's or one's that just stuck to the facts. If one read the Dispatch one would think Trump is the most evil person on the planet. That is why local liberals are so insane in their hate of Trump to the point they have been brainwashed so that they can't see anything else.  You notice how North Korea gets very , very few comments, none from liberals ,  knocking North Korea over their testing of rockets and of boasting they will hit many locations ? Yet liberals want to blame Trump for warning N. Korea we will wipe them off the map if they dare try anything . Who's side are liberals on ? Solidly North Korea .That's sad.
"
0,"I love the idea of calling Trump a """"dully elected President."""" Well played!
"
0,"No we don't all realize it. I guarantee very few Trump fanatics are aware of that fact, but it wouldn't matter anyway. Trump fanatics have so much of their beliefs invested in Trump that it doesn't matter how bad he f***s things up, or even if he starts World War Three, and plunges the world into the dark ages part two. If Trump took a dump on any of his loyal fanatic's heads, they'd smile and brag about the hat he made personally for them. They've been trump'd, they're proud of it, and there's no going back.

"
0,"Trump has an Ace up his sleeve to smack down NK. Working with the EU, other progressive countries, notify all countries trading with NK they are in violation of UN sanctions.  These countries will have a choice to make. Continue to trade with NK and supporting NK's overseas workers sending money home and all coalition countries will stop trading with you. All investments in their countries will stop.  Any products en-route will be confiscated and destroyed at the ports. Further, these errant countries could find themselves cut out of the world's financial system.  NK's economy will be on its knees in no time as money flow stops.  Major decision. Continue to prosper or sink like North Korea.  Your call.
"
0,"I'm not a liberal. I'm against policies that target religions. Christian or otherwise.  You said Trump did not call for a """"complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country"""" I showed you that he did. You somehow think because he said """"until our leaders figure out what is going on"""" or because of terrorism that it's okay to do that. It's legally not.

0,"""""...The reality: Trump may be getting along with Russia at the expense of his perception by Americans....""""  Most accurate sentence in the entire article, with """"perception"""" being the operative word.  Americans react to garbage and ignore the substance.  Trump isn't much different in reality than many other politicians and predecessors, other than being brash and a blow-hard.  Americans react to that more than to substance.  It's why Americans bought into the whole """"war on terror""""...reality is terrorism threatened nothing of the sovereignty of the planet.  The result?  Trillions spent killing hundreds of thousands of innocents...and Americans still buy into it.  This country is getting what it deserves.

"
0,"OS,  I believe you are now starting to get to what Trump may be thinking.  Why not be """"more"""" aligned with a power that will actually do something as opposed to nations that want to talk one into a stupor?  A nation that will back up their declarations with real action?  Do you think that will make all the Western European nations that don't pay their bills for defense, fight when called upon, and don't have defense establishment to defend themselves from Andorra, let alone Russia to sit up and take notice?  This is an interesting realpolitik thought and definitely changes the rules of the game for everyone.
"
0,"Well see when the investigation(s) are done.  I think it's pretty funny that so many people act like there's no way Trump could have done anything wrong, when: 1) He is a serial adulterer. 2) He has been sued over 1400 times. 3) He admitted to committing minor forms of sexual assault. 4) He has filed bankruptcy numerous times. 5) He has trouble getting loans from American banks. 6) He has a history of stiffing people.
"
0,"True, but we shouldn't assume either. I didn't know that only Smith, Jones and Johnson sounding names were American. Every time a person with a Spanish last name does something wrong the immigration trumpets sound.

Can't we be more mature and leave race out?
"
0,"contributed to funds dedicated to providing these services.  It's an insurance concept and is self-supporting at this time.  To extend that self-supporting feature all that's needed is a raising of the $118,500 cap.  Right-wingers love to pervert the term """"entitlement"""" to become a perjorative.  It isn't.  When we address """"discretionary"""" spending, we see that, indeed, our bloated military spending precludes adequate funding of education, health care, infrastructure maintenance and development, parks services, housing assistance, employment development and thousands of other areas of domestic services.  The Trump folks don't wish to fund """"meals on wheels"""" but are supportive of dropping $16 million dollar MOABs in Afghanistan.  We need a nationwide conversation regarding our """"Guns or Butter"""" choices......  Gary Crum
"
0,"Can you explain to me how you believe that is in any way comparable to the crimes of DJTJ? Other than contradicting GOP apologists' claims that Trump Jr's crime isn't really a crime, the perpetrator in the Chinese donation case pleaded guilty and was sentenced, and it didn't involve Clinton. Seems to me that's strike three for your argument.

0,"I don't think the media understands what they are up against in Trump. Trump is not going to back down. The media did everything they could to make him lose and he still won. Now Trump has the bully pulpit and watch out. Go Trump Go!!!!
"
0,"True, the immigrants create employment, and tax revenue for the government.  But the locals never benefit from the employment directly, for the jobs newcomers create are filled by their own types.  The largest pool of unemployed - white unskilled masses, see no benefit. The only indirect payoff is increased money for social programs e.g. welfare. Some solace.  More than that, immigrants skew the culture to make the locals even less employable - they are largely unaware of the customs of the newcomers.  Immigration will  always be favoured by industry (lowers wages) and government (new revenue) but opposed by masses. Trump Nation, uneducated and unskilled, does not want Mexicans in because that it exactly the jobs the compete for.  Makes economic sense. Democracy be damned.

"
0,"Nice try.  Funny how, when the dossier was paid for by Republicans, it was """"to look into a number of GOP Presidential candidates"""", but when the Democrats were paying for it, it was """"to dig up dirt on Trump & co"""".  The bottom line is that the dossier was initiated, engaged and contracted by Republicans to """"dig up dirt"""" on a Republican, Trump, which you see as less onerous than when the Dems engaged an already ongoing process.  For the Dems to go after a Republican is natural, and vice versa, it's done every campaign.  But here we have Republicans trying to eviscerate Republicans and somehow that's less unethical than Dems doing normal due diligence.  As for """"Clinton and the democrats colluded with Russian agents"""", well,........ if you say so.  Oh....wait....I see that Mueller has just announced the first indictment(s) in his investigation of Russian meddling in the US election will be handed down this week.  And they wont be to Democrats.
"
1,"Nope, it's you. Uranium One is not a scandal, it's a nothing burger. To anyone who bones up on the facts, it's easy to unravel the twisted lies the right has spun over this, all while trying to gloss over the treasonous crimes of the Trump traitors.

If that's the case, then I don't see why that's such a bad thing, especially in the world we live in now.

0,"Just finished watching the Fox News opinion on the press conference. Not only is the president right for taking the lying (other guys) media to the woodshed, he has a 55% approval rating in the Rasmussen polling data. (Unstated, most of the others hover around 39%) The echo chambers are getting louder and more opaque to each other, it seems.  I think the reporters are learning to respond with the facts. I can only hope that the weight of such a pervasive denial of facts will convince the Republicans to impeach. I worry that the power of Trump is too delicious a drug for them to detox voluntarily.
"
0,"Absolutely right. This protest is purely an anti-Trump protest. And did Trump really call for the NFL to fire these guys as the article says? Well... not really. He said he'd like to see an owner do that, but that isn't exactly the same as ordering, requesting, or even suggesting to an owner to do that. He was't talking to owners. I think he was just expressing, using his non-PC rhetoric, that he felt the  protests were unpatriotic and pointless. The protests are the same as flipping off the country and all it's citizens. How does that help solve the problem? What exactly is the problem being protested? And what am I supposed to do about it? We have a media that has hyped up our emotions and is dividing us by digging these things up and blowing them out of proportion.

0,"I had until recently thought that Pence would eventually become POTUS, but that depends on the nature of the impeachment.  If Trump were to be impeached on connections to Russia, for example, wouldn't Pence's Vice-Presidency be fruit of the same foreign meddling? He was part of the same ticket, after all.  Stormy seas ahead, either way.
"
0,"That guy is incredibly biased.  He changes his methodology whenever it starts to get close or Trump starts winning (he actually admitted that on Twitter).  The inputs to his model are also biased polls (the samples are skewed towards Democrats), so the whole thing is nonsense.

0,"Don't even go there dude.  As soon you remove the free press you live in a complete dictatorship  Don't like what they say, don't read it.  You cannot shutdown the media.  If this happens further, Trump will go down in flames faster than you can say hello.  This will be his undoing if he doesn't learn.  You cannot do this in a democracy no matter how much you hate the press.
"
0,"In a parallel universe with a President that didn't feel the need to get all bent out of shape at any form of rejection, the White House would issue a statement saying that all Golden State Warriors are welcome to attend or not attend as they so choose, not addressing Steph Curry at all, and allowing him to make his own choice based on his own beliefs and morals. End of discussion.  But Trump has to act like a third grader here. Says a whole lot about the supposedly grown man in the White House.
"
1,"I watched China president Xi full speech at Davos. It was all intelligence, rational, but humble. He talked of how  China made its decision to join the WTO way back - it took courage and belief to walk the country into the unknown of global trade. He said while globalized trade is not perfect and full of challenges, it is like the ocean which no one can avoid. You learn to swim and sail in the ocean, or you drown.  Xi put forth China position on global trade. He said the same thing in the last G20 Summit. Nothing more and nothing new. This editorial does not begin to paint an accurate picture.  Compare a Xi and a Trump, the talk, message and the antics, make me laugh. The U.S. is in decline not because of any foreign country, but because of itself.

First, you attribute thoughts to Senator Hirono based on suspicion alone. Then you talk about conflicting cultural values and spiritual anchors without mentioning what they are. Whatever these imagined conflicts he has are, he must have been able to put them aside well in view of the fact that he has worked successfully with businesspeople from Japan for years. If his use of the language is """"clothed in American arrogance"""", do you think he would have had that success?

Just like the stuff that has been coming out of Trump's mouth for the past year - it is just more negativity and personal insults, with not one iota of substance in regards to public policy or a positive vision for this country.  Too bad the Republican primary voters didn't vote for Kasich, Bush, or several other Republican candidates when they had the chance. At least they had some sense of competency and personal decency about them. I could at least respect them and hope for the best. But Trump? You'll get your nightmare alright.

0,"State election officials voiced doubt Saturday that adequate security measures can be adopted before 2018 elections to safeguard against the possibility of a foreign government interfering in U.S. elections. That’s according to attendees at a weekend gathering of the National Association of Secretaries of State, whose conference was held amid an uproar over a Trumped up faux White House commission supposedly 'investigating' Trump’s fraudulent 'allegations' of voter fraud and actual heightened concern about recent Russian attempts to interfere in U.S. elections.     The Department of Homeland Security said last fall that hackers believed to be Russian agents targeted voter registration systems in more than 20 states. And a leaked National Security Agency document from May said Russian military intelligence had attempted to hack into voter registration software used in eight states.  Simple answer: Paper Ballots

1,"""""Donald Trump’s characterization of Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists during his presidential campaign angered Heidi Sainz, whose family is from Mexico and who has close friends who are immigrants.""""  If this belief is the basis of Heidi Sainz's anger, then it could stand reexamination; I believe the record shows Trump's concern was the effects of ILLEGAL immigration.  If Ms. Sainz makes no distinction between what's legal and illegal, well, that says a lot too.

A lot of our jobs rely on access to the American market. And so no, it is not brave, it is just silly, to poke a stick in the eye of a US president in a manner that will accomplish nothing good.  Put the shoe on the other foot. Suppose that five years ago some international fugitives sold, on the black market, all of Canada's top-secret infrastructure and engineering documents in the way of satellite technology and nuclear reactors and the Canadarm and on military defenses, giving Canada a really bad and compromising black eye. Would it be a wise move for the USA to welcome those fugitives with open arms, and their enablers, to live happily ever after in Seattle? Of course not. It would be diplomatic stupidity. It has nothing to do with courage or bravery.

It's insulting, crude and dangerous to let a bully win.  If Trump wins, I assume the foundations of democracy will keep him in line.   But much like Hoover, a true rock star entrepreneur when elected, he can't see past his own 'drive' or personal bias's to see that other Americans don't share his values.  This exact argument is often use to push back on liberals who are convinced that they alone have the proper outlook on life!

It is hard to imagine how this did not embolden Russian intelligence and reinforce Putin’s belief that he had backed the right horse. On October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence blew the whistle on Moscow, issuing a statement that the DNC hack and related cyberattacks had been authorized by “Russia’s senior-most officials.”   Yet Trump remained on the side of the enemy.

In fact that could still be the case any time in the future.  Vindication and redemption are two very powerful narratives in politics. By rhetorically over-reacting to everything Trump does, and by denigrating him personally, Trump's enemies set the stage for his eventual triumph.  Next up? They're going to find no evidence that Trump colluded with the Russians in the last election, and that the so-called Russian influence in that election was minimal. Don't say I didn't warn you.

He was roughed-up, charged with a felony, and dumped on the Canadian side without his car or his jacket, in winter, in the middle of the night. All because he didn't obey their instructions fast enough. He was subsequently fined about US$1600, and lectured by a judge on the importance of obeying US law-enforcement. It was all completely trumped up. In fact, the local US Attorney's office refused to press charges, and Customs had to go to the local police instead.  So you don't need to be entering the US, be brown, or be an immigrant, to land in a heap of trouble with US Customs. You just need to be unlucky.

Proving yet again that religion is merely a cloak that people put on when it suits them, not something they let intrude upon their real material lives; anyway, to their uncritical minds, when they ask for divine forgiveness they always get it. If there is a God, Trump will surely take a lot of forgiving (his confession should cost any Supreme Being a month of time at least). This President is beyond parody. Unless of course he was placed upon this Earth to give us our nuclear Armageddon... yes, that must be it... it all makes sense now.

0,"As a disaffected moderate conservative voter in a deep red state, I'll be looking for the Democrats to run candidates that genuinely have cross-party appeal & can peel off moderate suburban voters like myself in Trump country. Thus far, I'm skeptical they will take this opportunity. In the VA Dem primary, Tom Periello - everyone's favorite Catholic progressive pol - cynically disavowed his previous support for the Hyde Amendment & for the Stupak Amendment to prove his progressive bona fides. And in the Alabama senate race, the Democrat running may as well be reading the NARAL talking points he is so far to the left on abortion. In the end, he may win because it appears his opponent is a sexual predator, but the Democrats should wake up to the reality of the opportunity they have before them. Because running the equivalent of Barbara Boxer in each race is a fools' errand if you want to re-take Congress.

Many of the """"many more illegals"""" have included sending a parent back to their country of origin and leaving a legal family here without being provided for.  I fail to find your glee in this as it is once more an unbalanced reaction to a more desperate situation. 3.  I agree that some elimination of the mountain of the requirements placed on businesses is a needed relief.  The problem is that it has been done in a blanket manner without any careful review, and so it is putting many people and things at great risk.  But who cares about people, huh?  Not you!

Also, Boeing and the US government might have been able to strongarm Canada and Bombardier into submission, although Trudeau wasn't going down without a fight, but defeating AirBus ain't going to happen as it has a similarly powerful market to the US behind it. Boeing already lost the supersize aircraft market to AirBus and it looks like it isn't going to be able to prevent AirBus taking the domestic 100 seat jet market too. Boeing has to pull its socks up and not rely entirely on bully tactics.

Next, masking Americans in intelligence sweeps is designed to protect incidental Americans turning up in the sweep.  It's rare that politicians ask that Americans be unmasked; even more incredible that it would be Trump transition people who were unmasked; and politically damaging that such unmasked information be released to the broader intelligence community.  This is exactly where the intelligence leaks came from: Obama and Rice initiating an intelligence information dump on Trump associates which under the political circumstances would naturally turn into a smear campaign against Trump's people - right in the very middle of transition.

They are merely pro fetus. They can all justify killing folks once they can breath on their own. Their support of the death penalty and the killing of unarmed people by the police show they are not pro life. Heck, there have been hundreds of folks on death row that were innocent.

They recounted Hispanic co-workers mocking them.  “They’ll tell you straight to your face, ‘This is our country now — no more gringos!’” said Nick Conrad, a sheet metal worker who wore a “Hillary Clinton for Prison” T-shirt and wraparound sunglasses. “They’re not in it for our culture. They’re not here to assimilate.”  Mr. Conrad shrugged.  “He says what everyone thinks,” Mr. Conrad said of Mr. Trump. “He says what we’re all thinking. He’s bringing people together.

I've asked a few of them since and they all said they wanted to assure that Hillary would have an easy win.  But I think Trump may surprise them. I think the mood of this country's voters are such that they will reject an establishment insider Wall Street syphocant like Hillary. People want change and not the change that results in the middle class footing the bill for the indolent and the elite. People may still vote for Trump, but they don't need to. There's a third choice -- reject the two major parties that keep giving us idiots to run the country. I don't love Gary Johnson. The Libertarians could have chosen better. But he will do less harm to the country than either of the two idiots we know so well. And the change libertarianism would bring would perhaps save the country from economic and socio-political ruin.

I think America *has* subsidized the world (less so, in recent years) look at the U.S. Marshall Plan that paid billions to reconstruct Europe after WWII for example, and America carried the largest share of the western Cold War burden.  Yet, other countries contributed too! Look at the Soviet contribution; They kept the Nazis busy until the other Allied Powers could ramp-up to tackle Nazi Germany -- the Soviets lost 40+ million people to put us in position to win.  The Brits kept the Nazis engaged until the U.S. finally joined WWII.  The Saudis sold their oil at production cost for 41 years as part of their Cold War commitment.

America, Canada, and the rest of the world are in this situation because first Mulroney (conservative) and then Harper (conservative) told us that we 'had to have a deal'. So, it turns out that the deal absolutely gutted our economy and left an entire generation with very few options.  I do not support Bill Morneau's idea of running 35 years of deficits and accumulating another 1.5 Trillion in debt, HOWEVER, that does not mean that I intend to let the cons elect another ranting, raving, fiscal lunatic business failure to run the country either.  Let's just wait and see, shall we. I have already figured out how Trump will fund his spending plans without increasing their deficit, and I believe Canada stands to benefit from his actions.

Their worldview is based upon a belief in the superiority of their race and they explicitly want to remake the USA into a white ethno-state.  Although espousing these despicable views is indeed protected speech, that doesn't mean any decent human being shouldn't reject them and their hateful ideology in no uncertain terms.  Trump legitimized them explicitly by stating repeatedly that the Nazi and antifa protesters are morally equivalent.  They are not.  Of course he is correct that violence in our civil discourse (from any side) is both illegal and repugnant.  But when you see Nazi flags paraded through our streets, it's time to call them what they are, evil.

Most reasonable people would agree, I think, that the wars in Iraq and Libya, for example, were indeed disastrous. Not getting involved in such disastrous conflicts in the future would be a positive development. Better relations and cooperation with Russia would also be good for the world.

If any of the anointed """"aristocracy"""" is threatened - both sides close ranks & protect or ignore illegalities, no matter whether a Rep. or a Dem. is accused. Remember the Anchorage LIO mega million dollar debacle perpetrated primarily by Hawker & Chennault - not even investigated.  Far more costly & significant crimes take place routinely in Wash.D.C. If, by Grace of God, Trump is elected, he will upset the established apple carts of both major parties, after which we can look forward to a return to Constitutional government.

0,"Interesting & congrats to Macron.  It should be highlighted that many tensions in France (and some other European countries) is exactly because they DO NOT integrate their immigrants but have preferred to sideline and treat them as second class.  Mere temporary workers who are expected to return to their """"home"""" countries in due time.  As opposed to Canada's multicultural policy which has been studied as a successful model for working toward a harmonious state composed of diverse peoples, all of whom call Canada home.  Politicians like Le Pen (& Trump) are ideologically tied with people like Canadian PM Harper & his not so subtle attempt to promote an """"Old Stock"""" category of Canadian & a hierarchical system to supplant multiculturalism.  That road leads to massive social unrest.

You can't negotiate with bullies and/or terrorists. It's going to be a rough 4 years for Canada, so we'd better make the best of it and focus on damage control.

When Obama got elected, twice, the Big Tent got opened to every knuckle-dragging racist idiot who could cast a vote, and it won back both houses of congress.

Thanks for spinning the negative.  Just like Trump's maternity plan. The news stories are talking about how sexist and poor of a plan it is because it excludes fathers. Well, it is more important for the women to have the time off because their bodies need to recover. The 6 weeks is a hell of alot better than what they currently get (nothing)!

0,"Linda, your point is a good one.  I must admit that I have doubts as to the extent to which I can believe what Trump says.

Foreign policy is actually my primary field of expertise and there we clearly disagree.  While Trump's words were often careless and frighten me, I found the record of Clinton and Obama to be woeful.  Clinton supported intervention in Iraq, and was hawkish in both Syria and Libya.  For me the worst option is someone willing to intervene when tensions are high but lacks the commitment to stay and fix the problems when public support wanes.  Thus my fear with HRC, was exactly what we had with WJC, a hawish and violent policy, but no long term commitment to states after intervention.  Will Trump be better?  Here I have serious doubts.  But simply reimposing the Mexico City Doctrine will help much.

Whether you agree with Milo or not, he has a legitimate right, under the First Amendment, to freedom of speech.  Yet, these protestors shut his speech down.

Is it a good thing for the controlled to become the controller (to some extent)? The latter would certainly happen. Some key positions in a new """"non-profit"""" entity would undoubtedly come from the airline industry.

Well, we've had our comeuppance.  But we were, in fact, right, Goldberg: Trump is not just  deficient but ludicrously in every quality that might make a good president.

California itself, depending on your choice of formula ranks as 6th, 7th or 8th as a nation in the world economy....and the folks at this conference representing all levels of govt and the private sector, were discussing and implementing much change that was not federally financed....but indeed was a mix of state, local and private finance....and not only that it was working...

0,"Flo Janzen: I don't know if voters who are drifting to the right are left-leaning in every other aspect. I suspect that for the most part they're probably social and economic moderates. This illustrates the problem faced by voters in most Western countries, where the established mainstream parties have in many instances ignored public discontent about issues like immigration and globalization. The parties and politicians that have picked up on this discontent are essentially fringe in most other aspects, a fact that seemingly permits writers like Sanders to cavalierly dismiss those who support them as low-knowledge voters and even bigots. Even Trump likely would have been cast pretty much as a fringe candidate had he not opportunistically capitalized on public concerns about immigration and globalization, although I suspect his ulterior motive is to enrich the already privileged.

I've seen (and experienced, actually) videos of law enforcement overreacting and taking things too far.  So, I assume all law enforcement is capable of taking things too far, and am very, very submissive and respectful around all law enforcement.  I've seen videos of Trump supporters loudly stating and acting out very racist things, and also seen the videos of Trump himself embracing, supporting and acting as a protecter and enabler of the stating and acting out of very racists things.

It is also what non-ideological, pragmatic POTUSes like Trump do (which explains his strong cabinet of independent secretaries who can't be coerced into being Yes Men and Women reading shallow scripts prepared by the American equivalent to the PMO.)  So position papers are drafted examining the various options, in this case in regard to NAFTA.

What is incredible and laughable is the spin by the usual suspects here that The Clown Prince seriously influenced Trump to change course.

1,"I make no claims as to intention. When Trump put his hands on his daughter's gluteus, his eyes cast downward towards her bosom, he was likely engaged in saintly contemplation of the Holy Scriptures--perhaps Song of Solomon 7:6-9. A great many Christians--just not Right-wing Christians--voted for Hillary Clinton *because* they support abortion rights and believed her to be the best candidate for the Presidency and is why Hillary Clinton won the popular vote--more Americans thought she was the best choice and didn't buy into any of the nonsense that she compromised national security. Now we see that for Republicans national security issues really have more to do with partisanship as they now embrace foreign actors having a role in our national politics. Their embrace of Putin--a dictator, is revealing and contributes to the perception that Republicans do not support the idea democracy, something their record on restricting voting rights supports.

Obviously those who are fore the passage of Trump care are those who have health care insurance and most particularly those who have had there premiums raised or those who are fined for lack of coverage. The million dollar question is, will your insurance go down with the passage of Trump care? Are you one of those who's healthcare doubled with Obamacare. We have one choice to lower the cost of health care and at the same time bring the obscene doctors bills hospital bills and prescription drug industry under control. It's called single payer. Single payer lowers the cost of health care for everyone except those who are never going to get sick and are currently refusing coverage. With single payer your bill will go down to less it was before Obamacare. Good health is a prerequisite for being able to work. Everyone needs healthcare!

Can you please direct me to any public condemnation you made in 2012 or 2013 or even 2014 until now that rebukes Obama, Inslee, or any other politician for making it legal to repeat the camps?

ISIS has already used his statements to help recruit new suicide bombers, and you can bet Trump’s policies will help inspire attacks against Americans both at home and abroad. “His policies literally put our troops’ lives at risk—I’ve heard this loud and clear when I have visited them overseas. They also prove he has zero understanding of our country’s values and no intention of defending our Constitution. “We are a nation of immigrants, and America is stronger when we welcome the refugees of our enemies.

Having the US and Mexico led by opposing demagogues isn't a context for which Canada should wish during the concluding stages of these negotiations.

His misogynistic talk has been written off as blunt talk and killing political correctness. Since when is being polite politically correct? Donald Trump has an unshakable support of 35 - 40% of the adult population. Trump knows it. And so do congressional Republicans. Those Republicans therefore only offer mild """"Tsks, tsks"""" of Trump's behavior, because they think they need him to sign their bills. And if, for whatever reason, Trump does not finish his first term, Pence is waiting in the wings.

Trump lies from ignorance and its directly to the public.  He's clearly worried about the truth held in his tax returns, lied already about a foreign head of state.  He's lied to small investors, he's lied to two wives so far.   His character is clear, he has no qualms about lying for his own self interest  The only reason he hasn't lied about decisions in government policy is that he has no record.  To portray him as a truth teller denies reality.   I won't vote for him because what little he's said in policy is mostly the opposite of what I want for my nation and world

Who knows, ocean acidification may have wiped out the salmon.  Global warming may have radically changed our shore line.  A new energy source may have made oil obsolete as whale oil lighting. 50 or 100 years from now, Pebble in the ground, could be the only permanent fund that our great grand kids ever see.    Eventually, Pebble will be developed.  It is inevitable.  With Trump in office it could be sooner rather than later.  But, it will be developed. The only way to really stop it is to buy them off while it is still cheap.  This option sure beats having a foreign multi-national rip the guts out of Alaska for 3 cents on the dollar.

I remember Obama being called out for looking like he was bowing to a sheik. I remember Obama's term being met with McConnel saying it would not do anything Obama wanted.  You were okay with that behavior but not an investigation into wrong doing just because your guy won? Is that really what you are selling?  Explain how the democrats want to nullify the voice of the people?  Reminder: Trump lost the popular vote, you know the voice of the people, by 3 million.  P.S.

Those Canadians may not be active on comment boards, and yet, I suspect they are many, and mighty.

If Trump is to overcome these Satanic forces and bring the Republican Taliban’s vision to fruition, he must act quickly.  First, he must acknowledge that God intervened in the election and is responsible for his miraculous and unexpected victory.  Second, Trump should honor God and thank Him for Trump’s great political victory by making a human burnt offering sacrifice of his eldest daughter just like the human sacrifice Jephthah made of his only daughter in Judges 11:30-39.  Once these steps are taken, it’ll be smooth sailing for the Trumpmeister.  Just one caveat: remember God prefers all human burnt offering sacrifices, like his fried chicken, extra crispy.

He is said to have pursuaded Trump to increase our admission of refugees from 800 to 1,500 to cut into the deficit of tens of thousands as just reported. Kushner was a supporter of Trump's itinerary instead of Steve Bannon (according to far right websites). According far right websites Kushner was also responsible for the missile attack in Syria which was opposed by Bannon. Kushner is part of a group that includes Sec. State Tillerson, Sec.

A man elected by preying on the collective liberal guilt of the country.  An emotion which we as a nation really have no need to assume.  Then they expected to finish the job with Hillary Clinton as President.  The election of Donald Trump stopped that.  Now they have decided it's an all out assault on the government by any means necessary including violence.  They have also assumed the approach used by the left for decades.

0,"I don't think the scenario I laid out has any chance in the real world. The only reason it's even remotely plausible is this: Donald Trump doesn't know anything about healthcare; he doesn't care about it; he has nothing invested in it. What he does care about is """"winning"""" -- which is not about ideology but about humiliating his opponents. Republicans have no respect for him. He's a useful idiot; they pander to him in the hope that he'll sign what they give him. If he's not useful to them, he's just an idiot and they'll bail on them. It would be easy for Trump to flip on the Republicans and, on healthcare at least, become a useful idiot for the Democrats and progressives. His motive would be simple: to screw those he believes screwed him. Bernie Sanders keeps reminding Americans that universal healthcare is the norm in the rest of the developed world; that we Americans are outliers on this issue.

It's become increasingly dangerous to the future of our country to have someone who has absolutely no knowledge of foreign relations, the economy of our country, the ability to think, speak, or act rationally making decisions that affect the welfare of our country and our citizens. There needs to be action immediately to remove him from the White House, whether it's speeding up the Russia investigation, removal from office based on the 25th Amendment, convicting him of obstruction of justice, or forcing this man to have a mental evaluation to determine if he's mentally fit to run our country.

Welcome to how America will be managed for the next four years.

0,"American chicanery over softwood lumber predates Trump by decades.  The inefficient US lumber industry gets the Commerce Department to bring charges of subsidization.  The case goes before an impartial tribunal and the Americans get told, """"You have no case.""""  So the industry gets its tame weasels in Congress to weave around the law and Canada ends up paying its US competitors in order to continue having access to the market, where we supply 30 per cent of US lumber consumption -- and the highest quality portion of the market because our northern fibre is better than their easily warped yellow pine.  The answer:  stop shipping lumber south.  Let the federal and provincial governments provide no-interest loans to Canadian companies during the moratorium.  When the US construction industry finds it's paying through the nose for an inferior product, they'll mobilize their Congressional weasels.  Then the fight will be on, and US lumber will lose.  Once and for all.

Also, expect the US to demand that it be allowed liberal 'buy America' enabling latitude that would make a mockery of the free trade, level playing field, pretentions of NAFTA.  Canada, of course, will raise its own issues and bargain hard but this will be a hard, uphill battle.

The last thing Assad needs is gas attack. The rebels are desperate. They do need gas attack. The hope is to draw Trump in. It worked.  The last time the rebels, which include ISIS elements, were in retreat under Assad assault, the Pentagon bombed Assad without order from Obama. This time Trump is on Pentagon's side.

It is a real treat watching this wrecking ball in action. He is a product of our dysfunctional society and political system. So many people fail to see that AND are not MOTIVATED to do something about.  People are constantly underestimating him. I believe that's why the Republicans are scared of what he can do to their political support if he rallies his red hat flag waving deplorables into action.  What is a total utter failure are the democrats who have majority voted for his cabinet picks so far. It looks like they just rolled over breasts up.

Instead he lacks the self-discipline and temperment to not answer the questions about it and then gets himself into more trouble, embarrasses his cabinet members and chief of staff, and loses his agenda of talking about infrastructure. While all the birther movement stuff about Obama went on led by Trump, Obama only publicly commented on it twice. Once was a news conference where he produced a copy of his birth certificate to dismiss the silly rumour and the second was the White House Correspondent's dinner where Trump was present where he demonstrated Trump's silliness in front of him.  He had the temperament and self-discipline to not respond all the time to silly issues. Trump could solve most of his so called media issues by not tweeting and stop criticizing people

That is talk of violence?  Can anyone name any others?  Can anyone name anything that compares to Kathy Griffin's decapitated head, the continuous calls for Trump's impeachment or assassination, the play portraying his murder, or so many other similar actions?

You need to take a step back and take a deep breath and realize that you have been duped. Trump is a con-man and you are just along for the ride at this point.

0,"It all depends, of course, on what you are looking for.  If you take the arguable position that US cabinet members are not politicians and figureheads as they too often are here but are actually be expected to lead and manage huge departments with thousands of people and billions of bucks and so should be individuals with exceptional track records of executive experience and achievements then Trump's cabinet may well be the best one in history.  On the other hand, if you are looking for political hacks with the right identity politics profiles and the blind obsequiousness to the POTUS that comes with having the best job they ever had and needing to position themselves for post cabinet careers, Obama's cabinet has it all over Trump's.

0,"President Trump’s visit to Brussels/Europe wasn’t just another grab bag of impulsive aggression and gaffes.  It wasn’t scattershot.   It was quite clearly focused on destabilizing and perhaps eviscerating the NATO Alliance and somewhat secondarily, but relatedly, the European Union.   This has been the strategic goal of Russia and before it the Soviet Union for decades.   The sum total of everything that happened on this trip casts the entire Trump/Russia story in a decidedly more ominous light.   And the light was already quite ominous.

These are the things he will  tackle in relation to China and which have nothing to do with the One China policy.  As well, he will collaborate with Japan, Viet Nam, Singapore and other countries in the region to reign in China`s expansionist policies there while negotiating new bilateral trade deals more beneficial to the US with these countries.

0,"To grasp the full horror of this from a financial and economic perspective you have to look closely at Trump's Gettysburg address. Where, unlike Lincoln, he threatened the women accused him sexual abuse On taxes he wants to reduce the top rate to 15 percent, capital gains taxes to 15 percent and overseas earning to 10 percent. Big giveaway to the wealthy. But we have actually been down that road before. Remember Bush lol tax cuts? Even before the recession all they created was unusually slow growth. On his trillion dollar infrastructure plan. He wants to do it through """"public private partnerships, with tax incentives"""". And it's """"revenue neutral."""" Confused? That's a pretty good description of every Trump position. But in this case you need to understand that  """"tax incentives"""" are always checks written by the government when someone does something that qualifies. Build a bridge get a check. and elsewhere he cuts marginal tax rates to 0. It is one giant scam. One He will make big $s on.

Trump - Everybody, Hillary - Libya - Honduras , Obama the dronester in chief.  America is considered the worlds greatest bully, kids see what society accepts and they mimic. I believe bulling is far less in countries that are peaceful and do not make war. By that note, bulling in US schools will continue for a long time ahead. As long as US's never ending wars.  The public takedown of bully Ryan Lochte is a start. And that happened partly because of his actions in a foreign country, Brazil. That leads me to wonder what the bulling stats are in Brazil? Far less than the US is my best guesstimate.

Only diehard Obama loyalists, or virulent Trump haters, would look back with praise at Obama's consistent record of abysmal failures in foreign policy (to name but a few): the attack on Libya resulting in another failed state; the premature withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq resulting in the rise of ISIS (a major contributor to terrorist attacks in the West); Russia's incursions into Ukraine; Syrian chemical attacks on its own citizens; the increased role of Russia in the mid-East and America's retreat; North Korea's continued development of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles;  China's aggressive expansion in the South China Sea; and appeasement with Iran - a leading sponsor of terror in the world.

People dislike the guise of refugees/ immigrants and the lovey dovey BS that goes along with it. I don't need a lesson on that and it was not even my point.

Frederick married his childhood sweetheart, Elisabeth, and planned to settle down. The Bavarian Palatinate authorities, however, would not let him. They claimed he had left Germany as an illegal emigrant, evading taxes and the compulsory two-year military service. Frederick pleaded that he and Elisabeth were “loyal Germans and stand behind the high Kaiser and the mighty German Reich”. It was all to no avail. The Trumps were evicted and resettled to New York. World War I was not a happy time for German-Americans. They were summarily labelled as “alien enemies” whose true allegiance lay with the Fatherland. The Alien Enemy Bureau was established in the early days of the war with a brief to identify and arrest disloyal foreigners. It was headed by J.

Although I voted in the Republican primary, I have planned to vote 3rd party in the general and, so far, nothing has changed my mind. Sarah Palin warned in 2009 that if the GOP didn't buy a clue to the conservative movement's desires in the coming years that the GOP would go the way of the Whig Party it replaced.

The source of many turn-key hate phrases are the CATO Institute and the Freedom Foundation.

Truth is, as you demonstrate, it doesn't matter much whether or not Donald Trump worked with Putin to get elected, not to his base.  Your efforts would be better spent on vigilance toward the integrity and enforcement of the provisions of the Constitution and the rule of law; it looks like some end runs are being made around both.

0,"Donald Trump is an outstanding businessman. Cold, merciless, but outstanding. His performance in Washington D.C.(NY city) so far has drawn bitterness toward him. This before he is even in charge of things. The big horror-drama is his claim that the CIA and FBI are full of """"it"""" and are politically motivated against him. Well, even before he formally becomes President, he will have started a bitter, angry and resentful clash with two of the most important government outfits Washington D.C.. He utters absolute contempt for the people serving """"him"""" and the rest of Americans. But he now faces more and more contempt himself because anger among """"government"""" employees will spread wider and wider - no matter what. And I'm not just talking about the CIA and FBI.

Then there is the obvious conflict of interest in allowing his daughter to be in the chain of command as she runs a corporation. No president in history has had such a big conflict of interest and Congress being Republican dominated now prevents checks and balances from taking place. The judicial arm is the only one left to fight for our constitutional rights. And it seems that even this part of our government is under attack by our president that is used to having his way. Trump's way of doing things is to sling mud and hope that something sticks. His bully tactics is the new way of handling things.

The issue is the management of business interests after being elected President and this took place in January 2017 when he passed control of this to his sons.  Many running for public off take a leave of absence, or time off, from their work during a campaign and hand the responsibility of their financial holdings to someone else upon successfully being elected.  As I recall, no one was expecting Trump to get elected.  Why make such an arrangement when an outcome was anyone's guess.  Remember, Trump entered the race from the private sector, and not as a standing politician seeking higher office.

You seem to have been distracted by my observations about Spicer and Conway. I had no pre-conceived notions about either of them; I hadn't heard of Conway until she went to work for Trump, and although I had heard of Spicer, I had little familiarity with him and no opinion about him. I was introduced to him, as was much of the world, when he went before the press corps -- and the world -- on the day after the Inauguration to lie about the size of the crowds on inauguration day. No wonder he was angry that day, and so many days since: lying is hard work if you have a conscience; and I think Spicer does.

Hilliary beat Trump in votes, take that as a consolation prize and move on, whining about the rules of the EC reeks of sore loser.  As for voter suppression, give me a break.  Voting is an honor and privilege and putting forth the effort is a reflection of that.  Words like hassle, long lines, lack of free time as excuses for someone's vote being suppressed is a joke.  Now, if you have to dodge bullets and gangs to vote then that is suppression.  I guess voters are suppressed in Chicago and LA.

0,"Sorry, the tax code is the tax code.  It is every citizen's obligation to follow the law.  Trump or you are smart if you do that correctly.  It doesn't really matter what the amount is, only that it is consistent with the law.  On a broader perspective, Trump's companies undoubtedly pay a tremendous amount into the government through various forms of taxes including the unavoidable payroll and SS/MC taxes not to mention the payroll paid into the local economy.  I suspect that Clinton does not pay a penny more in taxes than the law dictates.  So overall, they are in exactly the same boat yet Clinton manages to spoof so many into thinking she is on higher moral ground.

0,"They have a majority but not enough of a majority to simply impose their will, and in some ways that is bad and in some ways, good. Trump did fail at getting in and doing what Obama did with ACA, rallying his troops. As for SCOTUS I would say that the current conservatives are far less partisan motivated than the liberals. Imposing their will and running roughshod over the system does not work out for either party or the people. But I will agree that I have been dismayed by the zero sum game and the strawmen that have replaced pragmatism in governing. All ideology all the time. Tax reform is a good example of how Schumer and Dems have done nothing but obstruct any reasonable overture. Trump could offer the cure for cancer and he would be blocked by politicians who want nothing to do to change the status quo. You can't reasonably deny that.

He most certainly was not the """"man of peace"""" he bambozzled the country and the world into believing he was. None of these thing things he HAD to do, and no magic wand was necessary to keep from doing so.  Trump is the ugly face of American militaristic capitalism, Obama is the pretty face.

If you can't see this, I truly feel sorry for you.  Either way, I'm glad the case is rapidly building for Trump's departure, whether it's impeachment, prison time, the 25th Amendment, or Trump stepping down on his own so he's not embarrassed on the world stage by impeachment proceedings.

1,"This kind of thuggishness and bullying is reminiscent of the Bush years. This underlines the fact that this kind of crude jingoism is particular to the Republican Party, a group of thugs who are unfit to govern. However, this will only backfire. Trump's bullying can't work now, when the US is far weaker than it was under Bush and when Trump himself is seeking to disengage with the world. Even better, China is waiting in the wings, more than happy and ready to step up and take global leadership from the US. It's fascinating to watch the Trump people shoot themselves in the head. The 3 billion that the US contributes to the UN is chump change for the Chinese. I hope that China does take advantage of this opportunity.
"
0,"A couple of other facts you might note. The 1st is that the US was a primary lender to Germany, not the only one. The 2nd economic pillar of Germany was world trade, which also fell.  Not even Hoover's suspension of war debts could stem the depression, that engulfed most of the developed world.  So Germany was not alone, with radical elements emerging, we had them in the US.  However, the leap of faith you make, equating Hitler with Trump seems based more on opinion, then reality. Especially when you have to resort to labels. That sounds more like Saul Alinsky.

1,"The future of our country under Trump has been a major concern since Day One. The longer his reign of error goes on, however, the more I'm convinced that Trump is crazy like a fox. He was crazy enough to win the Republican nomination and he was crazy enough to win the general, however illegitimately with Russia's help.  I just finished reading an article by Jonathan Chait in NY Mag which expressed the opinion that while Trump may be losing on policy he's winning his race war. As Chait puts it, """"traditional measures do not capture the most profound changes he has wrought."""" Chait calls it """"ethonationalism."""" Steve Bannon is key to that. Chait continues, """"In both words and deeds, the White House has established the federal government as the defender of white power in America, projecting a blunt-force message of zero-sum dominance."""" As Russia is seen by some as a white bulwark against the invasion of dark Islam, Trump's Russian infatuation makes sense. It's a pity so few people see this.

He opened his mouth about the UN during his campaign (like the wall, and Obamacare, and NAFTA, etc.) and now he has to appease his base by roughing the UN body up.  He gets away with that here in the US.  One thing Trump's Presidency has made clear, and which I personally am proud of America for, is that even in the face of profound disagreement, we all substantially seem to still put law and order and country first - some would argue that we are TOO civilized.

Assuming that he meant to say """"only"""" rather than """"always,"""" this should make everyone who did talk to the Russians — Flynn, Manafort, Carter, and even Kushner — very nervous. The statement seems to be an implied threat to those others, warning them (even his son-in-law) that Trump is prepared to throw them under the bus.

AG Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is now a suspect in the muddy waters of the Trump-Russia connection because he lied during his confirmation hearing when he said he did not have contact with Russian agents. Sessions met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Russia's top spy recruiter. He may be on Putin's payroll. He could be a Russian spy.  We also need to look at Trump's tax returns since the 1990s to see if there's been any Russian money involved in Trump's 30-year global business experience and interests. Indeed his son has already admitted the Trump Organization gets a significant pile of money from Russia. The Russia-Putin-Trump deal is about tons of money. So is Session's lie.

(via Golf.com). “Two hundred and fifty rounds, that’s more than a guy who plays in the PGA Tour plays. He played more golf last year than Tiger Woods. We don’t have time for this. We have to work.” Obama golfed 333 times as president, according to Mark Knoller of CBS News, a noted scrutinizer of presidential schedules. Obama golfed at a rate of once for every 8.8 days he was in office. April 1st was the 72nd day of Trump’s presidency. The Palm Beach Post’s best estimate is that Trump has played golf 12 times through Saturday. Including his round with Rand Paul, that’s a rate of once every 5.9 days.  Golfer in Chief  hard at work.

0,"Trump's trip to Europe was a """"home run"""" for Putin. In a speech after Trump's departure, Angela Merkel, the leader of the free world, said, “The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I’ve experienced that in the last few days. We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands."""" But autocratic leaders like Duterte, Erdogan, el-Sisi, and King Salman know that Trump has their back at the same time that he has pointedly backed away from NATO's Article 5.

A number of careful suggestions: a) Spadaro qualified his use of the word bigot - he defined it; explained it, and provided evidence and reasons for why he deliberately chose to use that *word*  (you overgeneralize and then compound the error by using it to judge NCR staff) b) Spadaro is not American - you have to factor in his world, context, culture, and customs.  So, compare how Spadaro uses the words you reacted at to another Italian commentator - Sandro Magister.  Magister is anti-Francis; right wing extremist; and yet he chooses to use even more offensive words than Spadaro. So, yes, words may eventually not mean much.  Parallel universe - compare how Trump lies every day multiple times and how that impacts facts, actual factual news, etc.  In his world, all is Fake News controlled by him - it is all about him.

True, Bill is not running for election, but then nobody would know of Hillary without Bills accomplishments. The Clintons despise people in uniform. You may doubt me, question the veracity of the statement, but they consider the military a necessary evil, not a needed part of our society. Peons to do their bidding. Maybe I am being to harsh in my judgement, but I don't trust them to not get my children and friends into a predicament and then abandon them or ignore their request for support(Somalia being a great example).  Trump has no experience in this arena. He has not let us down yet because he has not been tested yet. He might be a god awful choice, but the devil we know has shown an ability to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Talking about the hero of the left here.  A conceited bombastic neophyte or a pathologically corrupt demagogue. Some choice.

0,"It is not fair to compare approval rating polls versus actual election results.  Approval rating polls do not screen for Likely Voters, and some even don't ask if you are a registered voter -- they just ask if you are over 18.  A better measure would be, what are the approval ratings now compared to the last polls taken before the previous election?  Then you would find very little difference between them in the swing states.  And since Trump won the election with actual numbers that eclipsed the poll numbers, we can conclude that very little has changed since Election Day.  The same people who like or hate Trump still like or hate him.

If a person, whether a politician or private individual is complying with the tax codes as they are written it is up to the IRS to determine if they are violating the law, not the press and certainly not you.

He should learn his rights and take advantage of them, the only crime committed was that he lied to the FBI. Clinton and the DNC hired an ex British spy and others to compile dirt on Trump. Opposition research is common and used by all candidates. The real question is was there any hacked info provided by the Russians and used by the Trump campaign? That answer is obvious and the only one that really matters.

NYT has published numerous stories which were wrong.  While the wrong story is headlines, the retraction is a small article on page 9. As reported by Harvard University, media published and reports 93% negative Trump news.  And nothing of the successes. Economy is up, jobs are up, unemployment is down, manufacturing is up. Consumer and manufacturing confidence is up. But the NYT publishes an editorial blaming Palin for the Gifford shooting, a story they had retracted previously, and a story which will cost them in a civil suit, because it is """"Fake news"""". Your article is typical liberal spin, publish what should be to look good, but do the opposite. Anonymous sources are used way too much, and is the cause of the retractions.  CNN gives a fake news story resulting in the firing of three """"journalists"""", then show a Examinar cover that never was.

It's an amazingly effective strategy for better or worse.... Now, I claim these Liberals and even many Muslims themselves, are in fact themselves the most virulently Islamophobic among us... Consider the possibility that the Liberal government is soooooo afraid of Islam in all its incarnations, that they enable these measures to protect themselves? The many Muslims I refer to are soooo afraid of Islam because adherents to that ideology are killing each other big-league. Muslims kill each other at a FRIGHTENING rate. Read:Shia VS. Sunni.

0,"There’s a tipping point in these all too common mass murders where the American people say enough is enough. They aren’t there yet, sadly. The driving force for gun rights is based on their convoluted understanding of the second amendment , financial considerations of gun manufacturers, and the honest fear that the only way to protect themeselves, is to be armed. Ironically the only person who could reverse this trend might have been Trump. Most, not all gun owners are his people. If Trump had personally witnessed gun violence then we may have seen some sanity. Nothing will change in America regarding gun violence. I’m not fear mongering, I’m telling the truth. A democratic nation should be able to fix this problem.

I know first hand how much waste there is in defense spending-- money for defense will go to huge defense contractors who do everything, including going into war zones and providing security-- everything in the military is privatized. There is duplication, missed deadlines, bad products, and lots of guys getting rich-- closest thing to these private contractors is working for the State. An example of one of the biggest contractors-- they screwed up the Board of Water Supply billing system, the State Obamacare exchange, and information systems for Maui County (they are a big Canadian company but do work for the Military all over the country-- Austin Texas, San Diego, Northern Virginia, Seattle). Military contracting lies in the deepest part of the swamp that is Washington DC.

That is not abnormal. Presidents who have been in some sense the focus of investigations like this have often, probably usually, hired outside lawyers beyond the White House Counsel. But apparently shepherding this process is Michael Cohen, the President’s longtime “personal lawyer” and Trump Organization fixture who has his own tangled relationship with various Russian and Ukrainian interests, Felix Sater and more.  Remember, he was actually the one who met with Sater and that Ukrainian member of parliament who had a ‘peace plan’ to deliver to Mike Flynn.

Because Trump greatest asset was the eight years of Obama's policies that so repelled states represented by 307 electors that he won against overwhelming odds. So it was with Rob Ford, who could only have been elected because he was preceded by seven years of David Miller. And as Mr. Heinbecker must know very well, Hitler would have had little prospect of success had it not been for the rise of a characteristically blind and brutal socialism which threatened to engulf Europe.

Being reasonable is idiotic when one is confronted with a disaster. Republicans made a huge mistake, much larger than Brexit. I wonder how you will feel in two years, when the economy refuses to emerge from its crater, when the divisions created by Trump become permanent, when we have the feel of the Soviet Union as it fell.  George W. Bush was every bit the horror for America that we predicted on election night. And now the Republican Party has piled this heap of narcissistic billionaire 1% crap all over the constitution. To think that he was a person who can change America, who can do anything but enrich his 1% buddies at the expense of the poor... that is pretty unrealistic. They do wish to end the country of minority rights, to blow up the world, to suppress civil and human rights, . Time will tell. Hugh Massengill, Eugene

0,"Putin is using some form of Telepathy or mind control. This was explained in the movie Telefon back in 1977 starring Charles Bronson. Trump not his real name which is Yuri Rostov was planted by the KGB back in the late 1940s. Certain coded words trigger all the Soviet plants.The phrase is a line from the Robert Frost poem """"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,"""" followed by the agent's real first name.) Their mission was to sabotage crucial parts of the civil and military infrastructure in the event of conflict. Only thing stopping Putin from world domination and slavery for mankind is the pot plant. Those that smoke weed can protect themselves against Putins Telepathy and mind control. That why it is crucial to have Justin and Obama leading the way for mankind. May God help us all...

Imagine if they treated Trump's bogus claims about illegal immigrants in the same way that they treated Hillary's bogus claims about Russia.  Imagine if they, without question, simply repeated Trump's assertion that millions of immigrants were voting for Clinton.  What if they didn't even bother to actually fact check that claim?

DNR DOG Commissioner Andy Mack and his team has opened Alaska up to smaller oil & gas companies so Alaska will see more interest on the North Slope!  If the Governor and the Legislature make things better for smaller oil and gas companies I predict that Alaska is about to boom!  The State lease sale on the North Slope should see an improvement but it could have been better if the state dropped its harsh terms under Parnell that ran smaller oil companies pout of Alaska.  I predict only 10% of  all tracts offered today  by the DNR DOG leaving 90% with no interest, that would improve if the state went back to the old Minimum bids at $1.00, lease rental at a $1.00 per year and 12.5% royalty on a 10 year lease!

The absurdity of the details, and the ridiculous amount of energy wasted in analyzing the same frame of reference presented by such an actor as Trump, only serve best as evidence to the dysfunctional playground that allow certain mentalities to be taken seriously.  Shannyn has provided a good analysis; it is unfortunate that the repeated  nonsense  should require it.  For contrast, the ever widening scope of anticipated acts of war have a shamefully diluted presence in debate of substance, and the incomprehensible cost is for the most part obscured in truncated rhetoric- all to the salivating delight of the industry that perpetuates it.  Strange, indeed, that some who claim """"pro life"""" prerogative in an intensely personal matter of conscience can claim moral duties to support murderous, sustained acts of violence upon entire populations.

The comparison between Ford and Trump is weak. Trump grew up in a privileged world and lived much of his life above others in Trump Tower. Rob Ford, although from a wealthy family, lived just blocks away from the towers of the inner suburbs. He continued to live in the area. He went to public school in the area. He socialized with kids from the towers (and continued to socialize with them). Ford spoke their language because, wealth aside, he was one of them. It is why he smoke some crack in a bungalow basement. It was not just an impression, he was the real deal.

He said to do what you love, because then it is not work.  He said to keep the momentum going. He told of someone who was successful, but turned to the good life instead, and later found he was not able to replicate his success.  Trump said to never give up. He gave an example of himself given no chance of winning the Presidency. Instead he campaigned in locations that Clinton decided to skip.

0,"I happen to agree with tougher immigration enforcement.  In fact, I frankly don't agree with the concept that illegal immigrants should be handled with """"restraint"""", or anything less than immediate detention and deportation wherever found, and whatever age.  BUT, that's not what our laws and Courts say.  Processes have been created and are being followed.  Even a change to accommodate my view, which is consistent with Trump's, is subject to a process (likely long and noisy) requiring change in our laws and rules, if not the Constitution.  The Constitution has provisions that squarely contradict my gut sensibilities about illegal immigration.  Have to respect the law, rules and Constitution.  Have to accept the process, which not only allows, but mandates that questions like the ones Chin has raised (successfully, I might add) be addressed in our system of justice.  HAVE TO respect not only the right, but the obligation to vet the rules of law.  Otherwise. . .

0,"The problem with the Iraq comparison is that the US was hell bent on attacking Iraq and was looking to manufacture a pretext. That's not the case here.  Perhaps more dangerously, the US strike shows the unpredictability of the Trump administration; a week ago, senior administration officials, and the President himself, were essentially saying that Assad wasn't their problem and that it was up to the Syrian people to work out what happens (yeah right!). Understandably, the Assad regime understood those comments to mean that they had a free hand to do what they would. That's why the gas attack happened.  I'm sure nobody was as surprised as Assad by the about face and, even though the attack was largely theatre, the Assad regime and the Russians must be wondering what's next. I expect the message from the attack is meant to communicate to the Assad regime that it is free to exterminate Syrians using conventional means but that it must refrain from using chemical weapons.

0,"Friendly advice for the protestors.  I do hope this whole act stops. Nobody (including Trump) says these players don't have the right to protest. But they're using a method that is highly disrespectful of the USA, it's citizens, and our military. I believe (most of) these players probably love America (though I'm truly not sure about Kaep - he might be an anti-American radical), and they're free to advance their agenda how they please (as we fans are free to spend our entertainment money how we please). But they're not making any allies by being divisive and acting like they hate America.

Even the best of us (well, at least people we expect better of) make ourselves look and sound like fools.  Even Obama.  Certainly Trump, endlessly.  Just re-read the bit from Roosevelt's """"letter to Mr. Hoover""""  (""""letter? what's that?""""  Well, it was usually a formal communication, first hand-written, then typed and then mailed by snail mail... Took days.  In any case, it was probably re-read and rewritten before it hit the stenographer's desk (""""Stenographer?""""  Oh, that was an assistant--usually female--who typed correspondence.)

0,"Not entirely. The pope met with the Little Sisters of the Poor in the US. Trump promised “If I am elected president. [t]he Little Sisters of the Poor will not have to face bullying from the government because of their religious beliefs.” In the final days of the campaign, Trump again sympathized with the Little Sisters of the Poor on EWTN. Trump won 60% of white Catholics, critical for his win in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. In the White House Rose Garden ceremony May 4, Trump decried the “attacks against the Little Sisters of the Poor” before signing his executive order on “religious freedom.” He invited the sisters present to stand beside him, and shook the hands of two of them.

The DNC continues """"The Resistance"""" to mobilize violence and to stop Free Speech. We saw the DNC playbook at Trump's Chicago rally in 2016, the Inauguration, in Berkeley, in Charlottesville, etc.  Yet the most effective methods to counter extreme messages like the KKK, etc. is to not attend their rallies. When they march in empty streets, to bellow taunts to no one, to rage against the air, and to lash out at nothing, it quickly eviscerates their """"juice"""".

0,"I think the issue is an interesting one. I find that, in Seattle, the issue is similar to many other issues in the area. It's an issue of identity.  A majority of restaurants with reputable wine programs target one of two very specific demographics, either the older, very wealthy or the younger, hipster-ish (most people are neither). To be fair, this can be said of the Seattle wine industry as a whole. The problem with this is that image tends to trump substance. Originality and service give way to image and """"playing it safe"""". Please note that it is not original to stock vaguely decent wine from obscure wine regions for the sake of image.  In recent years Seattle (and the local wine industry) has gained the pretension of the Bay Area, but we fall far short in the category of substance.Quality in wine and restaurant programs (retail not so much) certainly exist here, but perhaps some expect wine to boom here as everything else has.We however need to first pay our dues and not force it.

These commitments are fluid in practice, as no  one (Obama) has done much about the Russian annexation of Crimea, nor the military coup in Egypt replacing the democratically elected government.

So in a convoluted way she argues that more stringent screening if not a ban are unnecessary. Huh? We also know that all the countries on the list have been targets of US covert or overt action - directly through bombing (Libya, Syria), drone strikes (Sudan and Yemen) or sanctions (Iran). Because they have been US targets, that alone makes them enemies of the USA and therefore in need of careful screening. She also ignores the point that this is a temporary ban until improved screening measures are in place. Until then why take the risk? Trump isn't so much making the US safer he is just cleaning up the mess left behind by his predecessor - that indirectly will improve American security. Fact is Canada also screens applicants from these countries to the point that very few if any get in - we just don't publicise it.

The same is not true for the President of the United States.  What the President says involves the force of law.

0,"As western politics and government decayed - lost moral legitimacy and functional foundations - each sort of party (kinda liberal and kinda conservative) rotted at the same rate and in the same ways.  All that is left is their PR.  Note that Trump and Trudeau both spend their time in a narcissistic haze, signing bills / laws and making low-voice speeches on ostensibly serious matters.  Both have made such a PR issue of the whole political thing that they are easily drawn into PR squabbles with equally silly people in the general information media  -  in lieu of doing anything actually connected with their jobs.  This situation was slow and a long time coming.  It is fast making a dialectic antithesis - a world of push-back.  For decades in the future, """"McCarthyism,"""" as a buzz word will be replaced with """"Trumpism,"""" and its equivalent here and elsewhere.

He said, ‘Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.’” Subsequently, the President’s Senior Adviser, Stephen Miller, stated, “Fundamentally,[despite “technical” revisions meant to address the Ninth Circuit’s concerns in Washington,] you’re still going to have the same basic policy outcome [as the first].”  Judge Watson applied the laws of the United States in issuing his TRO against Trump's revised executive order.

He even wrote a book strongly criticizing him.  I think what Senator Flake is saying is what very much needs to be said to return the GOP to a viable conservative alternative. As it is now, and has been heading for a long time, I see the GOP as a Party deep in a pathology and controlled by unstable extremists (of course, I say that IMHO :-).  Still, I am quite serious. I'm old enough to remember when the Democratic party was going off the rails due to blind extremists (are their any other kind?) and needed self-correction. I now see the GOP in the same place and am alarmed that too few Republicans see it the same.  I disagree with this man on many policy issues. Yet, his conservative record is 93% and has voted with Trump 90% of the time. Yet, in today's GOP, 90% doesn't seem to be enough.

The operative came under scrutiny from officials at the FBI and the State Dept partly because of at least two trips he took to the U.S. during the presidential campaign.  The joint Russian-Ukrainian citizen who trained in the Russian army as a linguist, told investigators in Kiev and Washington that he met with Manafort during an April trip to the United States. And, after a late summer trip to the U.S., the agent suggested that he had played a role in gutting a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform that would have staked out a more adversarial stance towards Russia, according to a Kiev operative.

Cleaner coal is a possibility but even taking the entire tops off mountains to get at the coal is too expensive to compete with the vast surplus of natural gas. Market forces have made coal obsolete and I believe trump knew that when he lied to the people of Appalachia that he would bring back those jobs. Power plant owners have already made the switch to cleaner natural gas. The coal industry is a thing of the past. Clinton promised to create jobs for the unemployed miners with training programs that are the future. Trump lied and got the votes.

The Democratic Party used to have the support of the unions. But they are now busy working on identity politics and bedroom-related issues.

It is guided by the belief that political and social goals are best achieved by the direct actions of the masses.

In fact, when elected officials questioned him directly about what he was up to, he lied point blank.  But now look at him. And at those who should distrust him! Because he attacks what the left hates most, James Clapper is suddenly a golden beacon of democratic trustworthiness. He's nothing of the sort. He's a technocrat who thinks he knows better than you.  With Trump at least you know what he's doing. Under James Clapper's watch, the democratic rights of 330 million Americans were assaulted in secret.

To say nothing of China expropriating American owned assets in China - without it's Chinese operations GM is dead (again).  With the US economy returning to the GFC lows, Trump would be toast.

But suppose we take the other 49 states and DC and exclude California, Hillary Clinton got 65,844,954 - 8,753,788 = 57,091,166 votes and Donald Trump got 62,979,879 - 4,483,810 = 58,496,069 votes. So for the other 49 states and DC Donald Trump won that popular vote by 58,496,069 - 57,091,166 = +1,404,903 votes.   That is why we have had the electoral college in place for over 200 years so one or two heavily populated states alone cannot pick a president. Donald Trump won by a landslide 304 to 228 electoral votes.

Mueller no longer offers even a pretense of investigating election interference, but his supporters seem gleeful whenever Mueller alleges any form of wrongdoing -- so long as the miscreant has some tenuous relation to Donald Trump.

The first ban had a number of  issues--effected current visa holders, greencard holders and other legal residents; contained language about a fast track for religious minorities, i.e. christians that amounted to a religious test; had an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees versus 120 days like the other countries on the list;  and did not describe any security concerns or threats prompting the ban.  These have all been address in the new executive order, leaving the only real issue being the intent of the ban, i.e. that because of president Trump's statements during the campaign its really supposed to be a ban on muslims.  Of course there could be other issues that I am not seeing, we will have to see what the civil liberty organizations say once they have analyzed it.

0,"Not true at all.  If you support a candidate that mandates abortion or even speaks of it as it is the only solution for teens in crisis, that is a mortal sin.  If a candidate merely knows how to read and in fact understands Roe v. Wade and knows it is the law of the land, voting for that candidate is not a sin.  There is no abortion law to vote for - that is not how it became legal.  Calumny, however, is a mortal sin.  Go to confession as you are a multiple offender. As for racism, it depends on their political program.  The fact that Trump appointed Jeff Sessions who is dismantling civil rights protections as fast as possible is cause for anyone who supported that to go to confession. Using nuclear weapons brings in just war theory.  If one nuke strike saved Seoul from a barrage of North Korean missiles (a real threat) I am not sure I would argue with using them - but Trump is not smart enough to make that decision.

The irony of it all is simply amazing, but of course, none of these groups """"gets"""" or even does irony.  And again, where are the principled and democratic Republicans?  Extinct perhaps?

Clinton couldn't hold on to those Obama voters, but Sanders, Biden, or Warren would have.

He did us a favour really by getting out of the way. Had he stayed in he would have done nothing anyway, and would only have obstructed progress. And we would have had to listen to him blather on about the media and his domestic enemies, and taking cheap shots at polite colleagues and diplomats.

0,"EN, Here's my take on president Trump and healthcare:  He does not view it as a major presidential concern.  It is Congress' job to come-up with the best plan and as he has stated, he will sign whatever Congress puts before him.  What is happening in Congress concerning healthcare is exactly how the system is supposed to work, the People making their voices heard thru their elected representatives to get the best compromise plan possible.  It isn't pretty, it isn't fast, but it is the American way of governing.  Additionally, I would argue that the President not taking the lead on this issue is a good thing.  We have had a far too powerful executive branch since the Great Depression which was/is contrary to the American system of governing.

0,"What is also true is that Trump, in his constant spewing of hate and conspiracy talk, has alienated more and more of those who once supported him.  He has alienated many in the GOP who have withdrawn support of his campaign, and it is reasonable to assume that a good portion of them will vote for HRC once they are in the privacy of the voting booth.  Trump's scorched-earth campaign has gained him no new voters to replace those who have abandoned him.  And what is correspondingly true is that Hillary has gained a good portion of new supporters.  Those core voters for either candidate will, as you point out so well, will not budge from their chosen candidate.  But it is that way in every presidential election, is it not?

0,"Your relentless rants against the MSM may make you feel oh so good, but they have no relation to the facts. According to Editor and Publisher:  """"At least one-third of the top newspapers in this country (the U.S.) came out against President Bush taking us to war at that time. Many of the papers may have fumbled the WMD coverage, and only timidly raised questions about the need for war, but when push came to shove ... they wanted to wait longer to move against Saddam, or not move at all.""""   A third of the papers in U.S. backed the invasion, and the other third did not take a stance. As to your reference about the recent U.S. election: Almost all polls showed Hillary leading throughout the campaign. The MSM reported what those polls said. And, in the end, Hillary led Trump by 3,000,000 votes. I think the word """"fake,""""  could be more appropriately applied to your posts.

Obamacare is still the standard most Republicans want to shoot for and much of the Republican plan is straight out of Obamacare. But they had to make changes for 10-12 conservatives. They hope Senate fixes things. Obama and the Dems exaggerated what Obamacare would do and when problems started in the markets, they (and insurers) either did not see or tried to hide developing problems. Insurers are to blame, but they did not get subsidies they are entitled due litigation under a provision inserted by a Republican (Marco Rubio). The insurance companies are part of the market screwup in underpricing to get customers but worried about the subsidies they were not getting and which they thought might be stopped by Trump or Republicans. Dems failed to do anything to fix this. Now bill is too favorable to insurers and preexisting conditions and drug coverage are near gone.

His innovation is not lying, of course; that’s a tactic as old as politics. Rather, it is his instinctive sense that the truth has become immaterial, coupled with his own agnosticism on the issue -- thestar.com Call me old fashioned but truth matters in both politics and religion.
"
0,"Although what Mr. Trump says may not be what certain people want to hear, it is sometimes the bitter medicine many should take.  It is ironic he should assailed for pursuing his agenda when in fact, those attacking him are defending their own pro-liberal agenda by feigning offence.   The attackers are wholly and completely a product of Britain's immigration policy of the past 40 years.  Mr. Trump aims to prevent that in his own country.  That is what he was elected to do.

0,"One of the nonpartisan fact checking organization recently examined Trumps statements and reported on average Trump tells a whopper lie every 5 minutes. From my observation many of his """"misstatements"""" are through ignorance due to his unstudied unscripted style. He tends to just make it up as he goes, and he seems to spend little to no time preparing or studying policy or issues before he opens his mouth, not that his supporters seem to care.

I'm encouraged by a show of independence to work with Democrats, but neither party has been able to get significant immigration law passed.   The devil is in the details and it's not easy getting a political consensus.   People have to accept some compromise - which could be why Trump puts things in the extreme, room to move in negotiation.  I can promise you that some faction in congress will have the sole objective of making sure no reform happens.  The last thing they want to do is kill their bell cow.

"
0,"ALL politicians take credit for positive results even when their policies  had little or nothing to do with the positive results. Trump is already doing this, falsely claiming various large companies (the Big 3, Boeing etc) changed their minds about moving jobs to Mexico etc when in fact these decisions were made years prior to Trump becoming president.  Trump is going to reduce the US corp. tax rate to 20% from 35% & this will add trillions of $ to the massive 'official' $20+ Trillion US debt.  Of course the real US debt is now over $130 Trillion when the unfunded liabilities of US Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid are included into their debt. In winning the election Trump pulled off the biggest con and his con continues daily.

But without NAFTA the U.S. economy will contract, there will be trade wars, jobs will be less. This is not his concern. He will blame others when this happen.

I think the Southern Poverty Law Center, and its Hatewatch project, will play an increasingly important role as advocates for civil and political rights in the age of Trump -- who campaigned on promises to undermine the rights of immigrants, religious and racial minorities, and the GBLTQ communities.  I think those Catholics who were victims of priests and bishops who campaigned for Trump from their pulpits, bulletins or diocesan papers might want to consider diverting all or part of the money they typically give to the church to the SPLC instead.  It is important that those who choose to do so notify, in writing, the priest, bishop and nuncio of what they have decided to do and why.

0,"Several observations: first, recognise that Trump lost the popular vote by a significant margin -- he does not have the voter support he thinks he has, and he's creating more enemies by the hour.  Second, he can only continue with executive orders so long as Congress and the Senate support him; senators and congress members who perceive that they are in danger of electoral defeat will refuse to support him; this means intensive local pressure needs to be applied.  Third, Trump is inordinately thin-skinned, and hence vulnerable to mockery -- he reacts violently to even the slightest provocation.  Keeping him preoccupied as the perennial butt of mockery could very well drive him into a fatal tailspin.

Mexico is ran by cartels and cartles have power because they will use violence. They get most of their guns from America. Stop the cartels from running mexico and then people wouldn't flee all the time and they have a better economy. That's the real solution. Not building a wall. That's just moronic to think a wall would even work. Trump is ruining this country. I wonder if this is how some Germans felt when Adolph Hitler came into power.

Donald Trump objected because Congress """"had more important things to do"""" So he didn't specifically tweet, at this point, that he wanted the OCE to remain in place.  Trump's first 100 days start January 20th. We can tally up the major damage by May 1st. I would say this is an inauspicious beginning for the 115th Congress.  Also, Ann Robson is right.

0,"Well at least you include the current occupant of the White House. As for me, the few people who care have generally found me to be decent, honest and ethical. I was raised that way, and as a general contractor I made those virtues a goal, partly because, you know, what goes around comes around. A G.C. needs a good reputation. Trump probably demanded that in his G.C.'s, but there is plenty evidence in his business dealings and his multiple bankruptcies that he has never applied those standards to himself.  By the way, I have never gone bankrupt, and my FICO is excellent.

With both houses of congress in his pocket this president has failed over and over again to repeal and replace.  He’s also failed to get wall funding which was supposed to come from Mexico anyway.  Maybe it’’s because he gets so red in the face at any possible slight that he lashes out at his own party.  I think Mr. McCain takes great pleasure in sticking it to Mr. Trump.  Mr. Corker too.  He’s also alienated Mrs. Collins from Maine.  Trump jong orange isn’t smart enough to know who’s on his own team. He’s rushing at the wrong goal line.  He just scored a lay up at the wrong end - again.  That’s hard to do with such tiny little hands.  Would you please comment on the total number of EO issued by this president?  I didn’t think you would.

0,"The American voters elected Donald Trump as President, on the basis of his campaign promises, one of which was for tax reform.   So, Ryan doesn't have to """"sell"""" tax reform to the voters.  Or, to their representatives in Congress, who purport to carry out the wishes of the voters.   Trump's campaign promises are, largely, the same promises that have been made by the GOP  Establishment for the past eight years.  But, while the GOP has been great, with promises, their track record of carrying out their promises has been abysmal.  The GOP has the Presidency, and majorities in both Houses of Congress.  Ryan doesn't have to """"sell"""" anything.  He simply has to bring the promises to a vote.

If it were just the usual more liberal outlets that would support a simple bias.  With 95% running  negative it suggests more than simple bias.  It suggests that a majority smell serious trouble with the Trump administration carrying the stink of Abscam, Watergate, et al.  We have the Wall St. Jrnl. publisher on record stating that they would be fair in their coverage of Trump.  Yet, they are still reporting negatively on his efforts.  The author would see this as collusion with the liberal outlets.  However, at some point you come to the conclusion that sentient minds find Trump in the wrong.

Trump only received the support of 26% of eligible voters, Clinton received 31%. Forty-three percent of eligible voters didn't bother voting. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Trump won the electoral vote, which gives some Americans' vote almost 4 times more power than other Americans.

The US foreign policy is turning back to what it was before Obama - cynical manipulation through war, assassinating anyone it chooses, propping up dictators and seemingly about to openly support Sunni states against Shia.  That will mean war with the Russians as well.  Petty prejudices against Trudeau are so far beyond the danger facing us with Trump - unless you haven't ever heard of blowback.

0,"John500AF ---That is good. Notice, however, how Trump was assailed when he said that in Charlottesville that there were good people on both sides, but there was violence on all sides, and he was attacked for that.  Even some Republicans disagreed with him, although the VA State Police had said so.  What I see is that people are looking at things without adequate analysis, and therefore making wrong judgements.  Those lead to more serious problems and conflict and even, as with the Antifa, of people ignoring some worrisome trends, groups and actions. It is common for people to poopoo attacks on their side by deflection. Nevertheless, we must not become one sided, as many seem to be.  We have defective politicians, even with what merits they may have, so we have to live with that, but we must raise our voices to pursue rationality and civility.  They are not too popular at present.

Allende was a doctor trying to implement socialized medicine, much like Bernie. Harry, I recommend you take a political science class.  America is not pure capitalist and neither are the dictators in Russia and China.  North Korea is certainly not democratic socialist.  It runs like all the citizens are in the military. Bernie's 2016 campaign started a movement to reduce inequality.  Remember the !% slogan.  His opponent, a lapdog of Wall Street, sabotaged his campaign.  The """"emails"""" proved that.

If Trump fails the US does NOT fail as there are many who are capable of taking his place.

In 2020 there are plenty of capable people to take over for Trump & that includes Kasich & Romney on the Repub side & even Bernie Sanders would be a far better president than Trump.  The only problem with Sanders is he will fully restore Obama care when it really needs to be tweaked big time that will control costs but allow the sickest in the nation of legal citizens to get the health care they need.

Until the US is ready to put money and lives where Mr Trump's mouth is, and for a long period of time - say 20 years or more, it should stay clear of this mess and keep pressuring aspiring global player China to truly isolate North Korea and in the process show they can see a bigger picture.

Why should we and the Canadians have to go through all of that and the inspection when people from Mexico don't. He wants Mexico to take care of the drug problems that they are creating and the people in the US that we keep sending back after notifying the Mexican govt that they are expelled from the US so keep them there. Trump knows that America needs the legal Mexican workers and so does Mexico why should we put up with the debt and the problems Mexico should deal with.

The future became ominous for our country, and the ideal of liberty, when the power of democracy was seized by a handful of greedy people for their own benefit; when a state of perpetual warfare was equated with the health of the nation; when we began rubber stamping, with our votes, a process which took wealth, peace, and security from major swaths of the world so that we could have it here in our little neighborhoods, standing on the backs of 2/3rds of the world's (poor) people.

It's become a far-right ethno-identity politics party like those found in Europe, driven by a personality cult. This is as far from true conservatism as one can get. Conservatives can debate policies because they are driven by ideas. Far-right politics is devoid of policies because it is driven by reactionary impulses and contempt for ideas. Too often under Obama the tendency has been to make things up as they went along, but at least there was regard for basic rules of civility. For the next four years we won't even have that to guide us. It's going to be rough ride. Our only hope is for Americans left right and center to place American and constitutional values above their respective party preferences. Because party and leader first will be the only ethic under Trump. That's not conservatism.

There was also a time when I wouldn’t stop in any restaurant or bar on my way to Fairbanks when I had a good looking white woman with me. I’m brown. I had had too many “what the eff are you doing with my woman???” remarks from some illiterate ignorant white men.  They were entitled. Privileged if you will, to act that way.

0,"The tone of Trumps speech was mostly moderate with occasional lapses into exaggerated statistics and embarrassing sentimentality. His call for cooperation sounded hollow, especially when he described Obama's medicare as a disaster yet lauded his own """"wall"""" project. The low point of his speech was when he negated the US's role as a world leader. Environmental issues were totally ignore unless you consider coal mining and oil pipelines environmental issues. The disconnect between reality and Trump seems to grow wider. The man just doesn't """"get it"""".

Trump has already done a great job of alienating our allies.  Every time he opens his mouth his cabinet has to clean up the mess.

The reality may be that active resistance may not accomplish everything it seeks to do, but it will serve at least a couple of important purposes: to unify those who find Trump's presidency and his administration's goals abominable and untenable;  to erect as many legal and procedural roadblocks as possible, including the very real threat of upsetting the Republican apple cart in 2018.  These efforts won't protect us against the worst Trump can do in his peripatetic foreign policy decisions, including his use of military """"solutions,"""" but they may keep some of the Democratic programs at least on life support.

Billions and billions of costs facing him while he makes massive tax cuts asap - primarily to the business-world.

0,"This op ed nearly made me throw up.  The idea that some NFL players decided to take a knee during an anthem to draw attention to an issue is not an earth shattering event.  It became much larger when Trump decided to weigh in, by calling them SOBs and calling for their firing. Then came the predictable backlash from  players who had not participated in the protest but felt obliged to defend anyone's right to do so.  Fans, of course, have a perfect right to voice their displeasure with the player's choice of protest, and many did just that.  All of these things are so trivial in the big scheme of things that it boggles my mind to read (in a painfully long column) that someone's view of a sport he purportedly loved has changed forever.  Gag me with a spoon!  Football fans are football fans. A few knees taken in protest may illicit a round of boos but in no way will it send them away from cheering on the home team.  Adam Radwanski has lost credibility with this reader.

0,"My biggest concern about Trump is his extreme narssasism, his refusal to study up on issues and public policy, and his refusal to seek informed advise, seemingly thinking he knows it all already despite regularly stepping into it and advertising his ignorance. His advisors, who he never seems to talk to are mostly folks nobody has ever heard of and are quickly recycled. My theory is Trump does not want anyone around that looks smarter or better informed, which would be in line with a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Trump is all about the Trump, and really nobody needs to know anything else. They buy into that or they don't.

The margin is all from one state. California, a 100% sanctuary state with an estimated 7 to 8 million illegal immigrants; most who can get a California drivers license legally which is the required ID to register and vote.   Hillary Clinton  got  8,753,788 votes and Donald  Trump got 4,483,810 votes  in California which gave Clinton a margin of +4,269, 978  votes in California.   But for the rest of the country w/o California  Hillary Clinton got  65,844,954 -  8,753,788 = 57,091, 166 votes and  Donald Trump got  62,979,879 -  4,483,810  = 58,496, 069 votes.

Second, job creation under Obama's Dems was at the second highest rate since WW2 - behind only the last Democratic President, Bill Clinton.  Third, in case you weren't paying attention, the Trump voters were the very """"poor people"""" who abandoned the Dems this time around

0,"Since before Confederation, Canadians have struggled to balance two attractions.  The first was North American economic integration which appeared to offer the easier and quicker paths to prosperity but at a risk to our autonomy of action and independence; the second was greater domestic east-west political and economic integration coupled with increased trade and geopolitical engagement outside the US orbit which was more difficult and costly to achieve and maintain.  The Trump nationalist and mercantilist obsession brings this struggle into high relief.  Canada needs to pursue sound foreign engagement beyond the US in a calm, steady manner that reasonably avoids gratuitous confrontation with the US but maintains Canadian legitimate interests (including the aforesaid balance) and values.  This implies economic cooperation with the US where our interests and values are respected and our relations with other countries are not impared.

It's interesting that Democrats won't acknowledge their rejection which lead to losing the House, Senate, Presidency, a huge majority of Governors and State seats totaling  over 1000, culminating with the election of Trump.  Yet, their strategy seems to be  to a campaign against Trump. The irony is that they label Gorsuch """"dangerous"""", Trump """"dangerous"""", AG Sessions """"dangerous"""", but not the protesters that smash windows or BLM radicals who are ready at the drop of a pin to create violence. Open borders... not """"dangerous"""".  Trump has met with a ton of executives in order to spur the economy and create jobs.  I doubt we'll see Al Sharpton visiting the WH over a hundred times.  It will be interesting to see if the former President will join the bandwagon in criticizing his successor. I hope not. In fact, it would be a great opportunity to unite the country, which is sorely needed. We'll see.

I think the fact that we are having such a hard time getting there is yet another reminder (gun control and capital punishment are others) that the United States has a reactionary streak that runs through our history and politics; but I think we will get there. Trump has consistently described an approach to health care that can only be achieved by way of a single-payer plan, although there is no evidence that he understands that. He recently and correctly praised the Australian plan as much better than ours, apparently oblivious to the fact that theirs is a single-payer plan. He has lent his support to a hideous, evil plan because he doesn't know anything about health care and doesn't care about it. I think he has unwittingly advanced the march toward a single payer here.

0,"This is yet another occasion where Donald has attempted, operative term being attempted, to do a complete 180. However, as it was visibly seen, his response this morning was at once tepid, fallow, half-hearted, forced, and some would say disingenuous.  For over five years, he has not only been at the point of this movement, but also its most vocal and profound proponent. There are literally dozens and dozens of recorded events where he his questioned the veracity of Obama's birthplace. So much so, that he offered a five million bounty for someone to verify his belief--the five million, obviously was never tendered.  His pugilistic denial was not only a personal affront to the President, but an attempt to sharply rebukes its legitimacy. This is not just sad, as he is now wanting to assume that very same office-- as I have always said, tone, comportment, civility and carriage, count, and he (Trump) seems to be either oblivious or wanton in his desire to be a polemic caricature.

0,"Canada's main trading partner is the US, and cannot compete with the low costs of Mexico or China in international trade. Why bother to buy from Canada if you can get it cheaper in China? So, the US cannot be replaced as a trading partner as you're proposing. We're lucky to have the world's largest consumer right next door. That said, the threat is probably overblown. The Canada-US Free Trade Agreement predates NAFTA. Even if Trump completely abrogates NAFTA, the previous agreement still stands. Canada does not run a chronic massive trade surplus with the US, like Mexico. Cutting the trade deficit will be Trump's main objective. It is shaving several points directly off GDP. As long as Trump doesn't accept Paul Ryan's proposed BAT tax, Canada is probably still in a good position going forward. He is already on the record as being opposed as recently as a couple of days ago. Trudeau should work hard to ensure it stays that way.

0,"Monuments, once designated, can only be un-designated by Congress. FDR wanted to undo the Castle  Pinckney Monument in South Carolina in 1938, but was told by his Office of Legal Counsel that he had no authority to undo the monument, that only Congress could revoke the  monument designation(Which it eventually did, in 1956). Bush 43 was told the same thing after reviewing some of Clinton's midnight monuments upon taking office in 2001. So Bush left the monuments alone, and eventually added 6 monuments of his own. monument designations are a very special kind of executive order, the kind that are-unless Congress acts- permanent. Trump can undo a lot of Obama's moves. Monuments however, aren't one of them. Any monuments Obama creates in AK, regardless of number or size, will be upheld by the courts, due to Supreme Court precedent. Congress will gripe and grumble about it, but eventually will appropriate money for the monuments as part of the appropriations process.

In the recent election, Clinton would have more electoral votes than Trump and Johnson (Clinton 265, Trump 260, Johnson 11, McMullin 2) but no majority, so it could be the case that if a majority of states have majority Republican delegations in the House of Representatives, Trump could have been elected anyway.  https://www.quora.com/Would-Hillary-have-won-if-all-states-allotted-their-electorial-college-votes-proportional-to-the-popular-vote-in-that-state  https://www.quora.com/If-electoral-votes-were-apportioned-not-winner-take-all-based-on-a-states-popular-vote-would-the-outcome-of-any-election-since-1960-been-changed

0,"Trump tried playing nice to both Democrats and Republicans after the election up until last month. His hardball talk until then, if you will recall, was largely aimed at the fake media.  For his restraint and good will, he got run over--leaks, congressional stalling, a special prosecutor, a largely disloyal hold-over staff, public smearing from many of his fellow Republican and all manner of backstabbing. To say that Republicans have to suffer through Trump's abuse is preposterous.  It is the usual fake news, 180 degrees out of phase.  Trump now knows that he has to go on offense merely to survive, let alone win for the nation. Both parties and a very large segment of government personnel are, whether they fully understand it or not, working for the international elite establishment mafia, otherwise called the deep state, or simply, the establishment. The establishment sees America and its citizens as something to be controlled and limited; it does not have our best interest in mind.

0,"Yes, Comey has created a conflict of interest for Mueller. However, the real issue is Comey's relation to the President of the United States. 28 US Code Chapter 33 establishes the DOJ and FBI (FBI in Part II) as part of the Executive Branch. As we all (should) know, Article II of the Constitution gives ALL executive power is given to the President of the United States. Consequently, President Trump had every right to tell Comey to go light with General Flynn and he had every right to fire him for incompetence. The FBI is NOT independent! Comey worked for Trump.

We have been fractured for over a decade now - certainly since Bush tricked us into an illegal war. We were united for a short time after 9-11 and that was the way it should always be. The entire plan of the elite is to under-educate and divide Americans so that they can control us and keep the money pouring into their coffers. The cliche, """"United we stand, divided we fall"""" comes to mind. It is time to quit being so ridiculously partisan and start being Americans again - united Americans. Otherwise, America will not be the great country that it was for 200+ years again.

Like with Thatcher, his earnest allies will turn on him to save their own hides and he will be impeached.  But that's only the beginning of it. Trump is filling his cabinet with billionaires.

I'd challenge the idea that they are just looking for anti-Trump fodder. Americans are dealing with a shock on their governance that most of them had not expected. It seems to me that many of them must surely be looking for evidence, hints, and signs about where this is going, and the relationship and trading structures between the countries is a good place to look.  Though, no doubt, some Americans will be looking for President Trump to somehow put Canada in its place, I think a lot more would be looking for a sign that our enduring good relationship will continue. A lot of Americans would be dismayed if Canada turned our backs on them.

I've never been a fan of itemized deductions because they cater too far to particular interest groups for no real reason. My big concern with this plan so far, as with the Republicans' numerous attempts at Health Care, is they are trying to sell us something without the details sufficiently hammered out. Even Republicans admit all the numbers haven't been worked out. This is where the mess starts. This is where unintended loopholes or domino effects get created that can tank an economy. I want to see a tax plan thoroughly conceived, all possibilities pondered, all i's dotted and t's crossed, so we don't end up with another ACA or Trumpcare Bill that will need a reboot in 2 years. The big problem with Congress this year is they just want to pass something, anything, as fast as possible, regardless if it works or not.

But like so many simplistic sayings, it breaks down. There is a kind of false equivalency to equate Trump (or other billionaires) with the average American. From what we know, Trump took nearly a billion dollar loss and deducted it from his tax burden, in effect denying revenue for the government that other tax payers have to make up. Yet Trump maintains huge personal holdings including his own jet and a gilded NY residence. In contrast, those of us who take their legal deductions for such things as children and property tax most likely have a few toys, but most of our income goes toward paying for basic needs, like a modest home, a vehicle, clothing and feeding our family. A deeper irony is Mukavetz criticizing others for criticizing Trump since we don't """"plus up"""" our tax. Does Trump do that?

0,"That's the model that Trump has taken to the White House.  Trump uses concepts and language that evoke strong reactions of support and opposition.  Some people like him, and others hate him.

How about Bush 43 acting that way towards Gore or Kerry?  remember when Bill Clinton posted a picture of himself whacking a golf ball with Bush 41's face or Bob Dole's face on it?  Me neither.

0,"I love the faith and it is mine as much as Burke's. Whatever the form of the Resurrection, the witness to it by hundreds of the brotherhood is the witness of the Church. The questions you find so important are debateable and dissent comes from the Vatican arguing that authority trumps reason and evidence in matters having to do with human sexuality. The difference between Protestants and dissidents is the latter have a well developed gift of Fortitude. It is easier to defend authority than to challenge it, at least under an authoritarian Pope. One of those is safely been proclaimed a saint (buying off his supporters) and the other is retired. The current one is a source of hope who does not seem to have the word Magisterium in his vocabulary. Of course, on economics, I am no dissident. Benedict's Caritas in Veritate is still the norm for Catholic ecoomics, including its social democratic overtones.

That fact alone establishes the memo as a biased account of the meeting.  Add in the fact that he gave the memo to someone else to leak, AFTER he Was fired, hoping a special investigator would be named without leaving his fingerprints on the dirty deed and you can pretty much kiss any chance of it being considered evidence by an impartial person goodbye. You know what they say regarding stories, right?  There are 3 sides to every story.  Yours, mine, and the cold hard truth.

It provides that """"no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States] shall, without Consent of Congress, accept ... any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.""""  Trump's companies do deal with businesses that are controlled or influenced by foreign government officials. Legal experts say the potential for constitutional violations is high.  The Bank of China is a lender for one of Trump's buildings in Midtown Manhattan. If the Bank of China were to offer Trump's company a favorable interest rate on that loan after he takes office, it might raise an Emoluments Clause issue.  Rest assured Democrats will raise this issue.

When will genuine newspapers like NCR realize that they have a moral duty to shake us all till our collective teeth rattle, to ram us up against urgent reality? Pope Francis wrote a whole encyclical about it, for pity's sake! Climate change dwarfs every other news/legacy item by a factor of infinity, especially since 'the national whiplash from Obama to Trump' is apparently to be focused precisely on undoing this 'legacy', precisely at the most dangerous time ever for life on Earth.  If NCR editorial staff have such a gigantic blind spot, what hope can we have for the Trumps and Tillersons of this exquisite, and exquisitely fragile, planet?  Take positive action for a hopeful, sustainable and beautiful Earth in times of Trump.

As Putin has said many times; """"Presidents come and go and the American policies remain the same.""""  Alleged Russian government sources were behind the Trump dossier, or did that fabrication fall down the memory hole too. How did that help Trump?  All presidents since Bill Clinton have said they would like to improve relations with Russia. It never happens because the CFR says it will not happen. For foreign policy Presidents are script readers, nothing more. Read between the lines in Obama's transition letter to Trump.  Putin's choice was surrender to globalist corporate/banking interests, as Yeltsin did and which has no easy way out, or rebuild Russia for Russians. That is the sole reason for the relentless media campaigns against him. As for corruption, you overestimate it in Russia and underestimate it in the USA.

1,"Trump isn't a billionaire because he had """"what it takes to be successful"""" so don't make me laugh. He's a billionaire because he inherited his wealth from his father. Every businessperson does not play by the same rules because the super rich have a much greater ability to avoid paying their rightful share of taxes because they have paid lobbyists who """"pay"""" politicians to write tax laws in their favor. The average working person does not have such a favored ear with members of Congress who write tax laws. It doesn't matter if Trump saw a homeless man on the street and remarked in a particular year that the homeless man was worth more than he was since, as everyone knows and Trump knew at the time, he still had a great deal of wealth. The biggest problem with Americans is there are so many loathsome sycophants willing to do the dirty work of the super rich. Too bad taxation is the substitute for the guillotine, such bootlickers deserve to lose their heads.

0,"Dennism, one of the many things I dislike about our conservative fellow travellers, is the almost constant resort to attempting to discredit a person by referencing the language used, lowering the tone, offending their sensibilities, etc.. Its plain snobbery and is the first port of call to deflect from an indisputable point being made to them.  Interestingly enough, I was reading a report last night by scientists who have concluded that - people who swear are generally of a higher intellect than those who don't. (They give examples like the swearer has a better, broader vocabulary, understands nuance etc. much better, doesn't live under the verbal restrictions non-swearers do - like no sense of humour, for example.)  I'm going to keep that in mind every time one of them sets off on a tirade of indignant, moral omnipotence on here. It is amazing that they are so touchy about anyone 'lowering the tone' on here, yet completely ignored it in Trump.

0,"You know, Paul, your comments here are very partisan. That is your right, of course, but you shouldn't assume that everyone else you view as the opposition are equally partisan and therefore their motivation is purely political.  I've said this in other comments on this site, and I'll say it again to you. If there is an impeachable offense found, and Trump is removed from office, we get President Pence. For liberals, Pence is a figure far more hostile to their cause. He's more hardcore right wing, and more competent, so odds are he would get more right wing policy enacted.  I want the investigation to get to the bottom of what happened because I value national security and election integrity over my own political views. Country before party.  I'd encourage you to think about that before you decide to dismiss and mock those of us who are concerned about this issue.

Claims of rampant fraud are a lie.  It's Joe McCarthy waving blank pieces of paper with 'proof' of commies in government.  Funny, I'm concerned that Trump believes what he says, and at the same time, worried Clinton doesn't believe what she says.   lol  Oh well, my vote is submitted and that's the only thing I have any control over.

0,"Nightowl, that was excellent; however, the question was posed for the other guy (Dtjay), as he was the one who scoffed at the notion that Trump inherited a strong economy. He certainly didn't inherit a recession, as Obama had. Anyone with an IQ over 50 (it appears most have IQs below 50) knows that the economy is affected by far more than who is president. Q4 was higher, it seems, based on two things: 1) elimination of the uncertainty of who would be president 2) unfounded optimism that Trump actually knew something that no one else did. (I suppose it was also buoyed by folks investing in private prisons for all the illegals that are surely to be rounded up in droves.)

0,"Being President is like a prison as you are expected to take all the country's problems and perform miracles. Yet much of the power actually lies in Congress. Donald Trump has spent his entire life doing anything he wanted and enjoying himself. At age 70, I don't think he will enjoy spending 8 hours a day in meetings, reading reports and fighting with Congress.  Nobody knows what's going to happen and it's pretty fascinating.

If you recall, Trump met with the Mexican President and behaved very well, until he got BACK into the US and proceeded to pick up his border wall ranting right where he left off.  For now, Canada and Canadian trade are generally seen positively within the US which helps us, but don't doubt that Trump's attitude would turn on a dime if we were to do something to anger or embarrass him.  For now, follow the successful path of flattery and avoiding US domestic affairs.  Also, while I agree with other posters that we should increase our military spending somewhat, it has to be done methodically and with a clear plan for the future.  Simply throwing large wads of money at any government agency is a good way to get it flushed down the toilet.

I blame the deterioration of the education system in this country for clearly there are a lot of people sadly lacking in critical thinking skills. All one has to do is pay a modicum of attention to Trump's own words and actions to logically conclude that a large majority of what is being reported is factual.

It is still early. We haven't heard from General Flynn yet. If Mr Trump was trying to obstruct the investigation of Mr Flynn then I suspect he has something to say.  My guess. Is it is regarding Trump's Russian engagements. Perhaps shady Russian financing of hotels or Russian prostitutes during the Miss Universe pageant as some have suggested.

0,"The U.S. was once proponent, even champion, of free trade. Free trade meaning agreement for low or no tariff, severe restrictions on powers to impose it.  Trump is hell bent to reverse it. Impose stiff tariff. Cancel trade agreements. Why? Because the U.S. can't compete anymore. When it could compete for many decades after WW2 it signed all these agreements on trade including Most Favored Nation treatment. It joined the WTO. Now unable to compete it blames the world and want out. Heads it wins, tail you lose.  The world will proceed with various favored trade agreements, a better-managed globalization. Without the U.S. Watch out Mr. Greenback.  Why the U.S. can't compete anymore. 100% its own policies, own culture. The country is loaded with millions of the world best experts on good life, entertainment, how to extract welfare from the state. Far exceeding their productivity or ability to produce. The laws of economics apply even to America, without exception.

Clinton is a seriously flawed candidate, but she in no way approaches the train wreck that is Donald Trump. No one outside of the fringe right is going to sign onto a letter supporting Trump over Clinton.

How you can proclaim somebody to be super-smart when he changes stories 180 degrees between bedtime and breakfast is beyond me.

His speech on the Senate floor, coming just days after major brain surgery, was both inspiring and a challenge to both the Senate, the House and Americans to return to """"regular order"""", where critical policy decisions are openly, inclusively and thoughtfully debated. I can think of no more remarkable American to join Alaska's senior Senator in voting their conscience over party dogma (desperation?) and WH strong arm tactics.  Senator McCain will now be vilified by Trump, hardline Republicans and their right wing media supporters (puppets). How regretful and pitiful. He survived 5+ years in captivity in the Hanoi Hilton, endured unimaginable torture, and turned down the chance to be released. At his own physical and mental peril, he chose to stay and support his fellow POW's. I wish I could be half the man Senator McCain is.

Will Trump tear up the agreement because he can't resolve the Mexico issues?  If he does then what does that do to NAFTA and Canada where the issues less contentious?  And what about the newer issues of environment and worker mobility?  I read somewhere that the net Mexican migration is Southward nowadays, not Northward as many people believe.  Many of the North bound refugees are coming from countries South of Mexico and those are the ones that Trump is badgering Mexico to control.  Ironically we're now beginning to see a similar refugee issue flowing Northward from the US.  Perhaps Mr Trump would be so kind as to follow his advice to Mexico.  Don't get me wrong though...I'm in favour of accepting these people if they make it across the frozen border into Canada.  Anyone who lives through a journey like that can only be good for us.

At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country.

The USA has the market for the C Series so knows it is in a position to dictate terms on almost any trade matter.

0,"Good one. The election of Trump completely unhinged his opponents.  They just miscalculated, they were expecting someone like Romney or Dubya, they expected a President who would just take it. They did not expect one that would go dawn with them into the cheap seats for a dirty  brawl. Meanwhile, he's realizing his promises, his popularity is reasonable, his policies popular and , according to polls, the country is heading in the right direction. I can see why his opponents would be going nuts.

0,"They aren't a nation and appear to have little desire to be one. My experiences were in southeast Asia, a different time, a different people, a different military. Most of my generation were draftees or enlistees in the Air Force or Navy who had no intention of humping a rifle in a rice paddy if drafted. A guy I attended school with told me I was crazy to go in for four years when you could get it over in two.  The end of his service got him a nice engraving on the wall...  If Trump thinks they don't know they can wait us out he's sadly mistaken. The list of invaders they've waited out is long and growing. They may have only a 50% literacy rate but they know the Persians, Macedonians, Romans, Mongols, English and Russians have all left, eventually.

Thus, Comey will have detailed records of all of his private conversations with Trump, including the dinner where he was asked for a loyalty pledge.

Because it is impossible to get a 3d party candidate elected to mayor let alone President. Why? Because the 2 parties have written the laws in such a way to keep themselves in power. Power corrupts. Of the 2 choices forced on us by the 2 parties I will vote for Mr Trump. I vote for him not because of the R next to his name, but in spite of it. For all of his faults, and there are many.

The further away the GOP tries to get away from Obamacare, the worse its plan will be.  No matter what economic gobbledegook you spin on it, having 20 million people lose health care coverage IS the real disaster.  GOP, fix Obamacare, make this country great again.

In fact, Krein said exactly the same on every issue that the panel were asked about. Nothing special about Trumps unprovoked verbal attack on China two weeks ago - all Presidents attack China. The fact that nowhere in Trumps speech was there a single mention of the Constitution - few Presidents mention it in their speech - was the response. I then realised Krein is just a lickspittle neo-con.  Michael Moore also gave a powerful interview drawing a connection between Trump and his followers, and the Germany of the 1930's.

We have an agreement with Europe discussing with sensible people who do not try to intimidate us.
"
0,"Trump is already sending the same messages. They have extreme sanctions in place. He already negotiated with China to do the same. It's like everyone just missed that Kim started testing and making nuclear weapons. You call him Dane and in control? Ask Otto Warmnier""""s family how Dane he is. It's frightening that you think he's sane, while killing his own people and our citizens, but think Trump is crazy for talking inn defense of our country. His stance is what will prevent a war, not start one. If kim seems a nuclear missile our way, then that was his intention all along. He's not same not in control of anything.
"
0,"Therein is the issue. Foreign governments use his hotels...foreign monies. This is not really cut and dried. Seems not to be a violation. Prior to his election a Florida transaction with a Russian person paid a huge amount of money over and above what Trump paid for it and it sits run down and vacant. Money laundering? Maybe be but not proven. His treasury secretary used t run a Russian money laundering bank and now run our treasury. Too much suspicious people in the administration. Swamp getting more dirty water pumped in.

0,"You seem to have a problem distinguishing between what is (possibly) popular and what is legal. Fortunately, most judges do know the difference.. You also seem to have a problem with math.

1,"It looks more like the lunatic white supremacist billionaires have begun to take the US people on a joy ride to oblivion. Sheep, how in the world can you support Trump? He and his thugs have absolutely no interest in the average American. His choices for cabinet are indicative of that. DeVos will, for example, destroy public education nation wide as she did in Michigan. There are already signs of how poorly educated the average American is and she will nail the coffin shut. Pence will throwback LGBT  and women's rights to the dark ages. I could go on but I think you get my drift.

The left's inability to respect the outcome of an election and the repeated attempts to subvert the will of the people are the precise reasons why Trump is in the White House.

1,"During his campaign, Trump publicly requested that Putin hack Hillary's computers. That's on tape. Of course, he also said that he could shoot someone dead on Fifth Avenue and get away with it.

0,"The White House's timeline of when the President found out about Fredo's emails doesn't make sense. As suggested by his lawyer, it seems that Trump knew about the emails when he signed off on a statement about Fredo's Russian meeting, a statement that was prepared by his staff while they were flying back from the G20 meeting. That statement was proven false. Why did Trump approve a false explanation of the meeting? Why was he misleading the public? While his staff was preparing Trump's statement, did Fredo lie to Trump? Is is possible that Trump didn't know about the meeting on the day it happened? After all, he was in his office on the 26th floor while the meeting happened one floor below him. Is it conceivable that the 3 amigos met with a Russian agent and then didn't go upstairs to tell Trump the good news? And did Trump's almost immediate announcement that he was going to make a speech about Clinton have nothing to do with the Fredo/Russian meeting?
"
0,"That is what several investigations are doing. Hilary didn't do anything wrong either but that didn't stop the unfair and unjust """" lock her up"""" nonsense. We will see. In political view,  the shoe is now on the other foot. How does it feel? Trump and his supporters can stow it.

He called their assessment “ridiculous” and suggested that it had been politically motivated.  After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about him, Mr. Trump alleged that the intelligence agencies had allowed a leak of the material. “Are we living in Nazi Germany?” he asked in a post on Twitter."""" that's just 1example  - there are 4 or 5 more. opening page msn.com - new york times

That production is now moving to the US, because Trump told Ford that they would be facing heavy tariffs.  The CAMI job losses announced today - along with all the rest of the jobs at this plant - will be heading to Michigan.

I am the farthest thing from an expert on nuclear weapons but I'm guessing it's not going to take many strikes to affect the radiation levels on earth. I care, but seriously what can any Canadian do?

Science - and not """"faith"""" should be used to decide what is legitimate health care or not. It sets a dangerous pre-enlightenment precedent that has no place in a modern civilized society.

When we have to remove troops from our HEAVY combat zones to go and help an ally in a """"secure"""" zone (and end up staying there) because they won't conduct offensive operations to keep the initiative, they are worthless.

This President clearly doesn't care about these folks. How can he when he puts himself first every time? Most people want to work, they see the worth in that, they do not want hand-outs, and voting for Trump, in my understanding, was a step in that direction. Their hope for that.   I can't see that happening under Trump ever now though.  A huge part of running this country is about serving her people, and there really was not one candidate in 2016 who was willing to do that.

The priest, as usual, during the homily, said catholics couldn't support a pro-choice candidate. This policy of unconditional support for pro-life candidates would give the catholic vote automatically even to anti-catholic candidates who wanted to make catholicism illegal.

The facts in this world relate to lower job quality, higher debt, poorer prospects for young people, higher housing costs, lower quality of life, plummeting equality levels and losses on every environmental front.  Globalism, a broken financial system, and mass immigration are the major drivers of these metrics of decline.  The elites feel they simply have to explain their position more clearly or come down harder on concern and activism (now smeared as """"populism"""") to facilitate conformity and compliance.  There  is simply no comprehension of the structural problems their law making and enlightened approach will not heal.  They don't realize they are railing against the symptoms.

As president, he has not proposed or supported anything remotely similar to what he promised; in fact, he has supported a succession of despicable Republican bills, each worse than the one that preceded it, that have in common a commitment to strip health care from millions of people. The Republicans are making yet another attempt to ram such a bill, arguably the worst yet, through the Senate. Let's work and pray for the failure of this latest GOP attack on human life and dignity. On the other side of that failure, maybe Trump, having experienced some degree of success in working with Democrats on other things, will work with them on health care; maybe he'll sign on to Bernie's bill -- which, unlike the Republican proposals, looks like what he promised. Wouldn't that be a delicious irony?!

Afterward, David Rennie, the journalist who conducted the interview, was himself interviewed by Public Radio International, and he made one crucial point...  'fundamentally, Donald Trump is a nationalist — he's a kind of nationalist with a grievance. He thinks that the world has taken advantage of America for too long, it's time for America to be tougher and gruffer and more assertive and more selfish.'  So this is what we have.

0,"So!  You imply that Trump's approval at 57% is low. So why is Trudeau's 55% """"still pretty high""""?  Wednesday, January 25, 2017 The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Wednesday shows that 57% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump’s job performance. Forty-three percent (43%) disapprove.        Trudeau's approval rating hits new low (but it's still pretty high): poll Add to ... > Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's approval is at its lowest point since he became prime minister, according to an Angus Reid Institute poll. Still, at 55 per cent support, it's quite high. G&M Dec 16, 2016 ( This is the newest poll to be found, the media hasn't published any more recent ones?!)

0,"Trump's response was intended to deflect by saying that everyone at Charlottesville was hateful. Only one group, the white supremacists and the Nazis, represent a genuine hate movement, one that proposes that certain groups, based on their skin color, ethnicity or religion, are inferior to others. Those opposed to the neo-Nazis and white supremacists do not make such assertions but the opposite. """"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness."""" The words are unambiguous even if the lives and deeds of those that wrote them were not.

Did we not fire back at the time of Smoot-Hawley?

0,"Dreamers and DACA are not the same.......Dreamers were most likely babies when their parents brought them to USA.  DACA is a OBAMA created kick the can down the road illegal program.  Remember 2-3 years ago all those young adults crossing the US border invited by OBAMA.  President Trump is only talking about illegal criminal i.e.  M-13 GANG members.  Young legal adults have every right to apply to stay in the US - not crimimal young they will be deported.  I applaud President Trump, Congress has 6 months to make this better.  Obama in his first two years had the WH, Congress & Senate and he did nothing.

While NBC and CNN joined the rest of the media in rushing to condemn the Trump White House over an UNCONFIRMED Washington Post report that the President inadvertently shared classified information with Russian officials, guests on both networks provided important context that the Obama administration intentionally shared classified intelligence with Russia less than a year ago.  http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/kyle-drennen/2017/05/16/  This is why the Trump Resistance Movement will backfire on the alt-left snowflakes.

0,"There are two US  tribes with seemingly irreconcilable views on everything.  They each have their own echo chambers and 'safe-zone' bubbles.   We saw this on the night of Nov 8 when a lot of people are caught by complete surprise.  The same echo chambers for both tribes are still active  but there is one seeming distinction.  One tribe appears convinced that vast majority of people who picked Trump now regret their 'grave mistake'.   I suspect this is a further confirmation that the echo-chamber safe-zone news bubbles is still alive.  My theory :  people who voted for Trump fall between two ends of a spectrum.  (a) nationalists rejecting any globalist agenda that distributes wealth to poorer nations until every last pothole in every local street is fixed. (b) those who see Trump as toxic chemotherapy for a cancer they blame on the elites manning the gateways of US culture : press, Hollywood,  pop-divas, deep-state. I suspect these people won't be swayed by the current narrative.

Of course, we could stiffen Trudeaus spine by taking along Dion. Trump is going to boost the US oil industry while Trudeau is trying to tax it out of existence. Lets face it. Americans are going to be taking back some of their jobs that were taken overseas by the multi national oligarchs who now control Trudeau. Else, why is he still pushing free trade rather than fair trade.  Lower US corporate and individual taxes are going to put canada in a bind. Money and skills flow to better rewards..

0,"Hopefully, for the well-being of our nation, Trump supporters will recognize eventually that the web of connections to Russian oligarchs and Russian government operatives to Trump's campaign raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency. Unfortunately, we are stuck with the questionable results of the election. We have no constitutional process to prevent the inauguration of a president who may have violated his oath of office prior to taking the oath of office. The Russians have exploited this shortcoming in the U.S. Constitution. They did not back Trump and manipulate his potential supporters for the good of the United States. Responsible investigations by patriotic Americans in Congress and the FBI may help to restore faith in an election process that has been forever tarnished.

They refuse to take responsibility for their choices in life. They think all their problems are caused by those """"others"""". Their fear and resentment prevent them from following the money. That makes Trump very happy. Why do you think we have not seen his taxes? That would answer the questions about Russia too. Obama never got more than 45% of the white vote. That shocked and depressed them. That is why they want to deny the right to vote for minorities. Equality and value based on merit are social demotions for these white folks.

Both cases of episcopal stupidity are largely driven, I would suggest, by single issues: Russian nationalism there, and opposition to abortion here.  Surely Orthodoxy as a faith cannot be identified with, and must not be rejected because of the  current leadership of the Russian branch of that Church; any more that Catholicism can be identified with, and must be rejected because of the current leaders of the US branch of that Church?

The typical tactics of Hitler's Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Fascist Italy leading to the slaughter of millions of lives.  This insane ideology has no place in the U.S. governing system.  The establishment of these anti-Constitutional Human Rights edicts are grounds for impeachment.  Time for a Revolution.

Why don't you make it a project to rally help for the starving in Yemen? You could show that conservatives care. Start with writing letters to President Donald J. Trump in the White House.

It is a legitimate posit that private enterprise can be counted on to produce energy solutions when that overall cost factors make it practical to do so.  Despite your disclaimer regarding increased costs being minor, we still see virtually no wind or solar installations that pencil out economically without quite massive government support.  Trump is merely taking a path that provides less government control of economic activity.  Many companies and individuals are currently cash rich.  They are looking for investments that make sense.  At the present time, renewable energy does not make economic sense in terms of most bang for the buck.  It is a reasonable position to posit that private companies will move to renewable when practical.

Clearly, there would be far fewer negative stories if he did not provide the ammunition with his childish, petulant, bullying behavior.   In politics, there are always disagreements with policy matters, but the ferocity of the criticisms would be much more muted if trump simply stuck to doing his job, without all the crowing and infantile preening.   It seems like he cannot resist a dig at somebody anytime he's in front of a microphone.   At age 70, I guess it's too much to hope for that he'll grow up.

Its economy has stagnated for almost 2 decades and Japan is facing an economic and demographic crisis.  Moreover, the per capita immigration rate to Canada has been relatively constant since the 1950s, and recent years have seen a steady increase in the education and skill level of immigrants to Canada.

Of course Canadians should not pay for a private holiday and the Aga Khan should be more astute as should the author of this self indulgent tripe.  I would suggest the author try riding a bus once a a while and associate with the lower classes who he assumes are all to ignorant to understand his lofty ideals, and likely all Trump supporters.

They lose themselves to drugs and it consumes them where an addict can think of nothing else but how to get that next fix. Drugs trump everything. Holding a loved one in your arms as they OD and convulse, praying they survive, making deals with God for just one more chance and panicking that every breath they take will be their last. You wonder what you can't love them enough for them to be strong enough to say no. But you can't. Despite their intentions and promises that this was a wake up call, this drama plays out and again and again until one day they either quit, die or go to jail. KimmyD, I'm sorry for your loss, until an addict is ready to quit there isn't a damn thing anyone can do for them.

0,"Oddly, for a story appearing in the Globe, a paper that has been relentless in molding its comments to show Trump in the worst light possible, it seems to me they have glossed over the potentially most explosive item, namely, indications Trump intends to eliminate the alternative minimum tax, the only reason, it seems, he paid anything like a reasonable amount of tax on that 2005 return. That is the thing that makes this an interesting and potentially important story. It also introduces some confusion for how that tax works since we B know many people earning comparable incomes are paying a lot less. It also exposes that no conversation about income tax rates in the US are all that meaningful without driving into details beyond rates. The system is full of ways to legally avoid taxes, personal and corporate, across broad range of taxpayers, that it makes rate comparison meaningless.

We(U.S.) bombed Libya and killed their leader. We destabilized Iraq and Afghanistan. All of this lead to Isis. So what you should have done, was a little research, and voted those chicken-hawks out of of office. Instead you label me an idiot, because I know better.

0,"Personally I think that we can all blame Christy Clark.  She stood around too long with her foot in her mouth, all the while defending the real estate and development industries, before she signalled her seriousness about cooling down the market.  Not hard to understand her motivations when these two groups deliver a large portion of the BC Liberal Party donations, and in a year so close to an election.  Then she chose a Trump tactic of blaming foreign investors for her misdeeds, when they already understood that the market had lost it's value premium.  And on top of that, she desperately tried to regain her footing by offering interest free loans for fist time buyers rather than work on the affordability issue.  There is a lot of blame for allowing this issue to fester, but it all points back to the political motivations of Ms Clark, rather than her desire to do the right thing.

Know this though... that the moment you do anything other than to stand at attention and render reverence to the Flag and our national anthem when the bugle sounds, is the moment that liberty dies.

Trump, his father and grandfather have been ripping off the American public for nearly a century, ruthlessly exploiting any loopholes or weaknesses they could find to make money.  His father's response to the committee who questioned his less than ethical practices - """"I'm only trying to live the American dream.

Seems to me Trump has many character flaws. We can only pray that we are not lead down a path of worsening world conditions.  On the other hand, would be better off with a President Cruz or Pense?  That one is extremely hard to say.  Perhaps Trump was the best we could have in terms of Republican office seekers.  The Democratic Candidate also drew no confidence votes of the people.  She was thought to be more presidential  but people were tired of the path we were taking.  They really should understand that this path is corporatism.  Big Companies have all the flaws of big government and are even more autocratic.

"
0,"There can be no doubt that Trump has emboldened white supremacists?  There are many who voted for the GOP ticket in spite of his racial dog-whistles not because of them, hoping to advance other agendas. Many of those """"in spite of"""" voters were single-issue voters who were taught and still believe that the criminalization of abortion is necessarily always the most important political, judicial and legislative issue in elections and, further, that prudential judgments, in principle, are not in play. Trump's electoral margins were thin enough that these single issue voters may have put him over the top.  I don't have a problem with single issue voting or people prioritizing issues and choosing strategies per se. What I do object to are the erroneous claims that prudential judgments don't apply and that criminalization necessarily does apply --- because that kind of simplistic thinking leads voters to mistakenly believe that there are no other viable alternatives.

The public didn't elect these people they elected President Trump. The same thing is happening here with the Santa Suites in Ottawa. Whether it is a President or a Prime Minister when they are trying to fulfill a mandate given to them by the electorate it is high time that they ignore these gowned bozos, issue a directive and just do it regardless of what their ruling says. Our democracies should be governed by our elected officials and not these half wits.  Okay leftists flag the article and hit the uncivil buttons.

0,"McCain is practicing his Leftist spincasting. Trump is exceedingly strong. He ran the table in the election, beating the Republican establishment, the Democrats and he even beat the media. Trump is a political titan with gale force coattails, helping everyone get elected who supports his policies. (I could go one, but you get the point). President Trump is anything but weak. Who is weak is Liberal Democrats and Liberal Republicans (like John McCain). John McCain is spinning a lie about his own weakness and casting it onto the human dynamo that is President Donald Trump...  Mc-Con is hoping that none of the suckers will notice his Cain game.

Trump's policies are so much better.  We should cast our votes based on policy choices.  In any event, it is not possible to change presidential candidates at such a late date.  The problem faced by the United States in this election come largely from the Republicans ignoring the people and the Constitution, and letting Obama get away with everything that he has done.  The Republicans never seem to do anything, except go along to get along, to keep their jobs.  People are tired of career politicians, who have never done anything except be politicians.  This is what brought us Trump.  He has succeeded in business and generally hires competent people, which makes him an attractive candidate.  His inappropriate comments are simply a distraction.

0,"Perhaps a clever move by non-Conservatives--unless their financial support for the Conservative Party counts for more than their votes against Leitch.  As for the Conservative Party establishment, Leitch probably hopes to do to them what Trump did to the US Republican establishment: reach over their heads to tap into a mood of resentment and unease among conservative supporters, throw the party establishment into disarray, build grassroots financial support and make her issues the only issues anyone is talking about.  It's a clever strategy. Although her proposals are perverse and degraded on their faces (like Trump's), the strategy could work if she guessed correctly that white, mostly conservative Christian Canadians are also looking for a leader to channel their fears and resentments.  In this light, Leitch's calculus seems to be that, to really harness the right-wing vote, Stephen Harper didn't go far enough towards the alt-right view, rather than that he went too far.

0,"Aside from the environmental degradation that results from mining coal and burning it for power production, Trump's insistence on reviving the coal industry by repealing environmental rules and regs doesn't make any sense economically. Coal is more expensive than natural gas, even without regulations. For many years utilities have been switching from coal to natural gas and that trend is only accelerating with the advent of fracking, which opened up more NG reservoirs and drove the already cheap price down further.  Coal doesn't have a future as an export either, since it's still competing with liquified natural gas (LNG). In other words, Trump is pandering to coal producing states solely to curry favor with, and get the votes of, those who work in the industry, even though he can't actually fulfill his campaign promise of bringing back jobs. Coal is dying and he can't bring it back.

If you remove the left granola crunching California then Trump wins popular vote by 3 million.  Obama only won 22 percent of the voting districts. And you win those districts by POPULAR vote. So Obama has the all-time RECORD for lowest number of districts EVER for a POTUS win. Hillary only won 15 percent vs Trump winning 85% of the voting districts – one of the highest in recent history.  So Trump won over 2600 districts, and Hillary was LESS than 500.  So because California has a bunch of left granola crunchers does NOT represent the wishes of the voters coast to coast and in fact is POOR representation of the wishes of the people in the rest of the nation.

They were told something, and explored it, and it turned out to be bogus. The initial June 3 email, from which you have quoted above, in retrospect, looks bizarre.

Rare exceptions, like Romney's plan in Massachusetts, helped create Obamacare but there was little other input by Republicans. No republicans voted for Obamacare, and a wave of opponents was elected after.  With that history, it is not surprising that a) some Republicans are still opposed to gov involvement in healthcare, and b) their first contribution didn't get much support. It's only real virtue was that Republicans were actually contributing to the discussion dominated by Democrats for so long.  Trump now has an opportunity to actually fulfill one of his promises! The gridlock in Washington can actually be broken if he brings dems and reps together to work on the issue. 70 years of high school debates can finally end if we get people in Washington to discuss the issue together.

Roe, a five-term Congressman and supporter of Donald Trump was caught trying to slide the bill through Congress after a secretive rollout during the Congressional recess.  Despite the attempt to hide the legislation, veterans groups have noticed and are letting their outrage be known.  “This new tax on troops is absurd,” Veterans of Foreign Wars National Commander Brian Duffy said.  “Ensuring veterans are able to successfully transition back to civilian life after military service is a cost of war and not a fee that Congress can just pass along to our troops.  “Congress must stop nickeling and diming America’s service members and veterans.”

0,"Regarding authority, Jesus made it clear God is the ultimate authority, and it is by God's will that others are put in positions of authority over us, such as President Trump and Speaker Ryan. Nicholas Kristoff is in no such position. We are to follow the authorities as long as they do not ask us to do something against God's word. We are also fortunate in that our form of government allows us to participate, which we should do as best we can by following God's word. Kristoff is overall a good man who helps others. But he twists the words of Jesus to fit his political views and wants us to follow him. That is a dangerous thing to do, for both him and us. Compassion and aid should be a part of our national character, which can only happen through our personal character. Delegating that to an impersonal government which necessarily will use it for political purposes is not the way to accomplish that.

The 8 Republicans in the state legislature had nothing to do with creating them, it is the 68 others that outvote them on everything. HERE In Hawaii, with """"the party of the people"""" in full control, we have the worst percentage of homeless than anywhere else in the entire country. The worst housing, the worst schools, and the """"worst of"""" in several other categories. Trump nor any other national figure is responsible for that in any capacity at all.

We can't control their immigration policy. We can't control their economic agenda. We can't control their view on diversity. We can exercise some influence over trade because we trade with them on a very significant level.  The women's leadership roundtable was brilliant, working through the back door to achieve influence.  We have to live with this guy (Trump) for the next 4 years, at least, so we need to start with small achievements.  If you want to tell Mr. Trump how to behave vis-a-vis the citizens of the country of which he is president, you should feel to exercise your influence over him. I'm sure he'd be interested.

When has he ever even threatened to take such action against women during the campaign?  These attacks on Trump are classic arguments from fallacy.  Trump has more women in his cabinet, and more women advisers, than Obama did.   He has already signed into law two important bills to help women study science and succeed in business:  The Protecting Women in Entrepreneurship Act, and The Inspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators, Researchers and Explorers Women Act.  So where exactly is Trump's anti-women agenda?   I cannot find it.  People are acting as if Trump is some kind of ultra right-wing Republican, when Right Wing Republicans actually fought hard during the primaries to prevent him from becoming the party's candidate, by constantly assailing his conservative credentials.

But they have arisen in response to the provocations of the other extreme, their mirror image, who love to gloat about the extermination of the white race, white males in particular, which they have demonized as the source of all the world's problems, to be replaced by the somehow inherently more virtuous """"brown races"""", which can't come soon enough in their view.  Those extremes have been yelling at each other for decades now, in print and online, and the spiralling of hate has brought us to the present state of near civil war.  Both sides came ready to fight.

Either they believe Putin's narrative of this hacking over the facts presented by our entire intelligence community as Trump does - or they believe allegiance to their party and Trump is more important than alliegence to the People of Alaska, the People of the USA and the oath they took for office - or Putin has embarrassing Republican emails he is using as blackmail.

0,"We usually think of politicians' statements in strategic terms, as the expressions of deeper, well-considered policy views. However, we may be over-estimating Mr. Trump's capacity, or willingness, to think in terms of informed policy, and as a result may be over-analyzing and giving too much weight to his tweets.  His chosen form of communication, tweeting, by itself tells us a lot about the depth of his thinking and how long he takes to consider issues. It suggests a reactive, spur-of-the-moment decision-making process, and that as President he will make actual policy based more on whim and emotion than on study and contemplation.  I've commented before on these pages that I don't envy the people Trump has picked for major posts in his administration. I think his erratic outbursts will be a major headache for the serious policy thinkers among them, and both they and the Republican Congress could find themselves constantly surprised, undermined, and even seriously at odds with him.

As a family we were anti-war early as my brother is 5 years older, in college, but illegible for the draft.  And then you had the social changes that were a response to the very high conformity in the work world in the 50's and fathers that worked long hours, then feminism, which again allowed women much more opportunity for life choices, but removed an important support for their children if the father didn't pick up the slack, and most didn't.  I've thought for a couple of decades that world war has to be out of consideration, I doubt anybody wants to start a nuclear conflict between the major nations.   Putin is an ass, corrupt, violent, and willing and able to use his KBG background to control dissent.    I have no problem with the Russian people, but I do not like having allies with corrupted values.    Trump wants his company to build in Russia, that the basis for interest.

They embody the old saying, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.   They always have pure and holy motives, but they are riddled with hatred of one kind or another, misogyny, racism, xenophobia, crass materialism, lack of respect for anything outside their narrow values, and a host of other sins they cannot see.   When the only thing one values is interpretation of the Bible, everything else has to be viewed with suspicion, at least.

No, he's not a politician nor is he a good businessman. The fact that he's green is absolutely no excuse for his rudeness, lack of empathy, crassness, his inability to distinguish reality from fantasy, no moral compass. Trump does not have the pulse of the country nor does he care for the average Joe. Trump is self-absorbed who looks for instant gratification rather than looking at what is best for this country. I'm ashamed and completely flummoxed how anyone can stand behind this petulant child who calls himself the President of the United States.

These cancellations and requests for comments take time - time that really benefits the Trump Administration in pushing forward these travel ordinances without any formal direction by the SCOTUS.

1,"Simple math tells tale of stupidity of separatism.  New border officers, new army new government structures and so forth. All that increased expense will ultimately impoverish people. We have seen that in Yugoslavia. No separatists are better off there. So, the only reason for separatism  is interest of foreign elements (YU example, Crimea example) or interest of elite (Catalan example). The problem is of course fortified by completely disconnected governments, as ours in Canada is or one in US was (Trump would not win in any normal situation).  We are an interesting example since government keeps spending and increasing taxes, red tape and bureaucracy on such rapid pace that some turbulence is to be expected.  What will be effects of this kind of behaviours who knows, but it is for sure concerning.

So I guess U.S. president Trump can do it. We'll see what the U.S. courts have to say.  By the way,  Trump is banning people from only 7 Muslim countries from entering the U.S.A.

Where are these stories of how blacks in the NFL made it. Why aren't black players going into inter-city black communities to sharing their story? The answer is, it doesn't fit the template. Most of the stories are of young black men, making it despite the government. Being more than they can be, working, committing to a dream, or a goal. Get the government involved and the work ethic and commitment decrease. What happens to government low income housing after a few years?

I don't, personally, believe there is likely to be much more to reveal about Trump's business dealings with Russia, but his refusal to distance himself from Putin is concerning. He needs to do so, and the sooner, the better. Putin is a duplicitous character and a major bad actor on the world stage. At best, Trump is naive about him. At worst, they're in collusion.

With the EPA gutted we can diversify our economy again by allowing mining , logging , and oil drilling to move ahead full steam . By throwing out illegals , Alaskan's will have a chance at more jobs. It's long past time that a wall is built to stop the flow of drugs , illegals , and terrorists into America . Lowering  federal taxes on everyone but the richest will help everyone. When everything is considered, Trump will be great for Alaska .  Clinton on the other hand will continue Obama's policies of tying Alaskan's hands behind it's back when it comes to development of our resources .  She will continue to allow our military to sink.  She will take our guns .

He is in favor of tariffs, for example, which are a highly mercantilistic economic intervention that historically has been a direct cause of deflationary depressions. He used to be very pro-gay, pro-abortion and pro-universal health care (before he realized that Republican voters do actually oppose those things). So, no, Trump is not a conservative. In fact, many of his policies are not substantially different from Hillary's and a few of them are more liberal than hers.  Anyone wanting a choice that doesn't sound like central planning of the economy and our lives might want to vote 3rd party this November. That's my choice. I'm not a Libertarian Party member, but they're starting to make a lot of sense.

Warren's lower tax rate is primarily due to the fact that he makes most of his income through capital gains. The middle class gets squeezed because they typically get paid through salaries and 100% of it attracts income tax.  You are correct though, if we have a higher capital gains tax than others we may see a flight of capital and people leaving Canada. So the government is wise to see how Trump's first budget looks like.  Finally if the Liberals want to address inequality they should consider making this revenue neutral. In other words increase capital gains tax but decrease the middle class tax rate. The problem is this increase looks too much like a tax grab to support campaign promises.

There is no logic in them, only emotion -- defiance, stubbornness, the refusal to admit their gross misjudgment in backing a leader of historic immorality and ineptitude. And the more the rest of us hold them to it, the more they dig in. Like their Donny, they live for resentment.

The media has failed us continuously for months now, by refusing to objectively report about the issues and instead focus only on their biased hatred for the man. They force their false narratives upon us day after day, hour after hour. It's even come to the point that when a journalist is pushed around, the voters cheer their candidate and vote overwhelmingly to install him into office.  Shame on the media for their unapologetic malpractice. Just give us the facts and report on real issues. Let us make up our own mind as to who's right or wrong.

The players hurt no one with their protest. When the anthem is over, they go out and play the same as always. Trump is making a big deal of this in order to distract attention from how he is screwing up absolutely everything he can lay his hands on. We're lucky to have this little controversy; otherwise, like the last Republican president, Trump might need a very expensive war to take everyone's minds off his screwups.

0,"The only thing that makes Carson's appointment ironic is the editorial lenses through which you view it. Was it ironic that Obama was elected to lead a country that he promised to radically transform; a country that he spent much of his presidency trashing? Was it ironic that, as the chief law enforcement officer of the country he has run roughshod over the rule of law?  Obama's contempt for the sources of American greatness was tragic. But it wasn't ironic. It was very consistent with the ideological filters through which he viewed American history and Western civilization.  By your reasoning, Monte, Tom Price and Scott Pruitt are also ironic picks for their positions to lead HHS and EPA. It seems to me that you perhaps need to depoliticize your understanding of irony. It would certainly have been highly ironic for President Obama to appoint Scott Pruitt to head the EPA. And it most definitely would have been the height of irony for Trump to appoint Al Gore to head the EPA.

Is it not clear that Trump cares about only one thing, and that thing is self-aggrandizement? He keeps every magazine cover he appears on, regardless of the story. He was against outlawing CFCs to save the ozone layer because non-CFC hairspray didn't work as well. Now he tweets baseless accusations and forces his administration to burn through dwindling credibility like kindling backing it up. Trump is incapable of exiting his illusion of being smartest, most handsome, most knowledgeable man on earth. When the noise surrounding his collapsing presidency gets to bothersome, he fires off another few tweets and holds another rally, the better to bask in deserved adulation. Sad.

0,"Trump wants private investors to basically direct $1 trillion in infrastructure projects nationwide through a “revenue neutral” financing plan, which banks on financing from private investors, allegedly to control deficit spending (which the GOP generally deems wasteful, while promoting tax breaks as a wiser redistribution of public funds into corporate coffers). To draw some $167 billion to jumpstart the $1 trillion, 10-year infrastructure plan, Washington would grant a giant tax break “equal to 82 percent of the equity amount.” The goal isn’t fixing bridges so much as fixing the corporate tax codes to promote privatization and unregulated construction with virtually no public input.

0,"I actually agree with your reply to Craig Corser.  The judge's behaviour was inappropriate, for all the reasons you cited.  My question remains, however, in terms of whether the use of the term """"devastated"""" was used in an exaggerated way or if those who become truly """"devastated"""" by an election loss may in fact be suffering from some form of mental illness.  According to the media, the paralegal killed in Charlotte, would often sit at her desk in tears because of what she thought was happening to the country.   This sounds like she was truly """"devastated"""", but I did wonder whether she was getting any help at all.  Sitting at one's desk, sobbing, doesn't sound like good mental health to me.  The case against the judge was a slam dunk.  There was no need to ramp up the rhetoric in suggesting that Canadians were truly """"devastated"""" by Trump's election.  It unnecessarily dilutes the term """"devastated"""" and makes it sound like we are so easily triggered by election results in another country.

We are now at the beginning of a destabilized Europe and the displacement of middle class jobs including teachers, police, doctors and nurses through AI and video.  No Government head is prepared for this future.  In my opinion Trump has 4 years to appear to be doing something for those in the 4 named states to be re-elected.

0,"No he is not. Letting people keep their own money is the opposite of stealing. Trump is slashing regulations.  If you are worried about spending more than you have (deficits) then spend less.  Taxes have been called legalized stealing. How can reducing taxes be corrupt?  The government does not dictate a quota for children nor where you must live. Do you wish to try again?
"
0,"Yup.  Trump has carved out a clear position that is anti-muslim, anti-jew, anti-black, and anti-hispanic.  We need only wait,, I think, for the anti-asian, anti-native American, and anti-polynesian shoes to drop.  Follow his lead or don't.  That is the naked proposition.  Trump is posing what may end up being an existential question:  """"what is in the heart of an American caucasian?""""  The answer to that question implicates questions that go to America's ability to continue to exist as a democracy.

1,"My commment has nothing to do with race, you injected that for some reason.  The protest is stupid political theater that usually just goes away over time. While these ignorant protesters are standing in their mud puddle daring people to jump in and wrestle them, most folks have had enough sense to stay out of their little mess they've made and wait for their mud puddle to dry up. The one person who didn't need to jump into the mud puddle was the President. He's now drawn attention to the protest, inflaming the whole mess.  I don't care what others did or didn't do to help or hurt race relations because we have to move forward from where we are now. Sure Obama made relations worse, but it doesn't excuse Trump.

0,"Gee, kind of tough to see why this post would be censored:  It is outrageously funny to ascribe any sense of global fairness to any of China's motives.  That nation has historically been obsessively inward looking and dismissive of foreigners, to the point of overt racism.  Good luck to those nations hitching their wagon to the Chinese Express: """"America first"""" will seem like a universal declaration of human solidarity in comparison to what Beijing would have in store for the rest of the world.  Trump, for all his clumsiness, has publicly exposed the great Chinese deception: using stolen technology and intellectual property, they seek to set up a new hegemony. And, if a few crumbs fall from the table, the Chinese won't mind too much if some of their vassal slave states gobble them up.  But their ultimate vision isn't just """"China First"""": It is """"China Only"""".   Unless of course the China shills are getting a little more touchy than normal.

That may be the most astonishing and dangerous thing to come out of this horrible event. It makes Trump the first President in my lifetime (I expect ever) to suggest that moral leadership is not on his agenda. I would argue that it is the single most important job a POTUS has.

Juvenile insults like """"IQ Crazy Mika"""", """"Psycho Joe"""", and even """"DumbAsARockMika"""" and """"Jealous Joe"""" from the social media director aren't becoming of anyone past the age of 15. Mika dove into the muck with the little hands ad. This is our White House now? Seriously?!  Sarah Huckabee has no clue defending this. Trump is free to respond to his critics, but he should (and is incapable of doing so) in a way befitting the dignity of his office. Heck, even as a business professional. Ask yourself if you, your colleague, your employers, or your boss would do anything like this, let alone without ramification. Ask yourself if you'd tolerate this from your child.

(Blase Cupich, Geoffrey Robinson and of course Bill Morrison of Toowoomba come to mind). After all, Jesus was able to attract a huge following in a fairly short time with His message - which of course eventually brought him to the attention of the Temple Police (just as happened to Bill Morrison). BTW, this also disproves the assertion by conservatives that Jesus was """"counter-cultural"""", so as to justify their own stance against the naughty secular world. He was not. If he had been, the crowds would not have followed him. He was counter-establishment (i.e. the Pharisees, not the Romans). Not the Romans? Well, it was obvious to Pontius Pilate that the Pharisees had brought trumped up charges against Jesus. (Hey, """"trump-ed up"""" - I like it!).

So you can spare me your little lecture about how people ought to respond to electoral loss.

They should go to the zoo and watch a buffoon to get a reality check.  North Korea poses zero threat and danger to Canada. Russia poses no threat at all. This view is shared by all sound minds. But the country who have posed and will continue to pose great danger to Canada is the southern neighbor. The damages it has done to Canada since 1990, economically, in banking, in trade, and in wars, in terror is immense indeed. This is fact. Future danger will be greater. Our obsession should be how to protect us from the empire under immense stress of its own arrogant making. Mexico is doing exactly that.

0,"tribalism? hmmmm... is that related to nationalism and closed trade?  Because we heard pence and trump state that capitalism has failed!  “The free market has been sorting it out and America’s been losing.”- Nov 8, 2016.  pence and trump were trying to demonstrate job salvation in pence's home state of Indiana.  Based on the subsequent job departures from Carrier, in spite of trump ok'd concessions to Carrier and parent United Technologies, as well as big layoffs by Ford (among others), it doesn't appear that crony capitalism is doing very well either.  Ranger, what do you mean by 'national identity'?  I do agree that the Dems have struggled to promote a coherent message about job growth; but for all we heard from trump, we have yet to see any jobs & infrastructure bills.

In the process he awakens the masses( the common Joes) in society to take some time and understand what really is happening and why the enemy is the group he has identified. The world is being educated as never before as a result. Thank God for the Trumps of this world and their standing up to the enemies of democracy in an attempt to make the world a better and safer place for the middle class which are neither rightists or leftists.

Especially in the method of undermining the Catholic Church, that she claims to have such high respect for.  Time has shown that planting the seeds of disunity in the Church, especially to cause division between clergy & laity, was carefully orchestrated for political & personal gain.

No doubt it will be impossible to link back to Obama but you can be sure it came from someone on his staff. Democrats are desperate and they are willing to create any sort of false news while ignoring their own record. What a joke...
"
0,"Typical.. When things get tough you or your supporters  pull the gender or race card. These wonks can't get away from the fact that after 8 years the Clinton/Obama record is out there for all to see and both from a foreign and domestic policy standpoint it's possibly the worst in history. And the media has handled Trump """"benignly"""" ?? The free pass has gone to Billary for countless transgressions.

0,"Yes Canada  is back,a vote for change - all BS. The Liberals share a lot of the same  traits that made Harper so unpopular The big difference is Harper never ran this country into debt during non recession times to appease the status quo, nor did he break key campaign pledges or lie to get to office. Simply put government won the election and they are gorging on the Canadian credit card. What will be Juniors legacy be,  soaring housing cost, key broken promises,weak immigration polices ,  massive debt personal and Federal Truly a one term government, Trump Canada cant come fast enough !!!!

0,"In January he will truely be a public figure elected into public office. He is not royalty or a monarch. If he cannot stand for disagreement or the fact that more than half of the people who cast a ballot don't agree with his views than he has no business being considered the """"leader of the free world"""". Respect the office but you don't have to respect the man. Nobody owes Mr. Trump an apology.

0,"Not only does Trump not have a theory, or a plan, he seems not to remember what he says or does from day to day.  I imagine his ex-wives can testify to his inability to keep promises.  The American people have been hoodwinked into choosing a man who believes he is not accountable to anyone, and whose only principle is 'I got mine, and I'll take yours too if I want it'.  He seems bent on destroying not just this country but the world as well.

0,"Spicer says Trump did everything he could?  The man was going through his second childhood playing trucker man in a real truck-truck!  Then Trump missed his nap time and got in a bad mood and stamped his little feet and said if the Republicans didn't want to do things his special way then he wasn't doing anything at all.  I think Spicer is being a little biased and...what's his word, un-objective?

Just because Felony-Shrillary has made a career of being a scoff law does not mean that the wheels of Justice - - which grind fine and slow - - will not at some point snatch her up and deposit her in what Mark Twain once described as “strong lodgings”.  Or are you by chance operating under the delusion that she did not commit some very serious crimes in violation of national security? (and oh how I hope you will answer in the affirmative)  In any event this spastic, incompetent tin eared, arrogant shrew finally ground her own political aspirations into dust when Donald Trump won an electoral majority last November. He did not win. She booted it.  //  more to follow  //

0,"Coloradoite, thanks for that link. Very interesting and informative. However, when """"Fox was the only outlet where Trump’s overall coverage nearly crept into positive territory"""" it may be that he is doing a really bad job and that is being accurately reported in the media. He may be an incompetent, unprepared, poorly educated, impulsive, petulant, quick-tempered, egotistical, dishonest, latently racist, boorish and embarrassing clown who is clueless about how our democratic republic works, none of which is positive and that he is being reported on factually. The study does not say or imply that there is bias, only that the percentage of negative versus positive press in unprecedented...even at Fox News.
"
1,"???  Almost all the 9/11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia.  The other countries of origin for terrorists hitting the US in the last three decades are Lebanon, Egypt, and Pakistan.  Not one of those countries made the list somehow.  So it does kind of look exactly like they pulled their plan out of thin air (or their backsides) with no knowledge of US history, world events, etc.  Now I know Trump will explain that all those thousands of Muslims tailgating on 9/11 he (and no one else) saw were Syrian and Iranian or some such silliness . . . but at a certain point even die-hard Trump supporters have to start cluing in to the reality that this guy either doesn't have the necessary mental capacity to perform a job that Dubya pulled off for eight years, or the stupid act is just a smokescreen to distract while he robs the public treasury blind for himself and his cronies.  Or both -- he does appear to be a grasping sort of moron.

0,"It wasn't worth a month's pay. I wonder if GM trusts the workforce given the union demands in the negotiations. Even if they don't,  meaningful reductions at the CAMI plant are unlikely.  With Trump on the warpath over Mexico and threatening to cancel NAFTA could GM  risk a shift in  production to Mexico at this point?  They might have shifted to the US, but the deal they have with their US employees  may be no better than what they have here, plus if NAFTA is cancelled Canada may fall back to a US-Canada auto pact type agreement where favorable import terms would be available to GM only if a its production in Canada is proportionate to its sales here, so GM would need its Canadian plants. A cut back in production now would make no sense.  Of course it will be a taxable benefit.

0,"When it comes to President Trump, opponents have no problems expressing their negative opinions of him to people they have just met.  However, it is just the opposite when it comes to former President Obama, people keep their opinions to themselves for fear of being labeled a racist.

You have to laugh at how Canadian reporters are so easily manipulated by flattery and immigration lawyers seeking free publicity.

Now we have those same """"born-agains"""" lining up behind a thrice-wed bloodthirsty narcissistic buffoon like Trump (who, like Reagan, hasn't set foot in a church in decades), and a lying master of dirty tricks like Cruz, who fled the Catholic church, in Texas, for one with more voters.

1,"This isn't an analysis, this is a Democrat fantasizing about what might possibly happen if all his dreams come true and the President's son-in-law is found to have violated the law. It's kind of pathetic, really. The author has NO facts about the FBI investigation, no evidence that Kushner is even suspected of wrong doing, but because Kushner is related to President Trump, the author feels justified and ruminating about """"corruption"""" and dictatorial regimes. Maybe he should read """"The Iron Curtain"""" by Anne Appelbaum for a little historical insight into the growth of corrupt and repressive regimes, though he doesn't appear to have the intellectual horsepower to grasp the significance.

The last two times the US confronted China was when the US was overrun at Pork Chop Hill and when the US was hightailing it out of Saigon.

Then we won't have to hear from this guy or the Transgenders again.
