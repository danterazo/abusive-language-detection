The only sales tax you would pay on growing your own is the GST / PST/ HST sales tax on hemp seed, similar to the fact that the only tax you pay on beer, cider or wine making is for the fruit / concentrate, equipment and other supplies needed. Yeast can be saved and resused.  Putting a single seed in a peat packet and growing it to full size is even simpler than brewing and bottling wine or cider. I just don't see people spending billions on pot.

0,"First, how do you know that """"no prior candidate in U.S. history has ever"""" ...? When Ted Kennedy asked the Soviets for help to beat Reagan in 1984, what precisely did he ask for? Second, there is no evidence Trump, or Trump team, asked Putin for anything. Even in this Donald Trump, Jr., scenario, the offer came to the Trumps not from the Trumps. Third, as for keeping """"hostile nations out ..."""", every world power tries it (especially the U.S., either through CIA, NSA, or open means, like Barry's foray into Israeli politics), and there is no evidence that is what happened here, anyway.  What it looks like here is a lawyer for the oligarchs lobbying to remove the Magnitsky Act sanctions so they can access their stolen money abroad. DT, Jr., was stupid and naive to take the meeting; he hoped to get some dirt (as any campaign would, despite the flatulence of pols in article), that's politics, not crime.

0,"It is worth noting, especially in reply to the posting by """"Westslope,"""" that the South Vietnamese régime, in concert with the CIA """"Phoenix"""" project during the period when American troops were """"in-country,"""" went about systematically assassinating leaders of the opposition from the late 1950s until 1975. The number of """"VC"""" executed by the side the US was supporting (with considerable US assistance in that operation) probably exceeded the number of RVN leaders who eventually succumbed as a result of mis-treatment in """"re-education"""" camps set up by the Communists after 04/75 – both sides were quite capable of being very unpleasant (common in times of war).  However, the vast majority of the former Southern leadership escaped, some with considerable amounts of gold and other ill-gotten valuables. Nguyen van Thieu (who escaped to England) and Nguyen Cao Ky (who fled to California) are but two of the more outstanding examples.

0,"I would like the """"bike lane"""" on military road fully paved or just periodically swept. It's a mess and I have to ride in the road to not get flats from all the glass. I would also like the intersection at military and veterans fixed. That intersection is really hard to safely bike through to get to light rail on 200th. Also, the new structuring of the lanes on 200th and military is really bad. They squeeze me and the turning cars into one lane onto 200th plus there is no bike lane on 200th to get to the light rail station so again, I just ride in the road. My commute to light rail every morning is pretty sketchy. People drive really fast on military! Maybe more people would bike to light rail if it were safer and then less parking stalls would be needed.

0,"Victims we have become and even more apalling we are training our youth to do and interpret  interactions the same...I was profiled-victimized, It hurt my feelings, it made me mad,  Well wake up spoiled, narcissistic and spoiled people -- there has always been profiling and always will be - it's common sense communication, i.e.,.. Someone drops a gift off for you at work when you were out. Friend gives you gift, you just mssed him. A guy what did he look like? ...tall, ruddy red cheeks and dredlovks. You rush out looking for someone fitting that description. Common sense! When it involves a reported crime the same process is activated.  If you had dredlocks and ruddy checks and the police took you aside asking questions & determined you did not fit the  full description. Have you been victimized and unfairly profiled. No, but today filing a complaint has become commonplace.

1,"Do you really believe a majority of Americans believe Trump is a moron? It would take a moron to believe such a statement.  On the other hand, the President has lead and economy at a growth rate above 3%, encourage consumer confidence to record levels along with low unemployment, reduced welfare after years of unprecedented increases, etc., etc., He also defeated a group of established Republicans and a media supported Hillary. Let's see, he is also fairly successful at business, has completed major projects ahead of time and under budget, has a successful family, and a fairly attractive and intelligent wife. And he puts America first.  And Democrats call him a """"moron"""", while late night talk show hosts profit off their primarily Democratic audience.

I'm not sure we could - most cars are designed to operate within a range.  By modifying your vehicle, you've changed the range.

If every diesel owner were responsible, then the occasional puff of soot under rare conditions would go unnoticed.

0,"Was a sad story .It's easy to attack the past Alaska Women's Run director when he's dead and can't defend himself. Intentionally lost in this story by Beth Bragg is how great the Alaska Women's Run really was. It was an event that showcased women like no other.  Film crews filming the race--helicopters flying overhead , thousands of women running--made it event like no other . Bringing in top runners from around the world gave local women a chance to see how they measured up. The stink of this story is that there didn't need to be a choice between one race or the other as a few ladies forced .There could have been two races.  Today's race isn't as great as the original.  Since they wanted to question the money from the original , where has the 2.8 million collected from the current race gone ?  Name who got it. Claiming 1.2 million went to mammograms for just 3,100 women in 24 years isn't anything given that over that many run every year.  Who's getting the money from this race Beth ?

0,"I am going to get flamed for what I am about to write, but that is really no problem, as my individuality withstands even the best of the flame throwers.....  I have given careful consideration and thought unto what I have read, seen, and heard from those that support the progressive movement of Woodrow Wilson, and have come unto the following conclusion.  The current follower, or supporter of the liberal, or progressive movement has no confidence nor strength through their own individuality.  The current follower, or supporter of the liberal, or progressive movement cannot stand up for themselves as an individual, but rather as a slave to some group that they feel themselves a part of, and that, to me, is most sad.  A true conservative, and more so, a true libertarian, believes that an individual, no matter the stripe, is the most powerful entity within this once great Nation, as they believe within themselves, rather than whatever 'group' they may belong unto.  Weakness or Strength.

0,"We all know the days where cars are in ditches everywhere.  Those days are not the days where we have a solid snow pack with stable temps as in that case studdless do as well or better than studded.  The days we see all the wrecks are when it warms up and rains over the cold soaked roads.  In that condition (again the one where everyone wrecks, and costs of life and property lose go up) anyone who claims studdless tires perform as well or better is lying to them self.  This happens several times a winter, and therefore studs are justified.  I have studded tires on one of my heavy vehicles and blizzaks on a truck and X-ices on a high powered car, and the studdless do perform better in several categories, but the one they fail in is the one that matters the most.

0,"In metropolitan areas like the GTA thousands of electric two seater mini autonomous cars queued into recharging stations with on site supervisors checking for and ordering maintenance safety. A per use charge and/or taxpayer funded system dedicated to the transport system. could provide the funding.  A central computer system could respond to transport requests to private addresses or street assigned locations and preemptively redistribute empty vehicles according to use requests and anticipated demand. It would not be without technical and implementation issues but over time could be refined to work seamlessly and effectively. It would cost millions and take years to implement but would eventually remove thousands of passenger vehicles from the road.

0,"What conservatives need to do is show how their policies improve economic conditions for everyone in a a manner that fosters freedom by increasing opportunities for all of us to actively participate in the creation and accumulaton of the wealth we need to obtain housing, medical care,  and food made affordable through market forces not regulations or subsidies both of which pass money through our hands into the back accounts of producers of products and providers of services that may be big businesses and the regulations ones that favor them.  Economic and tax policies that increase jobs and profits also may increase tax revenues and lessen the need for government financial assistance thus making it possible to lower taxes and cut government budgets.
"
0,"I agree.  While I feel that having 55 electoral votes in a winner-take-all election is terrible, regardless of political party, I think the solution is less complicated than splitting into three states ---- although that really isn't a bad idea.  My solution is to abolish the CA Democratic Party and replace it with any 3rd party that can gain a foothold.  Think about it:  The Democratic Party has been a terrorist organization since the days of Andrew Jackson.  Here in California, Dems were the ones that engineered stripping the Californios -- the original Spanish and Mexican settlers -- of their land.  Today, these devious scoundrels continue their selfish ways by claiming to present an inclusive social policy, all the while merely accumulating political power for themselves.

0,"The problem with prosecuting anyone belonging to an entity calling itself a church is the protection of free practice of religion that is explicitly stated and guaranteed in the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights.  These days that means federal and state law enforcement agencies tend to tread very lightly when it comes to charging any church member of a crime unless an act rises to the level of something flagrant such as mass murder or mass rape.  Speaking just of federal law enforcement, there continue to be bitter memories and internal recriminations surrounding federal involvement in the Branch Davidian (a Seventh-day Adventist offshoot) fiasco in Waco, Texas in 1993.  It's unlikely you will see such a direct and heavy-handed federal approach to """"save the children"""" ever again.  To any deeply religious person:  as a general rule of thumb, if you should happen to find yourself on church property typically referred to as a """"compound,"""" consider it a sign to get yourself gone.

"
0,"Fair point. My experience is that parishioners do a pretty good job of taking care of their own needs. If a pastor is incompetent or overbearing, they walk. They may find another congregation (or denomination) more to their liking or they may drop out entirely, but most will not put up indefinitely with a bad pastor.  As for the seminarians I mentioned, my recollection is that, on the whole, they weren't bad guys. They were just young and arrogant as recent graduates often are. They were the kind of people John Wooden was talking about when he said, """"It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.""""  They left the seminary knowing it all. I would bet most of them have learned a lot since then.

0,"I will grant you that Leo XIII's Apostolicae Curae didn't go over especially well with the Anglicans, but that was more than 100 years ago. Also in the past century bishops from the Old Catholic Church (recognized as valid by Rome) have participated in numerous episcopal consecrations in the C of E. Apostolicae Curae's main points rested on the wording in the BCP as revised in 1552 under Edward VI, relegated to the dustbin by Mary I between 1553 and 1558, and then reimposed in 1559 by her sister Elizabeth. The language that was objectionable to Leo was removed in 1662. From Rome's perspective, all legitimately ordained/consecrated priests and bishops had died out by that point, and the wording in the BCP meant no one ordained since that point was valid. With the wording restored about 100 years later and the participation of bishops from the Old Catholic Church since the 20th century, it is possible/likely that the impediment Leo recognized no longer exists.

The best that they could achieve in 2019 would be to split the centre-left vote and possibly let the CPC sneak in.  Maybe the could hold the balance of power in a Liberal minority government?  Trudeau would not countenance that for long; too constraining on his ego.  Similarly, the CPC lead by Andrew Scheer has slim to none chance on their own of defeating Trudeau and the Liberals in 2019.

If this carries on, this reality TV show is going to have a terrible ending.

Not all Muslims are islamists, some would-be immigrants are actually trying to escape from the islamists.  We should be able to tell the difference, and accept those trying to escape, while refusing the islamists.  But if we are too stupid to be able to tell the difference, as we were apparently too stupid to tell the difference between ordinary Germans, Jews, and N*zis, then I guess we are stuck with Trump's blanket ban based on country of origin...

0,"Funny how some people will automatically take the side of a lawless cop. See how making silly assumptions works?  Cops are every bit as susceptible to abusing power as any other person. Most do not cross the line. Some, inevitably do. When there are no consequences for cops, society, criminals, and cops themselves lose.  There is less respect for cops from citizens. That's because the Blue Wall makes it difficult, at best, to know which cops are crooked and how many of them there might be. People will be less able and willing to assist cops in doing their jobs.  Criminals treated in a criminal manner will surely gain no respect for the law, and thus the chances for rehabilitation shrink drastically.  Society also loses in terms of higher crime rates, increased payouts in civil suits, and the lack of security in their homes and everyday lives.

Peggy Billingsley is the only one (so far) in this thread to put her finger on the central fact about addiction: like other mental illnesses,  it invariably involves intense internal conflict.  The addict is still himself, the person you've always known . . . and yet he isn't.  A sort of shadow self seems to have taken control of his behavior.  As countless recovered addicts and alcoholics can testify, it's possible to close the door on that false self.  Most of them acknowledge that some sort of intervention was crucial to their recovery.

Pebble knows what the local ideas are already.

I'm all for the studies, study the he[[ out of it, it brings in money locally, but I don't think any of it should be built.  It's foreseeable that the state should keep it's ear to the train tracks and begin to change how much it earns and collects from mining proceeds on mega projects, in the interest of the citizens of the state of Alaska.

"
0,"I see three problems with this argument: 1. Both Fortis and Hydro One are in the distribution and transmission business; not the generation business.  They like investments where they can manage a regulated rate of return rather than the big risks of these generation projects.  2. No company is going to invest in big generation projects like these without a long-term purchase agreement for the output.  This transfers much of the risk back to the public sector.  You can look at Ontario to see what happens if you do not get the pricing on these agreements right.  3. Properly run government utilities provide both a fair rate of return to their owners and low rates to their customers (the same).  There is a greater tendency for privately owned  utilities to sacrifice low rates in return for a greater financial return.  Private-public partnerships, bringing the rigor of private sector ownership to specific projects without selling the utility, is a more positive solution.
"
0,"Of course, any person is """"presumed to be innocent until proven guilty"""" by a court of law. There is a presumption of innocence, not actual innocence or guilt. Whether the alleged perpetrators are actually guilty or not is determined by the court, so at the time that the matter has been reported and is being investigated / speculated upon, the accused party may be innocent or may actually be guilty as sin.  If the facts in the SAP CAD matter as reported are correct, it is very difficult to see how a reasonable person, or more pertinently an independent Judge might determine that the contract was lawful and above board. It would be clearly unethical, but being unethical is not in itself a crime.  The big issue right now with all the state capture and Gupta allegations is not whether or not crimes have been committed, but the fact that there appears to be no appetite whatsoever on the part of the police to investigate the matters, and the prosecuting authorities to prosecute.

It seems to me that our Church has it whichever way suits it at a given moment. When the 'headquarters' (whether national or international) wishes to act decisively, then it does so, imposing its will on diocese or parish, as the case may be. But when it suits the 'centres' to distance themselves from the 'frontline' (for example, from an abusive priest) then suddenly the priest is not even considered an employee of the bishop.

There are lots of minority groups in the Western world.  They aren't becoming terrorists.  Muslims - both born and converted - are.   And not just in the West, obviously throughout the Muslim world as well, where far more people die.  Most Muslims are indeed peaceful people, yet there is enough in that belief system to trigger certain types of youth to violence and lust for power.  And quite frankly, the larger Muslim community is just not doing enough to excise this element from their midst.  How this will be resolved is anyone's guess, it's gone too far, too much of the blame game has gone on, and continues to go on.  But at least let's call a spade a spade and move on from there.

There have been violent killings on both sides of this conflict, including people being burned alive by the opposition. (Several months ago, the analysis I saw demonstrated that the casualties were roughly equal on both sides, although this may have changed.) Many of the protestors are armed, so it is not surprising that police have also responded with violence.  Support for the opposition is centred mainly in the upper and middle classes, while support for Maduro is strongest among the poor. So, this is a complex situation and neither the government nor the opposition is without fault. In my opinion, the alternative of the opposition may be as bad or worse than the government. So, how will sanctions help?

The Gong Show that has constituted  Trump's international meetings to date has held up his incompetence in this area to great ridicule.

During his phone call with Putin, he had to Putin on hold while he asked his aides what the nuclear START Treaty is.  The friendly confines of a meeting with the affable Leader of the US's biggest trade partner, closest ally and immediate neighbour may allow the President to be seen as actually able to  converse with foreign leaders in something approaching a sophistication worthy of his office.  I expect that the meeting will go well.  .

0,"Want to know when an election is around the corner without checking your calendar ?  Just watch for all the anti-Don Young letters to start showing up in the Dispatch .  One would almost suspect democrats organize a letter to the editor write in campaign against him.  What are the odds that before an election people just happen to all agree to write in and trash Young ? Slim and none. The problem democrats have is that no matter how badly they wish Young would be defeated---they are never able to find a really good person to run against him. They nominate losers to run against him and wonder why they've lost over 20 elections in a row against him. One person they nominated to run against him had a beef with TSA so she boasted she won't fly again. It didn't take a rocket scientist to ask how she planned to get to and from D.C . The last guy was a hundred years old . Why would voters replace one old guy with another ?  Instead of writing letters , they ought to find a decent candidate.

0,"Thousands of years is but a drop in the ocean of time.  It is indeed correct to say that everyone is an African.  That is where all human life began.    Africa is thus the only continent that humans are indigenous to.  Everyone else is an immigrant.   The difference is that some people came to places earlier than others did.  The species Homo Erectus is first documented leaving Africa 1.8 million years ago, long before Neanderthals or Homo Sapiens appeared.  The general opinion of scientists today is that both of these species evolved from the common ancestor of Homo Erectus.  Neanderthals did not originate in Europe.  The earliest human remains in America are from Kennewick Man, in Washington.  The University of Copenhagen in Denmark did a DNA analysis of these remains, and determined that he shared DNA from both ancient tribes in East Asia, as well as Siberia.  So there is no such thing as Native Americans.  They simply arrived here 8,000 years earlier.  We really are all Africans.

Just like the constant griping-with-no-action we also have right now about Saudi Arabia, it isn't remotely a partisan issue, it's that our leaders (Canada, US... every developed nation in the world) are all guilty of having no guts and kicking the can down the road for perpetual electioneering.  Harper signed an arms deal with S.A., Trudeau confirmed and ratified it.  Obama, Clinton, Bush, Bush, all pitter pattered on Korea, Iran, and doing anything meaningful with Israel/Palestine.  Truth be told though, when you look at the last decade of """"action"""" from Canada/US policy, it probably ends better when we do nothing than when our governments try to step up (Arab Spring, Syria, Libya, Iraq... etc).

0,"Donald Trump’s speech in Poland may have attempted to camouflage its Fascist undertones with some Nazi-bashing, but no one will be fooled. The speech was probably shaped by alt-Neo-Nazi Steve Bannon, White House strategist and enabler of the white supremacist roll of toilet paper known as Breitbart. Like all Fascist speeches, it configured the Fatherland as weak and a laughingstock, threatened imminently with being wiped out. It is this paranoia and poor self-image that drives Fascist aggression. Above all, Trump upholds the values of fear, timidity and paranoia. A small radical fringe in the Muslim world cannot menace America’s civilization. But a far right white nationalist president with serious mental issues can.

0,"On corporate taxes that is true, but the US has THE highest corporate tax rate in the OECD.  Compared to the Nordic Countries which the left loves, our total corporate tax rate (federal + provincial) is actually slightly higher.  As for top marginal rate, we are the third lowest amongst province and territories (Only Nunavut and Northwest Territories are lower although Saskatchewan will be next year), but when compared to the US, our top marginal rate is 47.7%, which is higher than over 40 states in the US.  Their top federal rate is 39.6% while ours is 33%, but their typical state tax rate is usually around 5-7% thus average top rates between 45-47% so slightly lower than us.  Off course if Trump cuts taxes we will lose even more.
"
0,"Wow, this does not say we need to make more revenues, it says we have a fiscal imbalance. It is the governor and legislature who says we need to get more revenues. Cutting the budget would be a more proactive action toward a fiscal balance. I'm so impressed-the truth will out! Including the truth that the CBR, Statutory Reserve and Earnings Reserve are all liquid and available to those who have the will to use (not over-use) them. Even having spent more than $14 Billion on deficits, we still have about $14 Billion in reserves. Additionally, the Earnings Reserve receives automatic infusions, based upon the PF's net income over 5 years, each year. That $14 Billion was supposed to prove out the Governor's assertion that the Earnings Reserve would be gone in three years. Fortunately, the tax and spend House Majority was not allowed to make that spend it all attitude a fiscal fact this year. The PFD is PF revenue and is passed to the state for shareholders, not government.

Mr. Moniz also was a part of the disastrous nuclear agreement with Iran that will allow then unfettered access for that terrorist state to becoming a nuclear power.

Rick Perry ran the state of Texas for 15 years, and is the longest-serving governor in Texas history.

So, you're essentially labeling all who don't agree with your view as """"bigots?""""

Jesse Jackson once remarked:  """"At night when I am walking, if I hear footsteps behind me, I'm always glad to see a white instead of a black person when I turn around.""""  Thus, even a noted black leader will lump perfectly innocent, law-abiding, hard-working, honest blacks in with black criminals;  that's definitely unfair.  What is the solution?  Perhaps eliminating entitlement programs which unfairly give an advantage to blacks over other groups.  That causes a great deal of resentment.  Everyone should make a concerted effort to """"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."""" That is, always try to be respectful and polite to others, regardless of the color of their skin or social status, even if provoked  The progressive MSM and US A.G.s, Holder & Lynch, were definitely on the side of blacks who were found to have incited violence -- Treyvon Martin and Michael Brown. That also causes resentment.  Minerva should always be blindfolded.

Those folks are new Canadians who bought their way here, for themselves and their student children and spouses.  It is important for newspapers to make that clear, because THAT is what actually caused house prices to skyrocket in Vancouver and Richmond and South Surrey and other places, NOT foreign buyers or what most people assume when they hear """"domestic buyers"""".

0,"(Continued) . Which brings us to resources, and resource-based economies. . Non-renewable resources are particularly problematic, because:  (i) they tend to have enormous negative externalities that are not captured in the marginal cost of extraction; (ii) they tend to be highly cyclical in terms of market prices; (iii) they tend to be highly unstable - prone to boom and bust cycles; (iv) they are prone to creating inflationary bubbles; and (v) they tend to have legacy costs that persist long after the extractive activity has been wound up or gone bankrupt. . Further, certain resources, most notably oil, have a remarkable tendency to provoke, or to be the central focus of, wars.  That is an entirely separate scale of negative externality.  (WWII - Grozny, Baku, Ploesti in Europe; Battle of the Atlantic; Siege of Malta; the entire Pacific war was fought over Japanese access to Dutch and British oil fields in the far east; Biafra; Iran-Iraq, Gulf War I & II, South Sudan, many others).

0,"Pew, pew pew pew. I didn't dig into the survey to see more details on what was asked. What I know is that most Americans support some level of government control of gun ownership. Restricting mentally ill and dangerous felons from owning guns, restricting some types of gun (fully auto), background checks, etc.  However, when people talk about sensible gun control, the consensus ends. Many take that term to mean extreme restrictions like only allowing police to have guns or only allowing single shot hunting rifles.  The general term """"gun control"""" means considerably different things to different people.  I support limits on who can buy, based on mental health or criminal background. I do not support magazine limits or restrictions on semi-autos, other than background checks. I support laws enforcing liability to anyone who intentionally or through neglect, allows kids to gain access to loaded firearms.  In other words, sensible gun control!

I fly both airlines constantly and there is no difference between them overall in service level. I fly Air Canada far more because they are a true international airline and WestJet can't really even be compared in that regard.  I have had good and bad experiences on both.

In the 1980's the """"fund"""", which had no money in it, was abolished.  Under Chretien's Liberals the EI tax (and, to be clear, Canada's EI is very definitely a tax and NOT an employment insurance program) was kept artificially high while benefits were slashed.  The result was that the tax brought in far more revenue than the social programs loosely attached to it, but as with all taxes the money just goes into general revenue.  There was a paper calculation of how much money would be in an """"EI Fund"""" if such a fund were to exist, but there was never so much as a dime in any such fund.

In the US they can get flood insurance, but that is because the US government subsidizes it. The taxpayer gets stuck with the costs of insuring the inevitable.  Before I bought a house in Calgary back in 1980, I read the Calgary Flood Study, issued in the 1970s shortly after the floods of the 1960s. Guess what? It predicted exactly what happened.

For instance, go to any government department and see how their spending ramps up at the end of the fiscal year.  Gotta spend it or we don't get it next year.  Instead, they should do a zero based budget each year and decide what it is needed.  Good housing would be a start!

0,"Going at-grade from Middle St would save on upfront costs, but it would also increase operating costs and reduce long term benefits.   It would require the City to either terminate the driverless system at Middle St and have riders transfer to the at-grade system -  or convert the entire system to one with drivers.  The automated system reduces operating costs by eliminating the need for drivers and also allows for more frequent service.   At-grade systems are slow, averaging 12-15 mph in urban areas compared to 25-35 mph for grade-separated systems.   This means that riders would have longer travel times which would reduce ridership.  Additionally, it would mean that the City would need to operate more train sets to achieve the same frequency since each train set would take longer to complete a round trip.   It would also cause significant traffic impacts at the street level. The bottom line is, if the City wants significant transit ridership, grade-separated rail is a must.

Chelsea spent years with her Mom on facetime and telephone calls while her Mom travelled to France to learn about child care for the masses.  Hillary lies, is careless and reckless with top secret and classified emails. Hillary needed a Village to raise her child,  keep her husband entertained, and to explain What went wrong in Benghazi,   so  what difference at this point does it matter?

The fact is this-- the number of people attending mass weekly has declined severely, and in case you haven't noticed, the pews are typically filled with people over the age of 60. You cannot expect """"your church"""" to stay open when you literally enter it twice a year.

Kushner's father is in prison for gaming the system - greed and graft. Kushner visited jail on weekends throughout a Harvard education that was bought for him by a $2.5 million investment in the university from his father.  Kushner is backed by Chinese funders who covered him after he lost to high-risk investments.  Many US economists say their economy is at full employment and Trump's promise of job creation is not going to be very likely. So what exactly did Trump ride in on? Hate always supports might makes right- or don't you know about the millions of people killed in history because of it.

You may have a different definition of such, that's fine respectfully AL CUMMINGS; but in the eyes of many it's cheating, and it reflects on a candidate's integrity and ethical standards, as well as the media source and the party.   Very few lies? Like taking sniper fire in Bosnia? Like her daughter was a block away from ground zero on 9/11? Who she was named after? There was no classified info on her personal computer?

As the story is told, Mary, Joseph, and Jesus returned to their home. The return emphasizes that they were refugees, rather than immigrants, that is ready to make a permanent home in the land of the Egypt. - Though the gospel story is mute on this, it would seem that anyone crossing the border had little if any meaning to Egypt. - Today, most countries have laws that prevent and or control the entry of peoples. USA is such a country where most permanent immigrants are here according to the law. USA also has legal processes to help entering refugees, and asylum seekers.

Instead, if the physicians at the hospital would face murder charges if there was even an 0.001% chance that the baby's life would be saved by treatment in the U.S., and they hindered the parents taking the baby there, and thus the baby died... then this whole thing would not have happened.  And the burden of proof that the treatment would not have had any chance at all of saving the baby should fall on the accused, since the basic legal principle of innocent until proven guilty is satisfied by the burden of proof being on the prosecution that they had hindered the parents taking the baby for the experimental treatment.  Always err on the side of life, because we aren't able to resurrect the dead.

To be sure, Kellie Leitch and Chris Alexander are casualties of that; in Alexander's case he just finally snapped at the smear job the media were doing --- understandable, but probably fatal.  Caplan has carefully tiptoed past the presence of Erin O'Toole and probably Lisa Raitt in the leadership contest.  Both of them are a match for anyone on the Liberal front benches --- especially Trudeau --- and more importantly, represent a pragmatism that Caplan is trying to pretend does not exist in the Conservative party.

But if examined on the basis of total funding per capita to indigenous communities, aboriginal communities receive far, far more than is provided to non-aboriginals. For example, Nunavut (created to be a model of aboriginal self-government) receives per capita annual funding from the federal taxpayers of $42,055 (yes, that's right, a family of four in Nunavut receives annual support of $168,000 from federal taxpayers). That compares to the per-capita funding from the federal government for all Canadians of $1,986. Federal funding for Nunavut per capita is over 20 times greater than the average for all Canadians. How meaningful, then, would any claim be that Nunavut is underfunded in one given area of government services?

China would threaten to start WW III over this and even allies would insist we just can't follow through with this or they could even become our adversaries.  The only option for the US is a conventional invasion, which would cause North Korea to attack the South and bring them into the war too.  Also, China would not tolerate an invasion resulting in their border now occupied by an opponent.  So, China would be forced to do the invasion themselves to preclude this and topple Kim and his military, especially if he has already lobbed a nuke at South Korea too and started the radioactive contamination.

Over the past decade, at its current rate of economic growth, SA's economy has all the jobs and skills it needs. That's why unemployment (and poverty) is persistently high, and worsening. Many believe SA has excellent, 'world-class' companies and practices but how can it be when math, science and general education is ranked last? Education, innovation and competitiveness go together and SA is not, as world rankings prove. These lead to growth, development and prosperity. Twenty years ago, even with its problems, the country had the ability to move up the development scale but with its policies, decisions and practices chose to be 'analogue in a digital world'.

This has nothing to do with actual needs in the budget or the projected deficit.  Your analogy breaks down.  It is rather this:  Imagine that you select an item priced at $8.50.  You only have $6.50 to pay for it but before you can pay you have to give the person in line behind you  50 cents-- because you agreed to do so if you had more than $6.00 at the time of the transaction.  Now you have to figure out how you come up with the rest of the money.  That is how the kicker works and why you never put things in the constitution.  Oregonians are great at voting into law various means to rebate taxes.  On finding ways to fund education and health programs.... not so much.

If he had had women apostles he wouldn't have been taken seriously, miracles notwithstanding.)  There is good reason to think that Jesus didn't want a married woman to live a life of dire poverty if her husband decided to leave her (a Jewish woman could never leave her husband), which was the fate of a divorced woman at that time.  That is not the fate of a lot of divorced women in the 21st Century.  You know, I wouldn't worry about my salvation as long as I am truly loving.

Apparently someone has done a VERY good job managing the investments. I saw the pension benefit in net income for years and thought it would reverse. It did not.  But I do see at note 12 that they have a big accumulated pension loss in other comprehensive income while reporting pension benefits in net income. That might be worth exploring.  The bottom line though is that CN has been an absolutely fantastic investment and extremely well managed which I credit primarily to Paul Tellier who got it on the right track years ago.

A notable woman in the church of Cenchreae, she was trusted by Paul to deliver his letter to the Romans.[1] In writing to the church that almost surely met in her home,[2] Paul refers to her both as a deacon (Gk. diakonon masc.) and as a helper or patron of many (Gk. prostatis). This is the only place in the New Testament where a woman is specifically referred to with these two distinctions. Paul introduces Phoebe as his emissary to the church in Rome and, because they are not acquainted with her, Paul provides them with her credentials.”

I guess in the practical sense I don't see any less a priori protection of minors with new transgender restroom laws than what present laws afford...both provide zero. But both vulnerable groups need protection.  Allowing transgender people to use the bathroom matching their identity improves life for one vulnerable group without affecting the other in any practical sense. But addressing the needs of both requires us to address the root cause at its root, long before anyone needs to use the restroom.  And ultimately, that was my point. How do we start to do that?

My question is if the department made it's officers aware of this fact or not.  It makes a huge difference in his actions. If department did not provide adequate training, guess what? The department is in big big trouble. If the officer was informed in the Supreme Court ruling, then he is in big big trouble.  If the officer was somehow correct and law allows the blood draw without the search warrant, then no wrong doing on the part of the officer.  All in all, this should have been hashed out between th hospital and law enforcement way in advanced before it came to this.

One difference over the years has been that there are now a lot more (highly priced) seminars on how to decrease taxes through various means on the greyer shade than we or our accountant (and probably you) would be comfortable with. On the CBC site there were some suggested tweaks.  One of them was that businesses had to have a certain number of employees threshold, which makes sense.  The problem isn't so much actual small businesses who contribute to the economy but with individuals who incorporate simply to avoid paying taxes. The messaging on this was very bad.  Whoever thought it would be a good idea to scapegoat doctors, who do have offices, staff, expenses, like any small business, should be sentenced to a week in the hospital.

There's ample video and audio evidence to demonstrate he's always used this strategy; HRC is gambling that independent and undecided voters will break her way when presented with evidence (his own words) that this is a long term pattern.  It's just politics, but Mr. Trump is the one driving the news. All he had to do was apologize, wish Ms. Machado well, and the whole thing would have been over.

It's a national scandal that will require federal level intervention to uniformly outlaw the practice.

But there are three other significant positions in Church governance which have no sacramental or liturgical role, and which canon law says cannot be filled by women. Bishops have supreme legislative, executive and judicial power within their own dioceses with canon law being their only restriction. Canon law permits the delegation of executive power to vicars general and episcopal vicars, and judicial power to judicial vicars, but Canons 478 and 1420 require all of them to be priests. Canon law permits women to be chancellors but their role under canon law is to take care of the bishop’s curia records and archives. The prohibition on women performing important administrative and judicial functions without a dispensation from the men in the Vatican is pure clericalism, which Pope Francis has often condemned. He can change this with a stroke of his pen.

0,"AST is a great organization, but they get taken advantage of in some areas. The APD-AST issue over Girdwood is an area of legitimate issues for both organizations, but areas like Mat-Su, Haines, etc, really need to step up and either form organized police forces, or expand them to take on the responsibilities of their area.  North Slope is the only borough police entity that covers multiple jurisdictions (several other city-boroughs have cops, but only cover their small area). Mat-Su is the 2nd most populated area of the state, surpassing Fairbanks, but relies almost exclusively on AST (WPD and PPD being municipal).  The Legislature needs to push down some stricter requirements for either state taxes to fund law enforcement, and/or stricter requirements for borough and local governments to take on providing some measure of law enforcement in their areas. Mat-Su has been slacking for a long time in emergency services as a whole, and it can't keep going in an urban center.

But if they don't choose to fight, treat them with the highest and best of soldierly compassion.  Care for them.""""

Some here say that uncertainties and predictions being off are suggestive that the science is not settled.  This is simply not the case.  Models change, but the overall observations are still sound.  Saying that specific predictions are difficult or questionable does not earn the label ‘denier’, if the evidence itself is recognized for what it is.  Science can be imperfect as the scientific process plays out,  but it’s it’s the best we have.  And it’s a far cry better than people’s uninformed feelings.

Any serious crime, such as murder, kidnapping, or sexual assault is handled by the Federal law enforcement and federal courts. And for the vast majority of the tribes in the Southwest it has worked out far better then what has happened in Alaska.  The tribal judges that I am familiar with have law degrees, and  the tribes have codes of law. In fact, the tribal courts are often better functioning then the state courts. In the lower 48, in the states where there are reservations  ( are not Public Law 280 state's) the Tribe and the Feds are the law. The state law enforcement cannot come onto the reservation unless they have permission and they have no legal jurisdiction unless the tribe gives it to them. Many of the tribal law codes have been re-written to update changes to comply with federal law. Justice delayed is justice denied

With the rail you can reduce frequency of some country-to-town buses and use those buses as shuttles to and from the rail stations instead.  Rail cars come, I think, every 7 minutes, so if you run shuttles every 5-10 minutes during peak times the queue won't be long because everyone won't be arriving on the same shuttle.

0,"The starting point in the determination of the potential pay back for high speed rail should be a logistical analysis, ie. an analysis of traffic patterns. For example, what is the number of vehicles, broken down by autos and trucks, for trips from/to Windsor/Toronto? London/Toronto. Ottawa/Toronto? The voters should have these figures to ponder in order to assess the wisdom of the Liberal plan. As sure as day follows night, there is zero possibility that the Liberals government has any idea of what the suggested logistical analysis would produce. And here endeth the lesson on the stupidity of politicians who do not know what the word logistics means. And the possible benefits such analysis could bring to the decision to invest public funds.

Among items seized from his home were a shortwave radio/receiver (quite common among Americans of Japanese ancestry then) as well as his hunting rifle and shotgun, plus a long-barrelled 7.65mm Luger pistol he purchased in the late 1920s.  The radio and the long guns were recovered after the war, but the Luger was not.  Of that he was told, """"Sorry, buddy.  It's lost and can't be found.""""  Yeah, sure.  Lost to a family now on the Mainland probably.  Oh, and by the way, he had no criminal record whatsoever and was born in the Territory of Hawaii so was an American citizen to boot.

It will start out small like the federal income tax did. It turned into the monstrosity it is today with a collection agency not suitable for a free people. The bills of government belong to all citizens not just those who work. Marx & Engels favoured the income tax in their “The Communist Manifesto”. Our Founding Fathers did not support a direct tax on individuals because it was detrimental to individual liberty & private property rights. They choose tariffs which is a consumption tax. A flat sales tax is a consumption tax. Under a flat sales tax, everyone is involved in paying the bills not just the workers. Politicians would not be so quick to implement new spending programs when all residents are involved in paying the bill.

I would love to see common liturgies happen in communities, so that people can really see that “the other church” members do profess and act on a love of God and other people.  Arguments over theologies and practices, starting in the first century, have led the People of God to a fractured Christianity, where too much energy is given to showing how “We” are right and the “Others” are wrong.

In that order are the 3 largest recipients of our PFD deposits. I admit our family's PFD's went to foolhardy expenses such as college and orthodontics, but darn it, how do we replace the $8 billion/yr that used to gush out of the ground? No gold revenues, no fish fees, no lumber surcharges, no sales/income taxes, no Raid on the Permanent Fund will ever replace that. If we skim $8 billion/yr from the Perm Fund it'll be drained in 7 years. Skimming 3% saves the corpus, yet starves the poor IRS, CSED and Muni/Courts.

The calculation is inasmuch as 14 years of the Liberals have resulted in Ontario being the most indebted sub-sovereign jurisdiction on the planet as well as among the highest taxed jurisdictions in North America and yet the voters keep re-electing the them it is OK to offer this latest bribe because higher debt and taxes are of such little concern to Ontarians.

0,"They certainly have postulated runaway AGW. I hear it constantly. Consensus is not science. Science is about prediction, not straw polls. If a science cannot predict then it is useless, regardless of the consensus. Consensus is usually anti-science. 1000 years ago, the consensus was that the sun orbited the earth. I don't think many deny that CO^2 will lead to or is at least correlated with rising temps. It's the hypothesized feed-backs that amplify the predicted increases up to 4x (4 degrees v 1 degree) that are the points of contention. The feed-backs are not observed and the models have repeatedly failed to predict. Regardless, even if it was warming 1 degree or even 3 degrees by 2100, what should we do about it? De-industrialize? The human suffering and cost associated with that course would vastly exceed any benefit of lowering temps. Historically, warmer periods are beneficial to humans and expand the biomass of the earth.

The VA is a nightmare, with tens of thousands of Vets on the streets waiting for care.  Simply banning panhandling will do nothing to address the many issues the homeless and impoverished face.

The diocese got a recently retired priest to run the parish until the pastor was back on his feet. The interim pastor was going over the books, and saw payments to suppliers that raised red flags: payments to companies selling religious goods that he had never heard of, the purchase of about 20 years supply of cleaning materials and so on. So he called the bishop, who whistled up some financial auditors. It turned out that the pastor had embezzled over a million dollars. The diocese was able to recover most of the money, and I believe that the pastor did not actually go to jail.  The bishop had financial controls on parish funds put in place, with instructions that they must be followed.

There  are hypocrites who will wave papers around proving Sheriff Joe Arpaio broke the law while, in the very same post, ignore all the myriad of laws that were broken by the ones he arrested.

They did not have arms to defend themselves. Mao Zedong was even worse. An estimated 40-70 million fellow Chinese died under his regime. Communist China did/does not allow the general population to own arms. Adolf Hilter’s regime made it illegal over time for the ordinary citizens to own or posses firearms. His regime and what happened is well known. """"The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes.... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.""""

When Cheney cast the tie breaking vote for the second round of deficit inducing tax cuts he infamously made the statement, """"Reagan proved that deficits don't matter"""". True that. Deficits only matter when they can be used as cudgel against Democratic administrations. I've seen estimates that as much as 40% of the current deficit are because of those two tax cuts. Add in the ungodly war of choice against Iraq, zero funding for the Medicare Part D giveaway to PHARMA(close to $800 Billion) and zero funding for No Child Left Behind and you've got some pretty big numbers.

0,"Your take on how the Liberals have failed to follow the SCC decision on physician-assisted death is absolutely right.  I just want to point out that your statement on 'a law's normal course' is mistaken (""""A law's normal course is that Parliament enacts the legislation, and then if necessary the Supreme Court identifies any subtleties that might need amending."""")  There is no such process.  The Supreme Court only gets involved in a small fraction of cases which individual parties have pursued through a trial and appeal.  It's expensive for them, lengthy, and far from normal.  If the Supreme Court does decide to take on such a case, it does not then 'identify any subtleties that need amending.'  If it finds that certain sections of legislation violated the Charter, it declares those sections to be constitutionally invalid.  In some cases, it has allowed a 'grace period', to allow the government to amend it, as it did in the Carter decision.

0,"Hey Flyguy - First, my apologies.  My comments were on the snarky side which I don't really like to do.  Many of us rode the Alaska Gravy Train - high incomes, low taxes, and increasing property values.  And I completely agree that times here are likely to get quite rocky, and housing will crash just like in the 80's.  But your named taxes as the main reason for your move (inferring that if they weren't so high you'd stay regardless of the coming crash and property devaluation).  That makes no sense to me,  so I challenge you again to pencil it out.  Show me how much less your collective new state's taxes (property + income + sales) will be than your current 9K.  Factor in the loss of PFD and the cost of moving.  As I said, I suspect you're taking advantage of responsible saving and significant home equity to relocate to a place where a buck goes farther.  I don't blame you; I just challenge the degree to which your Alaska tax burden drives that.

One of the things that most immigrants do, sometimes even before they learn our language, is """"get a better job or another job, live cheap, stick together as a family...""""  Historically true in B.C.  Chinese and Japanese worked jobs that whites didn't want to do. [See TFWs].  When the 1858 gold rush moved up the Fraser, Chinese worked gravel bars supposedly """"picked clean""""--and prospered. Some BC 20th century stats:  By 1919, Japanese held 3,267 fishing licenses—nearly half the total number issued that year. By 1924, Japanese controlled 39 percent of Fraser Valley berry acreage. By 1937, Asians held 91 percent of Vancouver’s greengrocer’s licenses, 53 percent of the cleaners and dyers’ licenses and 29 percent of the tailors’ licenses. Chinese had a virtual lock on the domestic work scene, work whites wouldn't lower themselves to do.  In some cases, it soon meant whites would have to work WITH and often FOR immigrants.

All 100 were offered a return visit, 10 said any time, 90 said, are you nuts. . This 10% is the problem, and there is absolutely no evidence that the other 90% are going to become raving addicts. In my experience the same 10% rotate around the drug smorgasbord. Reefer madness propaganda is a difficult myth to suppress. When opium was hidden in miracle cures in the 19th century there was drug dependency aplenty.

0,"I grew up in Oregon when the previous generations still believed in funding schools and colleges so the next generations could become more educated than the last.  If Oregonians would actually step up and fund Public education at the levels prior to Measure 5 we would attract and retain more highly educated individuals in education from K-12 and into Higher Educations.  Unfortunately, Oregon has fallen to 46th for High School graduation in our nation due to reduced school funding; Oregon once had some of the top schools in the nation because we believed in funding education separately from the General Fund.  Once we start funding education to the levels where we can retain great teachers in Math, Sciences, Language Arts, Literature, Vocational Arts, Genera Arts, etc., we will begin the climb back to the top in education nationally.  Look around the world and see the many countries surpassing the US in education, it's because they know the value of funding education.

By the time its all done the average household will have nothing left. It appears that PFD's will continue to be offered at a reduced rate, this article suggests a minimum of $25.00 State Tax so everyone contributes, then it states that the 15% will be levied against taxable income but also states PFD's could be taxed as well, if that part is true, are we double dipping on PFD income since PFD's are considered part of taxable income. It is concerning that there are huge attempts being considered to TAX our way out of fiscal trouble rather than make HONEST attempts at working together to restore state income from our Natural Resource's, all that is happening now is no one can agree on what is right for the industry thus nothing gets accomplished so the next best thing is lets levy taxes.

0,"Not a word about Tom Watt.  I played for Tom at the University of Toronto. We won three CIAU championships over 5 years and defeated Clare Drake teams three times in national playoffs.  Although Clare Drake is mentioned and given credit for innovation, Tom was far more progressive than Drake and had a successful career coaching in the NHL. He won coach of the year in 1984 in Winnipeg.  Clare Drake? Dismal failure in the pros. Tom introduced many training regimens and playing strategies from international hockey into Canadian college hockey and it was Tom who influenced Drake and Dave King not the other way around. His approach eventually made it into junior and then the pros.  Mike Keenan? Played for Tom Watt. Sadly this 'journalist' didn't do his homework. Shame!!

Drinking ? People tend to say what they think others want to hear. I did not say that inmates should be forced into rehab. The savvy ones know it looks good if they attend classes, get their GED, or """"find"""" God.

No responsibility taken for their actions, sober or high. Slow learners but eventually they might learn. Rehab needs to be available for those who want it. No matter what you or I say, the fact is, most inmates are going to back out on the street.

For one, it is a postage-stamp sized country with pritnear half the population in a single metropolitan area.  They are culturally, ethnically, and linguistically quite homogeneous, compared to us, and able to control their borders much better than we can.   Basically, their system is tailored to a medium-sized city and its surrounding countryside, filled with disciplined Scandinavians still possessing a good ol' Protestant work ethic.  Could that be scaled up to cover a polyglot, heterogeneous society of 320 million, spanning a continent - especially with our Liberal Progressive Grievance Culture?  I've not seen any such convincing argument.  At any rate, our borders aren't sealed.  Why not turn in your U.S. passport, emigrate to Denmark, and see how they treat you?

It should not simply have been ignored. As it happened, the change could not have been more anticlimactic, as the CPI rate of inflation for February 2017 was the same as for the CPIH, but this won’t always the case.

So yea I agree with you, read Paul, and read other opinions too. On debt - yes Keynesian economics works great as Germany proved. Borrow money, create an army, conquer other countries, take their stuff, then pay off your debt with it. That's how Keynesian economics works. Spending money you don't have to grow the economy without a plan is not Keynesian, it's stupidity. And finally - Obama borrowing a little less money each year than Bush is nothing to brag about.

Both Paglia and Kipniss have a a lot of empathy for people who were raped. But you can have empathy while also encouraging people to take a certain amount of responsibility in order to protect themselves. This comes with the territory of being alive. It does not make people into 'prey' and feminists would be shocked to learn that this is a state of being for men too.  Near the beginning the author states: 'In hazarding that men alone aren’t responsible for sexual assault, or what the book jacket dubs “mutually drunken sex,” Kipnis is..' An assaulted passed out drunk person is absolutely a rape victim. Mutually drunk hookups are just that, yet are increasingly treated as rape. Kipnis makes this distinction. The author's acrobatics in conflating these two things is incredibly dishonest sophistry, masquerading as self-evident moralizing.

Every business owner I know wants to grow their business. That requires more staff in almost every case. They can't hire more people if they haven't got the money to do it. In a high-tax situation (America has the highest corporate tax in the developed world), businesses curtail hiring based on how much of THEIR earned money they are allowed to keep. If they are able to keep more, they will expand their workforce to grow their business. If taxes increase, they will reduce their workforce in order to remain profitable.  What really gets me is that you don't understand that taxes don't belong to the government. Individuals and businesses earn the money, which the government claims a large percentage of as theirs. Government earns nothing of its own. It is all stolen from the actual earners ... whether individuals or companies.

0,"Yes, common sense, and conservatism's own platform of beliefs.  Business owners benefit vastly more from all of those public resources than wage earners - out of conservative's own mouths it's better to take risk (and reward) and own a business than work for someone else.  Public resources support owners much more by providing them with higher levels of excess discretionary income.  The guy who drives his car down the highway to his hourly job benefits far less from that highway than the owners of companies who ship goods over that highway, OR the owner of the business that same wage-earner works for, but giving the business owner access to a skilled labor force.  The biggest one conservatives get wrong is education - wealthy stockholders benefit far more from an educated work force in their country than the people within that work force themselves.

0,"At about the same time the above was happening the Hawaii Sugar Industry imported 50,000 Chinese, 200,000 Japanese and Okinawan Indentured Servants.    After Earning enough Money, the Chinese, Japanese and Okinawans bought Land at Hawaii from the Kingdom of Hawaii.   The Caucasian Governments  then passed more Anti Chinese Laws (that were also applied to Japanese and Okinawans), especially pertaining to Land Ownership at the U.S..  At California Republic the Chinese, Japanese and Okinwan Farms stretched from south of San Francisco to the U.S. Border with Mexico.  The Causasians looked at these former Deserts turned into productive Farms with intense Jealousy.  This resulted in the Cattlemen routinely murdering the Chinese, Japanese and Okinawan Farmers, as their Farms blocked the Cattle Drives and the Cattlemen refused to pay damages to the Farmers Crops, the Cattlemen bought those lands cheap after the Cattle Ranch Hands murdered the Chinese, Japanese and Okinawan Farmers.

Perfectly stated, and it cannot be stated often enough lest normalization occur. We saw normalization beginning to happen after Tuesday's somewhat normal-sounding speech before Congress. But then of course reality burst the bubble the very next day when cold water was dumped over us and we were once again reminded of that existential threat that truly threatens our democracy. I agree with MSW that Notre Dame was right to keep Trump far from the stage at their commencement ceremony because this presidency is not normal - it is indeed an aberration, and it would be wrong for any university that values truth as a virtue to validate it in any way.

1,"""""Trump says hacking did not affect U.S. election outcome""""  Two, no, three points.  One, the issue is whether or not Russia (versus the 400 lb boy) attempted to interfere in the last US election by getting access to private data and making it public. This, apparently, is true, as Mr Trump's denials are now mute. Two, there is no way that Mr Trump or anyone else can say that this interference was, or was not, effective. Three, by saying that 'hacking did not affect the election outcome' Mr Trump is communicating that he believes (with ample good reason) that the people he expects to be listening are fools.  I get the impression that Mr Trump was under the assumption that 'hacking' was some sort of technical wizardry akin to black magic, and as such could never be 'proven'. His age is a prime indicator. Hacking is dull, boring, and like much on the interwebs, has really low hit rates. And leaves lots of tracks.

0,"Every voter, everywhere, for every candidate, would be politically relevant and equal in every presidential election. Every vote would matter in the state counts and national count.  The bill would give a voice to the minority party voters for president in each state.  Now their votes are counted only for the presidential candidate they did not vote for. Now they don't matter to their candidate.  In 2012, 56,256,178 (44%) of the 128,954,498 voters had their vote diverted by the winner-take-all rule to a candidate they opposed (namely, their state’s first-place candidate).  And now votes, beyond the one needed to get the most votes in the state, for winning in a state, are wasted and don't matter to presidential candidates. 8 small western states, with less than a third of California’s population, provided Bush with a bigger margin (1,283,076) than California provided Kerry (1,235,659).

0,"While pontificating, it is also useful to acknowledge that MAD means nothing to an insane, drugged, or drunk President and since no one can stop the President from firing off the arsenal, disaster is imminent.  Nikita was good at bluster but not good at mass destruction.  A small number of massive hydrogen bombs, say 50-100 megatons, is far less destructive than the same net megatonage in 250 kiloton bombs delivered accurately to dispersed targets.  This is, of course, reflected in the US stockpile and in the heavy MIRVing of the missiles.  Of course, none of this matters, since the President can launch anything at any time and no one will stop him.  What 7000 nukes at his fingertips?  I suppose it would be fun to do it in one big bang.  2000 nukes for China, 2000 nukes for Russia, 50 for North Korea, 100 for Iran, 50 for Syria, 50 for Afghanistan, 100 for Pakistan, and save the rest for later fun.

0,"Supporting Russia and Assad to defeat the rebels in Syria is the only way to regain stability for that country. The big error that Trump is making is to make his support for Russia explicit as it undermines the United States' entire foreign policy for many years/decades. America's allies are put in an untenable position in Syria and Ukraine and I wouldn't be at all surprised to see allies checking out of American-led coalitions in those countries. Of course, The Donald will then claim that its allies aren't pulling their weight. Trump siding with Putin puts NATO as a whole at risk and invalidates all kinds of situations that the US finds itself in.

0,"The Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act would punish those states that have reduced their uninsured population through Medicaid expansion, while rewarding those that have not.  Hawaii's Medicaid expansion has contributed to reducing Hawaii's average  per capita health care cost so that it is one of the lowest in the nation.  At the same time, Hawaii is among the states with the highest rates of insurance coverage.  Studies show that health care insurance coverage has a very high correlation with community health.  In my opinion, most of the people who are in favor of cutting health care insurance have it now and would continue to have it.  They want others to do without it.

0,"Sorry to break it to the author of this piece as well as apparently the BC Liberals, but no amount of inequality reduction or new jobs will address the gross distortion in housing prices that have been allowed to occur.

But even with this income, which is high by Canadian standards, I can't compete  on an international playing field with foreign capital and so will never be able to afford a house. And if I can't afford a home, how is redistribution of my income through taxes and other programs somehow going to support those who are less fortunate than me?  There simply aren't jobs in the vast majority of the Canadian economy that can support  these housing prices so the vast majority of Canadians will continue to be locked out of some of Canada's prime job-creating metropolitan centres.

The Crown in each province manages resources on behalf of all the people.  To require consultation before the rights to resources are even leased out would give First Nations groups veto power which would mean any energy project would be strangled before it even got off the ground.  She needs to realize that the First Nations groups in the Athabasca area (Treaty 8) have benefitted enormously from oil development (and yes, there are ecological costs that need to be considered).  But putting this minority in charge of a resource that benefits all Albertans would be the surest way to kill the goose that laid the golden egg.

There was an excellent article by Ari Schulman in the Wall Street Journal in November, 2013 about the phenomenon of the lone wolf mass killer and how to stop them. The gist of it is that these people perceive themselves as victims with grievances to share, and the kind of sensationalist coverage (typical of the 24-hour news beast) that follows an event like this helps create more of them.

Clearly, efforts (in the form of mixed messages from various persons associated with the Trump Administration) have been afoot over the past week or so to divide Canada from Mexico as a prelude to confronting Mexico and  Canada separately with harsh NAFTA related demands.  Clearly, some Canadian circles welcome the fact that Canada seems to be viewed within circles around Trump apart from Mexico in the NAFTA context.  Canada has different interests to those of Mexico but we have a common interest to ensure that NAFTA negotiations are conducted in a reasonable and rational fashion and not through bullying or threats.  C  Canada should therefore now suggest that meetings with Trump be delayed to give an opportunity to re-establish the basis for triparty NAFTA discussions to proceed from the onset.

A precious daughter could bleed to death overnight without a parent being aware she underwent major surgery. A young son may commit suicide because he is unable to help the young girl.

This predator control rule also prohibits:  1) taking of sow with cubs 2) taking brown bears with bait, snares or traps 3) taking wolves during denning/pupping time 4) taking bears on same day airborne.

As I have repeatedly said  I don't care what two or more consenting adults want to do. That is what it means to live in a free society.  The question is whether we should call what is manifestly not a marriage, a marriage.  The question is whether five unaccountable and unelected justices should have taken it upon themselves to upend the institution of marriage, redefine it to include gays and then impose that definition on the nation. The question is what is the proper use of our sexuality and should any attraction be considered a marriage if the person wants?  Good grief!

This theory was tested and found to be true in the UK when they raised marginal rates in 2010 and dropped them again in 2013. CRA stats show that 65% of tax revenues are paid by the top 10% income earners, so suffice it to say they pay more than their fair share...In addition to paying taxes, this group is much more likely to donate to worthy community causes and spend much more on discretionary items that help boost our economy..yet some how the government justifies targeting this group. Does not make sense and is simply unfair. However...targeting a small group that satisfies the masses buys votes!!!

0,"I think there is a big difference between purposefully leveraging your home and not being a hurry to pay the mortgage off.  While it is generally prudent to pay off debt in a short a period of time possible - there needs to be a balance with investment opportunities.  The point of the article is simply that when you can invest in low or moderately risked securities and earn a higher return than your interest costs it probably doesn't make sense to aggressively pay down the mortgage.  Whether one choose to invest via an advisor or what they invest in is another matter.  But using the example in the article of bank stocks or other common blue chip stocks it is pretty easy to meet or exceed your interest costs just from the first year dividend.  Add in dividend (and capital growth) and over the life span of your mortgage the spread will increase.

The PFD was conceived as a means to distribute this collective benefit individually through payments.    An accrued interest is a right you acquire over time.   There is no """"right"""" to a dividend that was created simply because it has been paid over a long period of time.     It's a gift, not an entitlement.   If the citizens of Alaska wanted to create a """"right"""" to it, then you are correct, we could do so through an initiative.   But presently, it's a annual """"gift"""" as allowed by law.

The commodification of housing over the years in metro Vancouver has seen entire complexes presold overseas for investment units, or second homes.  Some cities, like Richmond, have a very high percentage of it's units sold and vacant, estimated to be almost 50% in the downtown core.  Areas of Vancouver near transit hubs, like Marine and Cambie, are estimated to be 25% sold and vacant.  Tens of thousands of vacant housing units.  Do we just continue to build - and sell overseas or for speculation?  Are we building homes or safety deposit boxes or sporadically occupied second or third vacation homes?  Trying to predict immigration and settlement patterns is only a small part of the equation - we need the bigger conversation on housing commodification and demand via money generated offshore.

White supremacists used to be a term used for skin head Nazis, Aryan Nation, and the Klan - the kind of people who carried torches at Charlottesville - the fringe of the most racist people in America.  The idea that Trump and most of those who voted for him are all white supremacists is either ridiculous or a complete redefinition of the term.  The NFL is not a conspiracy to kill black men.   Black men dominate its ranks because they have the skills and abilities to play the game well.  And they are most dominant in the most athletic positions - cornerback, wide receiver, and running back.  They also dominate basketball and track and field for the same reasons, but nobody is suggesting that this is some sort of conspiracy.  The NFL could be doing more to make the game safer for players, but the foot dragging has much more to do with money than with race.

According to most economists, full employment (when effectively all job searchers can find a job quickly) occurs at about 3%. At 2% therefore, Canada would have a labour shortage, causing wages to rise. An unemployment rate of about 2% is what we as a country should be aiming for. Until we have reached that target, the government should not be doing anything tending to increase the size of the work force.  As far as """"can't find the skills they need"""", that's usually a matter of """"we're not willing to pay enough to attract the skills we need"""", often coupled with """"we want somebody with enough experience that he can get up to full speed the first day on the job"""".

Now that his side lost that decisive battle, they cannot accept defeat.  Even with Soros, the mainstream media, and much more money, Hillary lost to Trump.  There aren't competing truths here.  Bernstein's side lost and the truth that America is a center-right country is something they refuse to acknowledge.

Thanks to the Patriot Act and other anti-terrorism laws passed after 9-11, there are not as many protections, or checks and balances to rely upon as the writer believes.  We will soon see if the return to Bush era economic policies create economic boom or an economic collapse as they did during the Bush presidency.  My guess is that history will repeat itself.  Virginia and the rest of the poor in the lower 48 may be in for a bumpy ride.

0,"Alexandra, The question of engagement that you raise is a god one, for it affects the church at every level.  When we look at the early church, we see a level of engagement that is seemingly unthinkable today.  There are parishes in the church that are still very much alive, and vibrant.  I love that.  But I can't help but get the sense that such places are more and more becoming the aberration rather than the norm.  I'm sure there are tons of factors at play in all of this, but at the end of the day, the church leadership's handling of the scandal doesn't help.  When this commission was formed there was a wave of hope that ran through the church.  That's important to recognize, as it reflects the hearts of so many who still want to believe in the church.  By essentially sidetracking the commission, I think Francis has confirmed the fears of so many, while enabling so many of these clericalist priests to do their thing.  It all seems to perpetuate a cycle...

Another 8% to the EU.  China is only 4%.  Japan 2%.  South Korea and Hong Kong, barely 1% combined.  And Mayalsia and Vietnam, specifically highlighted in the article, don't even make the list.  The TPP may be a fine initiative, but the idea that it could prove to be a substitute for NAFTA or even a partial offset for NAFTA is simply misinformed.  Rather than pivoting to Asia, the Canadian government should be working at the congressional and state level and with major corporations to shore up and mobilize US domestic support for NAFTA (there is lots).  Trump would happily stick it to Canadians but he will listen to the voices of his own people, if they are loud enough.

The point is, everyone is in a tizzy about school shootings. This is more and more being used as an argument for more and more guns. School shootings are indeed something we should pay attention to, but they are actually extremely rare events. More people die from falling coconuts, mosquitos, choking, tripping, champagne corks, and yes, even cows, than from school shootings each year.  I think back of the envelope comparisons to provide perspective can be valuable to gauge how severe a problem actually is. That's all I'm doing here.

But during the 30's the likes of Neville Chamerlain, Charles Lindbergh, Walter Guinness, Henry Ford, Hermann Schwinn, Maurice Papon, Sir Oswald Mosley, all stalwarts of the political right, were open admirers of and sympathizers with Hitler and Mussolini.  Many of them readily identified themselves as 'fascists.'  I'm sure you can come up with a list of Communists/Socialists from the same period who openly sympathized with Stalin (or if on the outs with his regime, Trotsky).  My point is, again, that they were not the same, and as political movements were as inimical to each other as the Union and the Confederacy.  The """"reds""""/""""leftists"""" were one side, the """"fascists""""/""""rightists"""", the other.  Believe me, I'm not taking sides.  Stalin slaughtered Muslims in Crimea and Chechnya.

As more people migrate to Eugene and compete for the limited housing stock, housing prices and rents should increase unless the supply also increases to keep pace.

Lawyers measure income by the hour invested and many I expect adhere to the haste makes waste (of their earnings) mantra.

It does not matter if Mr. Adler or Mrs. Wente consider Mr. Khadr a """"real"""" or surreal Canadian - he was a legal citizen, and several successive Canadian governments have violated his legal rights. Had those governments not committed these mistakes - driven by notions quite similar to those of Mr. Adler, it would seem - then this whole problem could have been avoided.

0,"Headline: """"Trump's environmental rollbacks lack 'moral compass,' Catholics say Planet, people take back seat to business since election.""""  The """"moral compass"""" is jobs. N""""C""""R seemed to be dozing during the Obama Administration, in which the recovery from the 2008 downturn was exceedingly sluggish, and annual growth was mediocre. That translates into far fewer jobs created than might have been, stagnant wages, and fewer opportunities, particularly for those in historically disadvantaged situations, such as young people and racial minorities.  Heard on NPR this morning, from a woman in coal country who voted for Trump: """"We just wanted to have someone there who wasn't our enemy.""""

0,"When I was a child growing up in Montreal, my parents would take my brothers, sisters and I to visit reserves.  We would stop and mingle with the people.  When I was in my early twenties and going to university, one classmate was a Mohawk.  We became good friends.  I ended up living with him and his family on a reserve in Ontario for two years.  It was a wonderful experience, because it taught me so much about the First Nations. I then went to live in China where I taught for twenty years. Having experienced life in another culture, I was able to adapt to life in the Middle Kingdom. Twenty years later, when I returned to Canada, a different Canada than the one I had left, I moved to an area where there are at least 12 reserves.  I have come full circle, and still my love of the First Nations has not changed. What has changed is my attitude towards white Canadians who have made no attempt to befriend and to experience first hand what it's like to know the people of the First Nations.

Trump's quixotic threats against North Korea on the basis of empty threats made by its leader are equally preposterous.

The general inmate populations all live in """"gun-free zones"""" do they not?

Yet, especially if you were born female, would you have regarded living during such times and places as a haven from rape, robbery and other assorted random violence?  I for one do not regard times and places where individual safety can only be had by the wealthy elite or the strong as especially safe or desirable.

And soon after, the Constitution was the newly independent America's further declaration of independence from governance BY parent God?

Unlike the King of England, Children of Israel, ancient African tribes, Roman emperors, nations of Islam, etc., we Americans ceased to be governed by God's laws.  Yup.

So, where the Constitution GUARANTEES citizens the right to bear arms, that GUARANTEE is not a right from God, but rather, an INALIENABLE RIGHT from man.  A binding contract is a contract.

Seriously, if Soh had made this argument 50 years ago and we looked at how few female doctors there were back then, we'd be drawing the conclusion that women aren't doctors because they don't naturally enjoy medicine, which is obviously false based on the fact they are currently more than half of medical students.

Prior to that Britain & France should have kept the fascists out of the Saar, the Ruhr, and Austria.  Britannia ruled the waves then and she had a great empire;  French tanks and planes were superior to the German's.  What the Allies lacked was will.  SK, Japan, Australia, and the US face an existential threat from Kim which is much greater than any country faced from the European fascists in 1938. The Allies today have a formidable military alliance which should be used to prevent Kim from destroying them.  Once Kim has the capability to hit the Allies with thermonuclear ICBMs he could cause much more horrific damage than if the Allies disarm him now.  Hitler invaded Poland on 1.9.39 after appeasement failed.  Trump must stop the fascist NKs & Iranians to prevent a terrible Allied catastrophe.

Just when the officialdom was racing out its """"lone wolf"""" scenario to allege as usual that no Muslims or vestiges of Islam were involved in this attack, low and behold the man had """"associates"""". Not just a few but scattered around the country and quite possibly in Europe and the Middle East. Getting harder and harder to keep up the pretense that Islam is not very much a worrisome doctrine, especially when it is accorded such prominence in Western democracies and represents world-wide the major force perpetrating single and multiple deadly attacks killing thousands of innocents yearly not to mention the tens of thousands maimed or severely injured. No more PC interpretations of Islam please. Only the facts and only decisions made in the interest of citizens who are not trying to kill others for ideological or hatred reasons. Immigration from Islamic countries must be curtailed unless assimilation is more then just rhetoric.

0,"As far as the credit for low-income renters goes, I think it’s important to remember that if a couple has adjusted gross income over $30,000, they don’t qualify at all.  Note that a renter with social security and non-taxable pension income of over $30,000 could qualify, however.  The credit is $50 per exemption, so a qualifying family of four would get $200, which comes nowhere near the amount of GET in rent, even at $1,000/month.  A retired couple (over age 65) bringing in social security and pension income of $50,000 or more could also get a credit of $200.

That part of the passage is translated """"if she is getting along in years""""  The footnote explains that there was a lot of hostility toward Christians in Corinth at the time of that book's writing and some hesitated to marry at all.  There was also a possible alternate translation that  it may have been addressed to fathers who were reluctant to let their daughters marry, but should maybe reconsider if they were """"getting along in years"""".   No, no magic age.  But young women probably were married by late teens and considered past their prime for marriage if they made it into their 20s still virgins at home.  That was true right here in our country up through the early 20th century

Some of us oppose it because it was born in lies, sold to the public in a dishonest media blitz paid for with our own taxes showing luxurious and comfortable cars, only to replaced by seatless plastic boxes.  The route was stolen from the weary commuters it was promised to serve and now runs between an developers new sprawl and the luxury tourist mall.  The promised affordable TOD is turning out to be luxury condos and boutique hotels for wealthy visitors, and it is paid for with a regressive tax on struggling families clothing, rent, food, and medicine.

And many people DID help the ex-slaves to find a place to live.  A woman being forced to have a child against her will is a woman being forced into slavery. She has a child, which she did not want, on her hands for 18+ years.  This is not a good situation for the either the woman nor her child.  I DO CARE about the child that is born and I DO CARE ABOUT THE CHILD'S MOTHER.  You apparently don't care.  You only see the mother as a walking incubator.  That's all you PRO-BIRTH folks are about.

Rather than protest the atom bombs that stopped Japan's murder of tens of millions, Ms. Nakamura should protest the samurai swords which prompted the atom bombs.  It is estimated that the atom bombs killed perhaps 300,000 Japanese while Japanese murdered two million innocent people with samurai swords.  Why does Ms. Nakamura protest only the American weapons which stopped the war while not protesting the Japanese weapons which advanced the war?  I read no mention of the many victims of Japanese belligerence that prompted this fearful and deserved retribution.  Had the Japanese not casually beheaded people, turned women into sex slaves, speared babies on bayonets for sport, vivisected hostages, used hostages to test anti-personnel bombs and WMDs, and cooked and ate people, then, surely, there would have been no moral reason to atom bomb Japan.

Given those parameters, this is not about """"a bunch of creaky old men sitting around a basement drinking beer and talking nonsense.""""  I only wish that were true.  The man accused of killing a woman with his car (James Fields) is 20, Milo Yiannopoulos is 32, and Richard Spencer is 39. Jason Kessler, who organized Saturday's rally, does not appear to be old either.  Although to be honest, he doesn't look especially young.   Look at the photo of the (tiki) torch wielding villagers on the University of Virginia campus last weekend.  They, in total, don't appear to be old either.  This not about the past, it's about our present and it might well determine our future.  I for one want nothing these racist groups are offering.  It's time to stop making excuses for them.

0,"I doubt this trial will have the lasting affect the author wishes. More likely it will have little or no impact in the long run. It could even have an opposite affect. The problem here is that this is not a typical sexual assault case.  From what I read most cases are reported soon after the fact, within days. Assailants are quickly identified and (hopefully) brought to justice. There is forensic evidence and signs of trauma. This case has none of that.  This jury has the conventional task of choosing who to believe. Not easily done when both parties appear believable. It would be a travesty if a guilty person got off in a sexual assault trial but it would be an equal or greater travesty if an innocent person was found guilty. Therefore there must be a burden of proof to support a conviction. I see none.  If the author believes the victim's testimony should take precedence over that of the accused then she is asking that courts deliver vengeance not justice.

0,"Maybe your expectations are too high of police training in this country. I challenge you to attend the Citizen's Police Academy here in Honolulu. Judge Steven Levinson did, has a new appreciation of how our officers are trained. As a commissioner, will understand the process and investment the city and county makes for the training of each officer. You never will get rid of corrupt cops, a the job that corrupts people, especially when it involves power over another. All you can do is vet them, train them, supervise them, and hope they make the right choice in their career. Problem with STL, black people have a hard time getting past the vetting system. Agree that they need more black officers policing their communities, better understanding of their cultural differences, but if cannot get past the vetting system, I wouldn't want to lower the standards. Miami-Dade County did in the 80's( increase Hispanic officers on force) and they got Murder for Hire cops working for drug lords.

So if Quebec sees the women Muslim garbs as self subjugation on a gender-inequal religion, can they enforce equality by banning the use of those garbs... Definitely a Supreme Court question...

Most Protestant ministers were married for centuries---so being married is NOT contributing to the decrease in main-line Christian churches.

Our bishops could take note of that.  You stated there are larger numbers in graduate[Catholic] seminaries.

Notice the mismatch between properties on a given street.  I see modest houses that look like they were there since the 1960's.  Those are the original owners.

Within a hundred miles of Toronto, prices inflated sky-high due to a combination of low interest rates, bad past mortgage policies, and a dose of overseas money to boot.  3. A scattering of cities with house prices that are actually reasonable, reflecting historical norms and local annual incomes, such as Windsor and Halifax.

You don't mention higher Meth sentences that exist for the same reason but affect whites and Hispanics.  Why not?  Don't you want justice for all?  The Congressional Record shows in 1986, when the strict, federal anti-crack legislation was first being debated, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC)deeply concerned about the degree to which crack was decimating black communities across the United States—strongly supported the legislation and actually pressed for even harsher penalties. A few years earlier, CBC members pushed Pres. Reagan to create the Office of National Drug Control Policy.  It should  be noted that the vast majority of cocaine arrests in the U.S. are made at the state-not the federal—level, where sentencing disparities between cases involving crack and powder cocaine generally have never existed.

Neither Saturday Market nor Lane County Farmers Market can remotely meet these criteria all other corporations are held accountable to. By fiat local governments have exempted them, and grant “an exclusive monopoly” that makes an absolute mockery of our laws and rights of citizens. These monopolies openly discriminate against 98% of our local small business community. They have banned equal access under the law, equal rights, and EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. Only those deemed worthy by liberal economic bigots are allowed access to this PUBLIC LAND. Only when all of our community are welcomed will we have a community marketplace. Until then we have a social pig sty full of social pigs wallowing in their own vile *&^% and promoted to our community through Orwellian criminal fraud. These are the facts that are confusing you, Junior.

0,"""""lifelong technical and skills training"""" for what? Automation is creaming off the higher paying jobs in an effort to reduce costs for business owners. For people at the lower end it means that they are left with decreasing standards of living. But experts are predicting ever highly skilled jobs will be disappearing soon, and quickly, as algorithms are developed to deal with things like medicine, engineering and the law.  The industrial revolution caused tremendous upheaval until workers demanded, and after a long and bloody fight, won better pay and working conditions.  Cutesy stories about displaced buggy whip makers just gloss over the problem.  Besides, who wants to be constantly training for jobs that disappear as soon as you get your qualifications? That treadmill would exhaust Sisyphus.

Oddly enough, the categorical lumping together of persons as L G B T has occurred in about every paragraph of the article 1 to 2 times. Thus, a continual categorical indexing of people with same gender attraction. And, hence, it's continually categorizing people.  Agreed, on one aspect, the Church should be more attentive. And in my view - not my internal subjective view, but an objective view from where and what I can see and even hear - the Church has and is concerned being quite attentive in the moral guiding and teaching authority of her flock. Which She expresses the attraction as a disorder, rather than lumping people together as L G B T.

Trump's negotiating strategy is always to put down a very strong, exaggerated marker at the start and then be surprisingly open to compromises as negotiations proceed.  Given this AND that Canada remains the leading trading partner with the US and with a trade balance not as one sided as are Mexico's and China's AND that no US businesses are not moving jobs here AND the Mulroney factor (equipped to deal with Trump like Trudeau never could) AND that Trump will be too busy with Mexico and China to want to take on Canada, the chances are good the Trump presidency will be fine for Canada.  Increased US economic growth should profit us, albeit not most other countries.  Only Trudeau's arrogance and stubbornness can mess this up (e.g. if asked a Q in English by DJT, Justin must answer in English).

0,"NATO was formed after WW2 so that U.S. can have a formal and legalized control of those parts of Europe it freed from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy conquest. NATO turned these states into American conquered land. As such these states have become vassals of the U.S., give up control of their foreign and military policies, allow basing of U.S. forces in their land. In exchange, U.S. invest in them to restore prosperity. After the end of the USSR the U.S. betrayed promise given by Reagan/Bush 1 not to extend NATO by doing precisely that. Today, U.S. installs combat forces along Russia border to start a new Cold War.  It is understandable why western Europe had to do this, i.e. slave to America despite a bigger population. 7 decades long. This is the heavy price for being defeated ex-empires, now controlled by the bigger empire.  But Canada does not have to do this. We was not defeated in WW2. There are no U.S. forces here.  We have no military role in Europe. We must exit NATO.

Then Israel might actually try to get along with it's neighbors and the Palestinians instead of bombing and attacking them, because they can't afford to be the belligerent state they have become anymore.  Israel has attacked Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and has done nothing but oppress the Palestinians, take their land and build illegal settlements.   They borrowed a F-22 Raptor for testing and promptly used it to take out a Syrian air installation (The US decided not to sell them Raptors after that).

If we limit domestic credit, as in this case, AND also take strong measures to limit foreign buyers, the market will fall.  And that would be great for the nation.  Old homeowners will cry a little, but so what - so they get $700,000, instead of $1.1 million, on the East Vancouver house they bought for $95,000 in 1978.  Boo hoo!  Even the recent buyers will win, because they will simply default on their mortgages and walk away, only to buy the equivalent house back again for 35% less a while later.  I think a savings in the multi-100's of thousands range will be enough to induce a bankruptcy.

Thankfully, this doesn't count as a """"major atrocity"""" because the only death was the terrorist himself. (A death which was actually protested by some of the useful idiots of the left.)

Otherwise, perhaps it would be best for the blue states to seceed and leave the red states holding the public debt their wrongful ideology has wrongfully tried to impose upon free dignified honorable moral people, e.g.: their superiors in this country and society of ours. It's time to end this odious state of kakocracy and make the kakocrats all pay fully for it. It's time to restore and bolster our liberal democratic way of life.

Since my very tearful confession about my sinful life of sexual lust, I have remained chaste (and am open to marriage with the opposite sex). I know it was wrong, a sin and against God's Order to become physically intimate with someone of the same sex and that it is also wrong, a sin to become physically intimate with a person of the opposite sex outside of the marriage covenant - so that we complement one another physically and if it is God's Will bring forth life). Jesus gives those who are truly sorrowful the grace to avoid sin. His death and resurrection have freed us from our attachment to sin.

We used charts showing how much the price of nat gas had risen since the early 70's and projected that 30 years into the future to justify the cost.  But in 1983, the deregulated price of nat gas led production to meet demand, and the price has been coming down as fast as those solar panels came off the rooftops.

Ultimately, Ms. Goschen dismissed me for this purported insubordination and unsatisfactory conduct.  Fact: The Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings conducted a hearing in April and May of this year and despite an overwhelming preponderance of evidence proving the Port retaliated against me for reporting improper governmental action, Administrative Law Judge Lisa Dublin inexplicably ruled that the Port did not retaliate against me.

The results are staggering. CRS identified 83 overlapping federal welfare programs that together represented the single largest budget item in 2011—more than the nation spends on Social Security, Medicare, or national defense. The total amount spent on these 80-plus federal welfare programs amounts to roughly $1.03 trillion.""""  https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CRS%20Report%20-%20Welfare%20Spending%20The%20Largest%20Item%20In%20The%20Federal%20Budget.pdf

0,"There should be no kicker as long as Oregon can not pay her bills, without extended credit and the associated cost of interest.    The reason we can budget at all is the ability to spread irregular income based on economic health, over more than a single year.    What Oregon populist got was  promise to create debt payments when income didn't meet needs, matched by adding the cost of debt in years when we could be paying down the principle.  There's good reason I will not embrace populism, left or right.   Asking a short sited, ill informed, self centered public for answers to complex problems is only putting the decision of adults in the hands of often petulant voters .  The disconnect between voters and their representative is a real problem, the cause of well earned mistrust.   It's the political body that must use modern technology to listen and respond in meaningful ways to ALL voters who they represent.     Coffee shops and school auditoriums are not good enough.

0,"I can see both sides on this issue. If you defrock a priest, he will be free to roam the earth to abuse again. It would be like moving a priest from one end of the diocese to the other end. In both instances, kids could be in danger. On the other hand, I know of priests who were placed in treatment facilities where they still had access to children and teenagers. In one case, teenagers were employed at a facility where several of these priests were housed. They mostly served as wait staff and when called upon this, the Church did stop employing kids at the facility. In another case, also in suburban Philadelphia, patients were free to take walks away from the facility. They were found to walk across the street to the parking lot of a high school and also to a nearby shopping center. One wonders if the Church will ever take this issue seriously. I believe that the only real answer is to prosecute sexual predators and that means extending statute of limitations on child sex abuse.

""""He pointed a gun at me and demanded I give him all the money in the till"""" makes lack of consent quite clear.

So I am not surprised Elizabeth Warren is encouraging her own supporters to extend their support to Mazie, who is not a person who blows her own horn.  Here is Progressive Punch's ranking of US Senators. It has Warren as the 2nd and Mazie as the 3rd most liberal. Interestingly, it has Bernie Sanders as the 10th. Some rankings have Bernie as the MOST liberal. So different orgs use slightly different metrics. But Mazie is always ranked highly by progressive groups.  http://progressivepunch.org/scores.htm?house=senate

0,"Actually from Parliament.  The RCMP are arresting and detaining them under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and turning them over to Canada Immigration for processing.  There is a very good legal reason why refugee claimants (not asylum seekers which are a completely different class of persons) are not being charged in respect of their entry to Canada.  Under Article 31 of the 1951 Convention on Refugees Canada has undertaken to not prosecute refugee claimants for illegal entry into Canada including any issues of false documents or fraud relating to that entry.  Canada has enacted that exemption into our domestic law as required by the Convention in various iterations of our immigration legislation over the years. Currently that exemption is contained at s. 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.  So no charges because the law exempts refugees recognizing that refugees who are fleeing persecution are different from other migrants.

But let us not forget that the mother of multi-national trade deals, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), was formed in years following WW2.  The objective was to remove these two key industries from control by nationalistic politics by submitting them to multi-national regulations, and with that to reduce the risk of international industrial disputes from exploding into military wars. The  ECSC was the seed from which the EU emerged. One need only compare the first half to the second have of the 20th century in Europe to recognize that this multinational economic deal achieved what it was designed to achieve.  We should think about that before going back to championing economic nationalism.

It was this that Israeli PM Menachem Begin (a wanted terrorist during the British Manadate) found intolerable.  Israel has always feared Palestinian diplomacy far more than its violence.

Select individuals do know what he is capable of but obviously those who voted for him because he said one of his first acts would be to name a special prosecutor to go after Hillary Clinton are just learning.  Like any newly elected politician he will have a grace period to get himself organized. After that he becomes fair game for anyone contesting his failure to live up to expectations. We are seeing that with Trudeau now a year after his election. We can expect the same a year from now with Trump.

The NDP who would have gained the most, saw almost no increase in popular vote, and only gained 6 seats. The real reason for the Liberals drop was Trudeamania had worn off, but mostly it was his bad handling of the economy as Canada started to enter a recession and his policy of forced bilingualism  The niqab issue had almost no impact on the Conservatives.  The big losers were the NDP in Quebec after Tommy came out in support of it.

0,"Lots of people from Iran and China become Canadian citizens. Those countries might not recognize the Canadian citizenship granted to their own citizens, but that's hardly a problem for Canada.  I think the only situations that could be problematic arise where countries don't grant citizenship to children born in those countries to naturalized citizens of other countries who can't """"pass on"""" their new nationality to their offspring, assuming of course that the parents' countries of origin won't confer status either. This would have the effect of creating stateless children, but that would be something thoughtful parents should consider. Nothing forces naturalized Canadian citizens to reside permanently in Canada. They won't lose their citizenship if they don't do so, however the nationality of any children they might have outside of Canada could in rare circumstances become trickier were Canada to align its dual citizenship regime with prevailing standards.

I disagree if  they mean the former... and I agree  if they mean the latter.   But as other comments  have here pointed out, much of what we call great literature is a result of self abjection.  I mean, Franz Kafka was a giant cockroach in Metamorphosis.  Truth is, all of humanity's navel gazing in this vast universe of ours, where we have just discovered a solar system with several inhabitable planets, is small,  insignificant and trivial; shallow and superficial if you will.

These machines which can travel up to 50 kph are dangerous to pedal bikes, pedestrians and  cars turning legally across the bike lanes which presume the approaching bike is travelling at a normal pace and they have enough time to make the legal right turn.

The Pope should never have allowed it to be on the agenda especially as it had been reaffirmed by one of his recent predecessors. Any Catholic who is divorced and remarried is deceiving himself if he thinks he is not committing adultery and thinks that adultery isn't a mortal sin. The 'settled' teaching going back to Apostolic times (1 Cor 11:27) is that one should not receive the Eucharist unworthily. The Church has consistently taught that this means not being in a state of grace or to put it another way in a state of mortal sin. Any Catholic who values his Faith would know this. If he doesn't then it is doubtful that he would even care whether he was in a state of sin or not. My standard for determining settled doctrine is what has been consistently taught by popes and councils down the centuries.

If more revenue is needed at that point, a  sales tax on no-essentials (like food, and WIC or TANF, or other assistance) is the best idea. Seniors who are exempt, and those on assistance  will not  have to pay sales tax on their food or pharmaceutical items. No sense kicking anyone while they are down. Look at the crazy amount  of  taxes in Seattle for  a hotel. Astronomical. Do we still pay it? Yep. And in the last two years, hotels in Tukwila and SeaTac have added an additional flat tax of $2 per room, per night. Do we still pay that? Yup. Tourists who come  to Alaska are not going to gripe about an extra $2 per day. Seriously. Something we will have to work out will be to make sure schools are exempt and a few  other groups as well.

I contacted Porsche and indicated that the problem is potentially dangerous, depending on where the failure occurs in traffic.  I informed them that the design and part are below industry standard, considering that this vehicle is priced and described as a premium product.  I purchased the part and replaced it myself.  The problem is not the socket clip letting go of the transmission ball mount connection. But rather a fracture of the solid cable plunger itself inside the cable housing about six inches from the transmission hookup.  I sent detailed pictures to Porsche for referral to their technical department. They sent me a $500 voucher (the retail cost of the part) and told me what a valued customer I am. Yet they avoid sending out a directive to upgrade the part in those cars affected..  This is very poor form by Porsche.  Inform the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

0,"As for the senior citizen exemption on property tax bills, the state lays out some fairly simple rules for that. Over 61 years of age, annual income of less than $40,000 per year, which in Kitsap county puts a household of two in the 57% income bracket, and that property must be the primary residence. There are additional criteria for people with disabilities. Mountain view and waterfront in the 57th percentile shows a pretty well off couple that the state determines can afford to pay their property taxes.  There is also no precedent for using federal taxes to fund state schools based on number of children on income tax returns. Federal school funding is generally dispersed via the Department of Education grant system, leaving states to fund their own schools independently. Not the greatest system, but we have bigger problems with the federal government than that currently.

Instead I was so angry at everyone and I could not stop my anger. I tried that without success for couple of months and I got so desperate. One day I decided that I will just have to sit with all my anger and told God that I am, the way I am, is his problem and He has to fix me. I do not know how long I sat there being so stubborn, when I got out of my prayer; my heart was filled with the most profound peace that I never knew existed.  So I know by this mystical experience of God's peace that His peace is anything that we know what peace is.  After then, I never try to be like an angel when I pray. :-)

Canada is too small an economy to be able to produce goods for daily life at a cost that would allow Canadians to maintain a standard of life comparable to that of other developed countries.  But, there is a case to be made for intelligent protection of new industries and enterprises that in the laissez-faire that the Americans like (heavily loaded in their favour) cannot thrive. Sovereignty also means we must control some key sectors eg. banking, communications, etc. which doesn't exclude some limited level of external participation in these sectors.  Agriculture is one of the most mismanaged sectors internationally. Bullies like the EU and the US want weaker countries to give up their ability to feed their own populations in the interest of the big agricorps. Canada plays a less than exemplary role in this: resisting the US and at the same time joining it in pushing others around. The dairy quota mess is on par with the taxi industry.

Trump is an idiot, but he did not murder an Ambassador and four servicemen to coverup arms sales.

Our constitution does not need to protect the p=speech we like; it needs to protect the disgusting speech we abhor.

The point of this comment thread is that insofar as one's low opinion of the protectors is based on their being anti-scientific it is wrong.  The protectors have stated clearly that they aren't against the science of the TMT.  I was surprised when I heard Kealoha Pisciotta make this point many months ago, but I've lost where I heard it.  I've provided a link to a Smithsonian magazine article that says the same thing, so I think this point is widely known and not some figment of my imagination.

Plus, many, many young people will have quit on the region/ failed to launch/ never start a family/ etc. loooooong before they see a dime, even if there was an inheritance. And if parents have more than one kid, then that wealth is split up. That doesn't help help these people make a life in a community that might have been home to their family for generations.  The fact is, the cost of living is high in places like Vancouver because of policy, not prosperity. Real estate markets in Canada - and in some areas in particular - are rife with interference and polices that blatantly favor longstanding owners. It's good politics to keep that party going because it's enriching just enough people in the near term, but it's god awful planning long-term and it's not sustainable.

It took me months to find the courage to come forward. The archbishop lied and spent five years and millions on demeaning legal efforts to throw every victims case out.  We all were emotionally devastated.  This betrayal was more than I could take. I have frequent severe panic attacks and night terrors so often that I am afraid to go to sleep.

Most people are perfectly capable of managing their own portfolio, but many of course choose not to because of a lack of interest or time.

When it's going to get serious is when Canada finds itself between a rock and a hard place when Canada has to side with China and not with the U.S.  in some military or security matter or the sale of American technology or the exposure of a spying ring. A matter such as one of those is inevitable,  the sale of Norstat being a precursor. Not related to the Chinese but a reward and apology to the Canadian terrorist is a stick in the eye of the U.S. to take the cheapest option.

But, buried deep in this story is a little stat that rings true, because it ...  1. flies in the face of conventional wisdom (that times are tough in the US, people are unhappy and restive as a result, and that is one big reason for Trump's rise.)  2. It comes from a major American for-profit corporation, not some academic think-tank.  3. It's based on sales.  Profitable companies don't make something people don't want or can't afford.  GM is cutting back on--what kind of car?  A SMALL car.  An inexpensive car.  A car that takes less gas to run. Huh?  The statement: """"U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM’s U.S. Cruze sales are down 18 per cent through November.""""  LOW gas prices hurt this car?  Sure: because enough people are earning enough money (for SUVs) that they just don't care about """"economizing.""""  Tough times, eh?  I believe GM.  Trump?  Silly stuff

In a good year, it seems wise to split income through dividends or invest retained earnings.  But with the new tax measures, there is little incentive to have a good year when that next dollar earned is subject to 54% tax with little possibility of deferral (RRSP yes, but these personal tax liabilities may grow as tax and spend Trudeau like governments may eventually need to raise marginal rates by the time you try to withdraw).  Moreover, Trudeau's daily platitude response to almost any question from the opposition (I.e. We are helping the middle class by asking the 1% to pay more) is inaccurate.  Many of these affected incorporated professionals  are 5% or 10%'ers, and in high cost cities like Toronto or Vancouver (huge base areas for the Liberals by the way) they are hardly rich.

Also, the Liberals shut down the Nanticoke coal fired generating station to which several layers of pollution control equipment had already been added. That move was to reduce """"greenhouse gases"""", but then they replaced that generating station with gas burning generation. They replaced one type of fossil  fuel (coal) with another type of fossil fuel (natural gas).   That story about the transmission system needing to be upgraded was because wind turbines and solar energy are so unstable and because they needed to extend the transmission system to connect with the wind turbines which are in remote areas.

It's magnitudes cheaper (don't just compare rent to mortgage cost - include property tax, property insurance, condo fees, repairs and maintenance) to rent and way cheaper and easier to move (no realtor commissions, legal fees, land transfer tax). Plus, a well-diversified portfolio (Canadian, US, International holdings)  has blown the doors off the housing market over almost any time frame.

Clinton's history is that of a corporatist, and she has a tendency to make deals that offer a short-term gain in some areas for a larger longer-term loss in others. The ACA is, in my opinion, an excellent example of this. It cements an already abusive set of corporations into the system such that it makes any serious advances much, much more difficult.  Clinton is also much more militaristic than I am comfortable with. I truly do think that her being President increases the odds that we'll have more war than we already do.

Here's what I think you are missing, bikes do not damage the road.  Roads are designed to handle 50K lbs trucks, a person on a bike that weighs up 300lbs isn't going to damage the road.  So the only thing that bikers should be taxed for is the real estate that bike lanes take up.  And since about 50% of the money for road construction and maintenance comes from the general fund it's safe to say that is being covered.  I think bikers are getting ripped off because they are paying for the maintenance of roads that car and trucks are damaging.  The only truely fair way to handle transportation taxes would be to move to 100% fuel based tax for maintenance costs.  Give everyone a refund on the portion of the state and federal taxes that are covering roads and instead raise fuel taxes to cover the difference.

She talks about how alcohol is a factor in cases of rape, but she doesn't delve into why except for """"silly wimminz, stop drinking so much because boys will be boys lol"""". The reality is, rapists prey on people who are incapacitated. The problem is with the rapist, not how much women have had to drink.  To suggest that women are to blame because they drank too much is to suggest that men obviously just couldn't help themselves because they're animals who are slaves to their hormones. Is that what we really think of men? Neanderthals who can't control themselves?

For the first time in her life, she had flamed out — spectacularly, given the expectations of others for her, and even more so on her own. Of 817 applicants, 551 of her peers had passed, most from law schools less prestigious than Yale. She kept this news hidden for the next thirty years. She never took the exam again, despite many opportunities. Her closest friends and associates were flabbergasted when she made the revelation in a single throwaway line in Living History.

0,"To the extent there is and has been voter frud – and there is little doubt of it; examples are well documented, including dead people voting in Chicago throughout much of the 20th century – the notion that it’s widespread and has threatened to alter outcomes falls on the paranoid side of the ledger. Which isn’t surprising. Much of Trumpism is built on paranoia and perceived boogiemen hiding at every turn, in the news media and within U.S. institutions.  But that doesn’t fall under the purview of federal review. Elections, like education, are state matters. Local efforts to prevent illegal voting are sufficient. The advent of a presidential witch hunt is as startling and childish an abuse of federal power as was the Obama-era IRS scrutiny of tax-exempt applications based on solely on the perceptions of group names.

When I was in my late twenties, I had the chance to live for a year on the Six Nations of the Grand River.  Because I respected the people, I was treated accordingly. One night while on the way to a dance off the Reserve, I asked the driver if only Indians would be there. He replied, """"You're an Indian, sort of.""""  Nice!  Canada's treatment of the First Nations sanctioned by the government under the aegis of Christian clergy unleashed a legacy of racial terror upon children of the First Nations.  Only when Canadians en mass come to terms with this blight upon our historical pass, will Canada attain its high destiny.  Drew Hayden Taylor's article is a reminder how far we have to go.

0,"Yes Caiside, man changes. Human inspired alterations, however, tend to be away from God; the definition of sin.  Think about how words have changed in meaning recently. """"Wicked"""" in Boston, became synonymous with """"good"""", for example. Change happens in a living language.  It's normal.  Latin is considered dead, because the meaning of the words have ceased to change.Therefore the words and meanings to a person attending the Mass 1000 years ago, are exactly the same as you will find in an Extraordinary Form Mass celebrated this Sunday at a parish near you! Isn't that neat? This fixed nature lends itself to a consistency which prevents abuse, allows Christian unity across the world (space) and time. It supercedes the natural laws of physics and has extricated us from Babel. The Church is comprised of the Church Militant, the Church Triumphant and the Church Suffering, so when we attend the EF, it is a Mass that is familiar and loved by Saints and Doctors of the entire Church.

Yet the census says  Canadians' income growth during the Harper decade was - despite a global collapse in 2008/9 - somewhat HIGHER than their income growth during the previous decade under Chretien and Martin.  For many months now, the Ontario premier and finance minister have been crowing about how wonderfully well Ontario has been doing economically under their Liberals.

If their liabilities become so underfunded as to collapse because of their investments and returns, so be it. Many municipal public pension funds are way underfunded as well, many are such a liability to the municipalities, as to strap them into going darn near bankrupt in economic downturns. Another recession like the last one would force many cities to either shed those liabilities totally, or severely reduce benefits, (which here PERA recipients won't accept), or raise taxes on the people to record levels that would virtually kill those cities.  PERA needs to face reality just like the private sector. GM and many huge pension funds are underfunded, they made forced cuts in benefits in the last recession. Since taxpayers have  no say in the investments or cuts at PERA, let PERA stand on it's own, no taxpayer liability if they fail.

I've had subscriptions to all 4 and would only consider the Globe now because the others are predictable and very much fit the annoying stereotypes of those political ideologies.

This budget is long on rhetoric but offers zero, but again if you have nothing left what can you do. Next up in the fall , tax increases, as they have no other choice.

There seems to be a distinction between scientific literates who reject Raju's pipe dreams, and literary intellectuals who are not equipped to verify his claims who want to fix something that isn't broken with what amounts to Lysenkoism.

And also the allegations by observers and pundits that Justin has very likely breeched federal law (Conflict of Interest Act) by accepting the trip on the helicopter.  Also being investigated by the ethics commissioner.  Rona the hypocrite, or Justin facing a charge by the RCMP and numerous ethical sanctions.  At any rate, good to see liberal posters all-of-a-sudden concerned about the ethical and lawful behavior of the PM.  I wonder why it took so long, no Trump tweets to parse ad-infinitum today?

Private schools tended to be religious ones, not of the Punahou variety.  Especially if you grew up in a working or middle class suburb, you could be proud of your school's achievements.  We had the best art and band programs. We had a wide range of sports.   In the post WWII era, many very blue collar families mixed with emerging white collar kids.   And many public schools were quite independent...much like today's charters.  Small districts had their own boards.   Tests were created inside the school, not imposed.  Most kids went to college.  One of the most popular aspirations:  to become a teacher.  It can happen again.

As for drug company practices they moved testing offshore to reduce exposure to legal claims and sent production to India and China to reduce production costs by 18 cents per 1000 pills. Oddly given that the offshore producers have a penchant to cheat the quality control systems, approving defective batches, you would think that the increase risk to insurers would cost these drug pushers more than the production savings. This brings up the point as to why does our government NOT require the labelling of all prescription bottles with the country of origin in which the drug was manufactured. It is not even shown on the pharmacist's master bottle.

Those factors may come into play to a small degree, but they are triggered by the thousand cuts of being on the road with many inconsiderate drivers.  By inconsiderate I don't mean speeders; I mean aggressive tailgating, blocking the passing lane, not accelerating fast enough from a light, driving recklessly in inclement weather, running reds,  changing lanes without a blind spot check etc etc.  There is no enforcement, instead there is a simple revenue grab by ticketing speeding. Of course people are rarely ticketed speeding where it is actually dangerous - it's almost always in 'entrapment' areas - i.e. where one can speed without really endangering anyone.   In fact, the drivers who in effect relieve congestion get punished.   Just my thoughts from 50 years of driving in Toronto everyday - no accidents.

Where those silly flashing lights highlight a crosswalk, there is no legal requirement for anyone to activate them in order to secure their right of way.

If there are no traffic control devices in place, then it is an uncontrolled intersection (first-come, first-served). If there happens to be a crosswalk, then a cyclist can proceed with the right of way if s/he rides at a normal walking speed.

Stafford is infamous for his in-depth studies and discoveries of what Bartolome de Las Casas actually said and did to protect indigenous people in New Spain (vs Church of Spain)  In addition Stafford's research and books on the *myth* of San Juan Diego - via Stanford Press - The Guadalupan Controversies. So, Doug has followed in Stafford's footsteps in terms of doing research necessary to address long standing *myths* and legends of the Catholic Church.  OTOH, their research has not really debunked but rather laid the groundwork to understand the context of the people of faith at that time and what the key meanings of these legends are.

The carnival barkers get rich, they get to vote for clownish politicians who accomplish nothing.  Now Trump and his Cabinet of deplorables wiil take the grifting and scamming to unimaginable heights.

We can not solve our fiscal problem with a  tax or any cuts or any combination. Most who are against the tax believe, and I am one of them, that no tax should be instituted as long as fixing the balance of the deficit is unattainable. IF they cut until a reasonable tax of some sort would balance the books they might get a much warmer response. But as long as taking $600 million out if the private economy still leaves a $1.9 billion deficit it is pointless.

0,"There was a very good report on future policing produced by experts from the UN in the mid 1990s, which was endorsed by President Mandela. Key findings, apart from getting rid of military titles, was a change in philosophy towards being more of a police service rather than a police force. But even more fundamental was reversing geography. Under the Nats nearly all new police stations were in white areas.   Just shutting down some of them and putting them in black areas would have made a huge difference, if it had happened. But no, once Mandela went, the government thought having a para-military force was what was needed, blue light convoys multiplied and police men and women refused to move to proposed stations in black areas. And now the military police forces (they have multiplied)  have also become the biggest spies and informers in the political sphere, while ignoring judges. Soon they will rule.

Think about the terror propagated with the dollars (in cash) that they received. Cash also isn't traceable; how convenient. Valerie Jarret, who was born in Iran, was probably the driving force, along with the total support of the former President. Even if Iran keeps their promises on nuclear development, after 10 years they can develop weapons. Plus we can't send in our own inspectors to military facilities. So do you trust Iran?

IS will either abandon the populated areas it controls, or they will suffer the same fate as Aleppo. One wild card in its hand is it's control over the dams on the Euphrates River. If IS went berserk, the destruction they could inflict would be on a nuclear scale.  3. Russia wants what it always wanted: a stable ally in the Middle East, and its naval base at Tartus. They would've intervened sooner in Syria, but the US and its NATO allies used conflict in Ukraine to keep Russia close to home.  4. Everybody forgets to consider the Kurds. They are likely to reach an accord with Assad for portions of northern Syria. This will infuriate Turkey.

I remember Reagan putting in place a plan to help the elderly with nursing home care that they had to repeal because it was paid for by the elderly themselves who were up in arms about being held responsible for their own benefit.  The lesson is that asking something of the taxpayer is one of the biggest mistakes a politician can make. The people who designed the ACA expected more people to do what this employer did with paying the penalty and push more consumers onto the marketplaces and increasing the number of healthy people in the risk pools.  They expected that over time health insurance would become an individual thing instead of employer based.  That would have helped the economy as a whole and US competitiveness on the world market where other countries charge for health coverage through taxes.

It's irrelevant that he 'caused great bodily injury' as he was defending himself from having great bodily injury or death, himself - which is the textbook definition for using deadly force - the jury unanimously agreed. I already explained, very clearly, how the defense of LOE and necessity allowed for him to posses the weapon. The lesser of evils doctrine dates back to Common Law, and dictates that one may commit one crime (evil #1) to prevent a more serious act from occuring (evil #2.) Evil in this case E1 = committing the offense of illegally possessing a weapon to prevent E2, E2 being a murder victim. More commonly/daily LOE defense = speeding on your way to the emergency room so your pregnant wife can deliver her baby. Exact same legal argument - different scale.

0,"The Republican platform, upon which Lincoln was elected included SPECIFICALLY, not to EXTEND slavery.  The firing on Ft, Sumpter caused Lincoln's military response.  It would have been interesting to see if Sumpter had NOT been fired on how Lincoln would have forced a military solution.  Washington DC and several state remaining IN the union still, legally had slavery. In fact, in 1862, the IRS began taxing slave sales IN those states to help fund the war. (DC had slavery, but no sales).  Upwards of 90000 free blacks fought for the Confederacy, starting in 1861, mostly militias.  Blacks were only allowed to serve in Union forces starting in late 1863, mostly to free white troops to fill fighting units. (Due to horrendous losses), This was also when the draft started, causing massive riots in NYC.   Time after time, speech after speech, Lincoln said the war was to """"preserve the union."""" the EP didn't free the slaves in those northern states.  John needs to read some more history!

0,"Being able to legally build a loft for sleeping (one can already build a loft that one isn't able to sleep in) is hardly the making of a slum. In fact, with our beautiful evening and night skies, many friends of mine have modified their homes so that they sleep in lofts under skylights. None of them would have done so if they hadn't found a way around the stairway problem.  Heck, my niece lives in a half-million dollar home that has a ladder to a loft that pre-dates current code. She would like to upgrade the ladder but isn't allowed to unless she converts it to a stairway, which just won't fit. There's nothing remotely slum-like about her home with a loft.  We probably agree that our building codes need to be upgraded and enforced. However, allowing people to use ladders to access sleeping quarters is where we may have to agree to disagree.

0,"It's not about who they are as a person. It's not even about the behavior that stems from their sin. It's really about forcing people to violate their closely held beliefs. We don't force Muslims who own restaurants to sell alcohol because that would be against their beliefs. But somehow it's all right to force Christians to not only remain silent about sexual immorality, but to approve and participate in it by providing symbols of a commitment to a wholly sinful lifestyle. The Bible says clear that when we have a conflict between the laws of man and the laws of God, we must obey God ... even if it means being hung upside down on a cross as Peter was. I'm sure there were people in his day who thought he should just accept society's way of doing things at that time and not be concerned with obeying God. In fact Acts 5 was exactly that circumstance. """"Believe anything you want, just do it our way"""". Peter & John replied """"We would rather obey God than man.""""

What this means is that, other things being equal, tax revenues can only increase by, in effect, raising tax rates, which is what the Morneau proposals will achieve.  However, there are two rules at play here that he has ignored. One is that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Another is that the tax system in Canada has probably already reached the point of diminishing marginal returns with 53% top income tax rates.  It's all as if Canada had tight border controls to keep its high earners and those with marketable credentials and high income aspirations (which is why they achieved excellence in their fields) from leaving the country. Decisions like that are not taken lightly, but they will have to be taken in response to draconian tax rates and measures.  Maybe JT will propose building a wall (to keep people in, not out) and asking DT to pay for it.

0,"It is unlikely that every politician subscribes to every aspect of their party's platform , and as is everyone's right will hold views that may be counter to them. However these vies are largely kept off the table, depending on the desires of the party. Harder can as they say, walk and chew gum at the same time. Holding a pro-life view doesn't translate into forcing the committee to subscribe to her views. If anything she would likely to be even more carefull considering the controversy , to make sure she walked a neutral line. The Liberals didn't need to do this, but by doing so continue to poke holes in their openness, diversity, and freedom card that they play often. One is reminded of a great line by Henry Ford when asked about the colours he was producing in the new age of the car. Ford replied you can have any colour you want , as long as it is black. With the Liberals, freedom is what we decide it is.

The result it that Obamacare is more popular than it was before the Republicans started their internal battle over repeal and replace. Two problems for the Republicans are: 1) They want their plan to provide a huge tax break for the wealthy to satisfy their supporters, and 2) They are letting ideology-- conservative and moderate or liberal ideology-- get in the way. Get rid of the tax break (put that into the budget and tax reform fight). Stop all the conservative vs liberal in the GOP and just focus on what works and right now that is Obamacare with a few changes-- it works well but for a few- according to many studies and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office analysis, the American Medical Association, insurance companies, and several Republican governors.

0,"Canada produces approx. 1.6% of the world's GHG emissions. If we theoretically reduce that to 0% (not possible in the foreseeable future), it will not slow or stop global warming. Taxes will not slow or stop global warming. That will simply penalize the businesses that now rely on oil in gas to produce products, with no viable alternative. Add in another 1 billion or more increase in the world's population in the next 100 years, and GHG emissions will continue to increase globally. Oil will be used for decades, possible centuries to come. Coal was the primary source of energy for centuries and it took 100 years to make the switch to oil and gas. That is the timeline we need to embrace for a switch to a carbon intensive economy to some sort of alternative energy source not yet invented - solar, nuclear, wind do not power transport trucks, ships, trains, planes, nor do they provide a substitute for the approx. 7000 products oil is used in.

Wedge issues like abortion are a side show. On the main, the federal judiciary is pro gay rights, no matter who is appointed, and pro-Roe with very few exceptions (including most GOP appointees). The parameters of Amendment XIV are pretty well established. First Amedment Law is the most in flux, although Affirmative Action still is a flash point for disagreement.

When a free and open society is under attack by those who take advantage of the freedom and openness in order to launch their attacks, what is the correct response of that society?  It is natural for members of the society to feel fear.  Who wants to be a victim of the next attack?  Further, it is natural for people to want their government, which is elected by those same people, to offer protection from further attacks.  But where do we go from there?  The course forward becomes especially delicate when the attacks appear to originate from an identifiable group.  How many of the group are involved? How many are sympathisers?  How many turn a blind eye?  The temptation is strong to visit retribution on the group with all the powers of the state and surrender some of our freedoms to keep us, a la the NSA in the USA.  before doing so, we all need to be sure of what ask for.

I can understand that the Canadian Government doesn't want to stress from the outset of negotiations that the Trump demands regarding NAFTA generally and Keystone, in particular, are outlandish.  It is simply good negotiating tactics for Canada not to be distracted by the opening bravado that a shady real estate developer might employ to soften up a potential opposite party at the prelude to negotiations over a deal.

Just like NFL players are allowed to play for pay while appealing suspensions . This clown gets paid big money to be part of a show called the NFL.  The league tells players what they can wear and how to act if they want to be part of the  show. Instead of appreciating the fans who pay him his millions he wants to give about 90 percent of them the middle finger . Many fans are putting their money where their mouths are by burning his jersey . When you go to a UAA or Aces game they ask men to remove their hats before the national anthem .

Know how these critters would have died if it weren't for our excellent marksmanship?  After 8-10 years the teeth of ungulates begin to wear out...can you imagine that-no crowns, dentures, no health insurance (I know, it's wild).  Eating becomes excruciatingly painful.  Then at some point these moose, caribou and sheep just cannot tolerate the pain, so they stop eating....getting weaker and emaciated by the day.  After a few weeks of this, stumbling around, bedding down on a hillside for days suffering, dying from malnutrition, a grizzly bear spots them.  The caribou see the grizzly bear.

I've seen the police map of crimes and have spoken to officers at community meetings. I've looked into other major metropolitan areas and the same is true.

Mysticism and revolution are two aspects of the same attempt to bring about radical change. No mystic can prevent himself from becoming a social critic, since in self-reflection he will discover the roots of a sick society.

They are extremely selfish and short-sighted, the result of democracy. Therefore the relationship between our PM and U.S. president is always adversarial, hardly in good terms. Why U.S. presidents have threaten invasion of Canada a few times and I ain't talking 1812.

0,"Big difference.  National Parks and Colorado State Parks use fees from recreation (fishing, hunting, entrance fees for hiking, etc.) to help to maintain the park, trails, etc. and pay the staff.  Certainly not a profit but user fees that make sense.  They are not opening up the parks for mining, drilling, etc. so they can make money above and beyond what they need.  I think Zinke and his staff are being short-sighted and pretending it is for conservation when in reality they are ideologically pro-drilling, etc.

I would encourage people to google ACES and inform themselves of what this means in terms of addiction, chronic illness, autoimmune diseases, and suicidality.

0,"The reality is that foster-care is not the perfect solution but it is better than putting kids in a state or privately run residential facility.  Not only because of costs but because of the inherent potential for abuse and neglect when you institutionalize.  It's also a nice road to prison/jail because you are raising kids in an institution.  The other side is kids staying with the families, which is actually preferable and costs less but many children are in foster-care because of their families, it is often not the fault of the child at all.  So adequately funding the foster care system makes sense.  Many kids actually thrive and get better when removed from abusive or neglectful environments and need the advocacy and protection because of their vulnerability.

Just as there are proponents for restructuring the PF, there are proponents of right sizing the state workforce and spending. While on the school board Kennedy supported deficit spending and increased property taxes and failed to hold the Comeau administration accountable for dismal graduation rates. The truth be told, she supported bonds over fiscal discipline. If we're going to solve the deficit, we need a balanced approach, not more spending and more taxes. Reinbold's view of the budget is no more extreme than Walker an Kennedy.

Why else would investors put up their money and take considerable risk? The producers and directors, I assume, are making casting decisions based on what they see as the best course to make money. And if that course at some point leads to changing the demographic profile of actors, then so be it. Private industry is not like some government sponsored social engineering exercise where investment and profit don't really matter. I have an idea. The critics should each put up $200,000 of their own money (not someone else's), convince 20 of their friends and family members to do the same and with a budget of $4.2 million dollars, come up with a script, hire a director and make sure the cast is perfectly balanced with respect to gender and ethnicity.

0,"Yes, the Eagles are 21st this year after 7 games, but they were 14th last year (Wentz's first as a starter) with basically the same OL. In other words, even though they are ranked lower this year, they have all worked together as a unit going into year 2 or more - I'm including Wentz. So they should know what their teammates are doing or going to do. If a QB is supposed to make the OL look better or worse, how come Wentz is having a better year but his OL isn't? I thought the QB was responsible for that according to your own statements. As for Siemian getting better or worse, I agree that he's looked worse the last 4 games after starting out well in the first 2. From what I've seen in the NFL, many players, QBs too, hit a 2nd year wall or make a 2nd year leap.

0,"Transparency is a key theme of the Liberal government, and it fulfilled a key election promise when it announced a parliamentary watchdog would be created as part of Bill C-22, which is currently before the House of Commons. However, a report by the non-partisan Library of Parliament says the proposed independent committee of MPs could be kept on a short leash, or even muzzled, by prime ministers. This contradicts Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who said recently that C-22 creates a committee that “will set its own agenda and report when it sees fit.”  ----  These Harper style Stasi tactics will surely enrage our brave posting liberal warriors.  After all, they went apoplectic when Harper tried tactics like this.  I surely have to believe that every single argument our brave liberal warriors put forth about Harper was not simply driven by partisanship and was for the good of Canada and Canadians, right?

0,"Millions of slaves and you come up with a just a few examples before the War.  This thread concerns the era c. 1861 -65 FYI.  Moreover, during this era many people, white & black, regarded as being criminal got hanged;  very, very few of them were black, partly because each black was worth the price of a good racehorse.  It requires just a smidgeon of common sense to see that blacks were, for the most part, well-treated because their owner's livelihood depended upon their good health.  Just as a horse could not work well if he were weak or sick neither could a black or a white -- e.g. indentured servants.  Yet again you ignore the fact that on plantations and large farms, blacks and whites grew up together.  Most white owners felt a sense of moral obligation as well to treat their slaves well and to teach them to read the Bible.

0,"The conclusion to your article comparing US gun laws and Canadian tobacco laws would be that Canada has been steadily working to lessen the harm (advertising, display, warnings rules) and America is working to increase it (reducing barriers to accessibility).  Lung cancer rates are a red herring. They are not related exclusively to cigarettes, and they are also trailing in their impact, and will typically go up in a longer lived population. Again we need to look at recent policy decisions.  This does not mean the profit virus does not infect Canada. But cigarettes aren't a good example of it at work. More recently you could have made a better moral equivalency argument about the export of Asbestos, but no more.  Aside: it will be interesting to see what the Cannabis lobby is able to achieve.

0,"Just to clarify my position on the issues discussed in this article:  centers in areas that CAN collect blood beyond local need have, in my mind, a moral responsibility to do so and to make it available outside the local system.  This provides a local cushion against unanticipated needs and allows complex patient care that is dependent on blood availability to proceed in areas that use more than they can collect and process.  If you travel to MD Anderson in Houston, or the Fred Hutchison Cancer Center in Seattle for tertiary care, you will be glad that blood centers share.  To those who object to blood centers charging for blood, please tell me how the Blood Bank of Alaska or anyone else can pay for testing, component manufacturing, storage, and distribution without charging for their output?  The fact that the raw material is freely given by our donors just keeps those charges lower.  Louis M Katz MD Chief Medical Officer America's Blood Centers

0,"Nice article. Gotta correct you on the pahoehoe vs a'a density. You are mostly correct. A'a  has a much higher viscosity than pahoehoe, due in part to it having a lower gas content. When it is flowing, it behaves like a very dry bread dough with shaggy floury lumps (the clinkers you referred to) solidifying and falling off the top or being pushed along the front of the flow. The resulting rock has fewer and smaller trapped air spaces when it cools, and is in fact very dense.  If you're lucky enough to be in the right spot at the right time you can observe a pahoehoe flow become an a'a flow as it loses gas (or changes slope and velocity). Of course the Hawaiians were smart enough to wait until the lava cools before classifying it one way or the other. While it is warm and orange, it is just Pele.

0,"When an employee resigns in haste through a highly emotional situation, it is incumbent on the employer to verify the resignation with the employee once the highly emotional situation has passed.  In other words, simply accepting a resignation in the heat of the moment does not fly from a legal standpoint.  This has been supported in case law.  If the facts are as you lay them out, this was definitely a heat of the moment resignation and should be easily supportable through medical documentation.  Also, employers sometimes use the """"probation"""" term a little too liberally.  Even when in the probationary period, employees and employers are subject to all the rights and obligations of employment law. From the standpoint of the employer, probationary periods do not allow them to circumvent employment laws.  My sense here is that the employment relationship is over.  Your choice now is whether or not to sue for wrongful dismissal and for that I would suggest consulting a lawyer.

Not being familiar with the Glock, would it dry fire without the magazine in the gun? My uncle had an accident a whole lot of years ago. He had a Remington .22 rifle with a tubular magazine. He unloaded the magazine and the rifle. He then completely cleaned the rifle, then when finished, put the magazine back into the rifle. He worked the action several times and then dry fired the rifle. Pulling that trigger caused him to kill the toilet in his bathroom with a round he had no idea was in there after emptying the magazine and working the action several times which should have ejected the round.

This bill is so bad, that when asked if they would share it with their constituents, one Republican aide said """"are you crazy!"""" In other words, the Republicans want to pass this act in secret and as quickly as possible, without debate or review or due consideration! Good bye democracy! But then again, our liar-in-chief has never given a rat's patootie about democracy.

Are they really worse off, or is the higher property value simply the result of historically-low interest rates? I do realise that a half percent interest rate increase will be far more of a hardship on a 4% mortgage than on a 14% one, but the West is so deeply in debt that no Western country could possible manage a National debt percentage increase right now. The days of high interest rates are over for the foreseeable future - IMHO.

Questions: Where were KPD cameras? What about profiling? Why wasn’t a traffic stop made immediately when the registration issue was first known – why continue to “hunt” like a predator? What qualifies as “behaving strangely” to equate to “possible criminal activity” Why a high speed chase at night in an area where there is “lots of pedestrian traffic”?

0,"These """"leadership"""" hopeless do not have clue about this issue.  First off since the 1950's with the first refugee convention and subsequent agreements, Canada has agreed that any person who makes it in Canada will have a claim to Convention refugee status adjudicated.  Secondly refugees are exempt from penal consequences for irregular entry as part of our international obligations. We have passed that exemption into various iterations of our domestic immigration law with the latest being s. 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.  In 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada in the Singh decision confirmed that """"everyone"""" PHYSICALLY IN Canada meant exactly that... EVERYONE even those in Canada w/o valid immigration status.  So per s. 7 of the Charter claimants are all entitled to fundamental justice (our version of due process).

All the while, Democrats think they Grubered the young workers into paying for the older and sicker subscribers, but they are too smart for that.  Obamadon'tcare is a train wreck and when it does, it is all the Dem's fault, they passed the law without reading it and the GOP will share some of the blame for not having the will to repeal this mess as they promised.

0,"It doesn't matter, Richard, whether it is new to the Trump campaign or not.  I'm not trying to offer my god-like, cosmic understanding about how all things are all the time, everywhere.  In my opinion, elevating the subject of a conversation from a here-and-now perspective, to a universal, general, supposed understanding of various out-of-context and isolated factors, isn't nearly as insightful as a preponderance of Americans believe.  It is also misuse use of one's intelligence, a thinking error.  And you don't know what I need, but I don't need your focus on me.  I'm sure of it.

0,"If ever there was a fake letter, it's LW1, but of course, we know it's real...unfortunately. Not only is she totally lacking any spine, but her information is incomplete. Fails to give key information (why is niece there, does niece work, go to school, has she previously laid down rules), but with or without those details, the answer is obvious: grow some and kick her out. LW1 is in serious need for assertiveness training. Without it she will teach her kids to let people push them around.

1,"Why shouldn't I be allowed to criticize other people's faith?  Is their faith sacrosanct and beyond discussion for criticism?  We in the West seem to have no problem criticizing catholics or jews...so what makes Islam so special?  From what I know of Islam, it ain't for me (as a gay male).  Do you always look to denigrate someone who has a difference of opinion?  Very progressive of you.

0,"One thing that seems to be overlooked is that """"Mooch"""" is the Communications Director (CD).  Spicer was the WH Spokesperson (although he was kind of doing double duty as the CD as well, as there had never been one hired in the previous 6 months).  The CD is responsible for strategic communications planning.  They are usually behind the scenes.  The WH Spokesperson/Press Secretary is the """"face"""" of the administration.  They are the public carrier of the message.  While the """"Mooch"""" put on a bravura performance yesterday in introducing himself to the Press, we should not be seeing much of him in the future (other than on the Sunday morning shows). Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the new Press Secretary.  So who will play her on SNL? In the past month taking over from Spicer, she has already proven herself to be laughable (no wonder the Press Conferences have been held off camera).

0,"It's more than a little disappointing he's only suggesting one for one.  We need a lot more than that.  He crafted it as a way to criticize Obama.  Things have changed.  We need to go further while we can.  Much further.

0,"The difference is there was a clear need for immigrants in the past. Also there was less taxation in the past and less services. We have already paid so much for infrastructure and now it is being stolen from us.
