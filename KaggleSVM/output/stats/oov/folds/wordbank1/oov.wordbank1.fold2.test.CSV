1,"A convicted murderer gets $10 million dollars from Canadian taxpayers and an apology from Trudeau......This government is really pathetic. What an insult for all Canadians.
"
0,"Yes, compared to Mr. Trump, Mr. Trudeau does look better. I think he has been fortunate to have Mr. Trump for comparison. But that's a pretty low bar. Tell me, do you seriously believe Mr. Trudeau is in charge of this government? Canada is a country being run by a few unelected individuals in the PMO. Maybe they'll run for office in 2019 - but I wouldn't hold my breath.
"
1,"Excellent post.  And while it's true the oligarchy needed to be irritated, it's too bad that Trump, a crazy narcissist, was the guy who prevailed in doing so.  His presence will only serve to steel their resolve in keeping outsiders out moving forward.
"
1,"I don’t think that is what he was saying. He was recommending that men join women in outing the jerks.

0,"Water dilutes cocoa. I like my cocoa very rich and chocolaty. Even a few ice chips will have a watering-down effect. I rarely order hot cocoa out anymore, and when I do it's the real stuff: Giradhelli syrup + milk rather than that bland powdery stuff that comes in a packet. I make it at home; as rich as I'd like, and right out of the gate it's very sippable; hot but not piping hot. When MdD's, Starbucks, etc make hot cocoa too hot, the milk is over-heated, and this is absolutely not necessary. Milk can get VERY hot, and there is no logical reason for their machines to boil it so hot. It doesn't make it taste better. It's not a brewing issue. I've searched far and wide for the logical explanation.

0,"You are spending $200/mth for that warranty.  Plus it will not include a lot of things, typical items such as brakes, tires and likely a lot of other stuff that you thought might be covered.  I would sit down with a pencil and paper and factor in the cost of a new lease and buying out the current lease plus the warranty plus all the extra stuff.  My guess is that the new lease will be cheaper.  Your new car will be more reliable and you will have a better experience.
"
0,"Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer.  Him being there doesn't mean he supports those actions.  I'm all for keeping communication open between all nations.  The practice of shunning nations and sanctions has proven itself counter-productive.  Also, considering the abuse of sovereign nations on our part (military invasions, intervention, support of """"rebels"""", etc.), I'd say it's tough for us to point the finger.

0,"The same old liberal mantra. Always a victim but never an aggressor...You are the one that attacked those with conservative views not the other way around.

"
0,"I agree that the ACA has deficiencies. In all fairness to Barak Obama however, a jump straight from the previous parlous American health non-system straight to a British type NHS would have been too much for even some Democrats to swallow. It would the equivalent of the huge jump from pray-pay-obey to autonomy that most Catholics made after Humanae Vitae. At least the ACA was a step in the right direction, even if an inadequate one.
"
1,"""""Please don't get jaded like the """"millennial"""" generation before you, with their smug """"Bernie or Bust"""" disdain for Hillary Clinton. """"  Well that's pretty ignorant. (And typical of an HRC supporter). As a lifelong progressive, I look forward to the day that the Democratic party returns to it's traditional values instead of corporate fealty. Clinton lost because she was a terrible candidate, venal to the core. We have Clinton and the DNC  (and uncritical Democratic partisans, ahem) to thank for our new Sex Offender in Chief. Maybe for starters though, you could stop belittling entire generations of kids (who registered millions of new Democratic voters for you, even though the party was colluding with the Clinton campaign against them).

0,"I dont really understand the PM's approach here. Lots of overgenerous funding to special interest groups, yet when it come to something that actually matters like healthcare for all Canadians, he takes a page from the PM Harper playbook (despite the many promises that he would be take a different approach with the provinces).

"
1,"I freely admit that I'm happy to see my predictions come true. I knew Trump wouldn't completely repeal Obamacare; it was his constant lying and pandering I objected to on that issue.   He's a pathological liar, a typical corporate elite billionaire. It is obvious he was lying. It's like believing the oil companies have Alaskans best interests at heart when they spend millions of dollars to defeat legislation that will decrease their profits and increase that of Alaskan.  The test is simple:  If their lips are moving and they're advocating anything that will cut into their bottom line, they're lying. It's not rocket  science.

What was lost was the antiquated anachronistic holdover from the days of slavery.  Thanks, Hamilton,  your Electoral College has resulted in the very outcome you designed it to prevent...twice already in this century.

0,"Thanks for this article Scott.  Trump's travel ban has, even though currently suspended by a Federal Court, already cost the United States millions of dollars in lost revenue.  Even while the ban is suspended interest in travel to the United States is down.  If the trend continues it will cost U.S. business billions of dollars and will cost hundreds in the U.S. their jobs.

1,"As a liberal, unionized, government employee let me point out two things:  First, I'm all for the government staying out of this. The theater is a blight on downtown and should either be fixed or demolished. In no way should the state hang a lead-weight around the owners by forcing them one direction or another, nor should the state spend a single penny on it.  Two, quit assuming that just because you disagree with someone that their political leaning is the source of it. Plenty of people think stupid things are just stupid, not because of political ideology but because of common sense.

"
0,"Mike, I choose my words carefully and wrote """"the possibility"""" of collusion.  I consider that it has been established the Russians were involved in interfering in the election; that their interference may have swung the election; that there has been (18, I believe) undisclosed times when the Trump campaign met with Russian officials, that Trump's son-in law and senior advisor, Jarad Kishner, did not disclosed he met with Russian officials, that Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions (maybe 3 times), did not disclosed he met with Russian officials and that Mr. Trump's national security advisor, Mike Flynn did not disclose he met with Russian officials. I think, given the above, to say there is a possibility that there was collusion is appropriate.  Then add how much Mr. Trump is very much acting as if there is something to hide and how much it has been shown that he does not tell the truth,  again, I think stating that there is a possibility there was collusion is appropriate.

0,"Jim Lieb, after 250 years of whites enslaving blacks, 100 years of Jim Crow laws enforced by the KKK, and still more decades of white cops shooting blacks with impunity, is it reasonable to discuss widespread white racism, white terrorism, and the specific concerns of the Black Lives Matter movement? Just wondering...  Yes, Islamism -- the political perversion of Islam -- is a concern. But by far the vast majority of Muslims worldwide are just going about their daily business, trying to be good people like anybody else, and NOT supporting Islamist terrorism.  On the other hand, there certainly ARE elements in Islam -- in Muslim theology or doctrine -- that need careful examination by Muslims, and in some cases repudiation and reform. You're right that SOMETHING in Islam is contributing to the rise of Islamist terrorism, and Muslims who want to live in peace with the rest of the world need to examine what that is and fix it.  But it's not like Christianity has never been used similarly.

0,"Is there no limit to the Ferguson Follies?  He is continually wasting tax dollars on questionable and fruitless law suits.  Who is he really representing, other than his personal quest for public exposure?  I hope the voters are paying attention and we can elect someone to replace him that has more reverence for public policy and public money.  He may believe that his role as Attorney General is a mere stepping stone to a higher office but we, the voters, can eliminate that potential by electing someone better suited for public office.

0,"If too many bishops appear to have one-track minds, perhaps the same might be suggested of the media? Example (which actually has nothing to do with Catholicism, at least of the Roman variety): last night BBC America ran a story on the Archbishop of Canterbury making common cause with the Anglican Archbishop of Rwanda about famine relief. A few seconds were given to that meeting of minds, then an immediate switch: though the archbishops agree on famine relief, said the announcer, they don't agree on the ordination of gay priests. The message was clear: famine relief is boring here at the BBC, so we'll change the subject as soon as possible to gay ordination, marriage, etc., even though it may have nothing to do with our original story. Sex sells; hunger doesn't. (Actually I'm a great admirer of the Beeb.)

0,"I am reminded of a radio phone-in program on BBC World about a year ago. They were talking about Muslim radicalization, etc, after one of the Paris terrorist attacks. A French guy phoned in and spoke about the need to integrate Muslims better. We must do this, we must do that, he said. (I can't remember exactly in detail what he was saying.)  Then a Swedish guy phoned-in to answer the French guy. The Swedish guy said, and I agree with him, that it's not our fault if Muslims don't go drinking in bars and cafes, like they do in France; it's not our fault Muslim boys and girls can't play together and socialize at the bar, cafe, nightclub, etc. He pointed out that there is absolutely NOTHING stopping Muslims from living the same was as most French do. The Swedish guy said, it is their religion and its dictates/prohibitions that is the problem; the problem is not - or hardly at all - with us and our society.

0,"Look to how your coreligionists in Russia are treating homosexuals and then get back to us Catholics.  The fact we have a largely celibate priesthood means we have many same sex attracted men in the priesthood and you will rarely hear a peep from the pulpit about sexual morality.
"
0,"Some of the """"complexes"""" may be charging more than they need to but most privately owned condos are charging what they need to to make payments, pay HOA fees, taxes, etc. and not lose too much (you make the profit in the increased value of the property.  If you try to actually make a profit from the rent alone you will find that no one wants to pay what you need to charge.)  It is expensive for everyone, the owners and the renters.
"
0,"Part 2  But if the employer had to pay $15 per hour to each of the five disabled workers, the total cost would be $75 per hour. Therefore the employer would personally lose $58.50 per hour by hiring the disabled workers. Assuming a 40 hour work week, the extra cost would be $121,680 per year. As much as employers enjoy helping disabled workers become productive members of society, most can't afford to pay such a high price for the privilege. So if minimum wage """"protection"""" were extended to disabled workers, ironically the real winner would be the worker without a disability who gets a job, and the losers would be the five disabled workers who lose theirs.  Liberals feel good about themselves for """"protecting"""" the disabled, but in reality they protect non disabled workers from having to compete with disabled workers. Instead of being employed at $3.30 per hours, five disabled workers would be unemployed at $15 per hour. But zero times $15 is zero. Too bad liberals can't do the math!

She was one of the """"Philadelphia Eleven"""" ordained in a schismatic act July 29, 1974 by three retired bishops of the Episcopal Church acting as episcopi vagantes:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eleven  The House of Bishops admonished Episcopalians not to recognize any of the eleven women as priests until the next General Convention could decide on their ecclesiastical status.  It was not until the General Convention of 1976 that she and the other ten were received into the Episcopal Church and granted status as """"priests"""", which began the continuing disintegration of that denomination which continues.

0,"Take and eat, for this is my body. (Bad proof texting on your part).  We have faith in the witness of the apostles for the Resurrection. That witness means more than all the Sacraments.

I can see why magicism is the rule of the day in the hiearchy and among trads. In a magical paradigm, women can not be ordained for questions of validity (good magic). If you have a faith paradigm, there is no reason at all not to do so. I used to think it was just sexism, but I am changing my mind. That is also the reason behind Continence, which has poisoned the entire well of Catholic sexual theology.

Oil tax credits in Alaska make the Federal earned income, child tax , and child care credits look like peanuts!  The oil tax issues need to be addressed simultaneously with any state income tax.

0,"Excellent guest viewpoint.  I would add that local law enforcement does not have the resources to take on enforcing federal immigration law in addition to their current law enforcement responsibilities.  They are already hard pressed to carry out the latter.  Also, if local police are seen as enforcers of federal immigration law, they will lose the trust and cooperation of members of the immigrant community.  Fearful of the police, crimes will go unreported by victims and people will be unwilling to come forth as witnesses to crime.   Those committing crimes will escape arrest and the whole city will be less safe than it is now.  The Lane County sheriff and the chief of EPD do not want to get involved with enforcing federal immigration law for these reasons.  It is state law that law enforcement at the state and local levels cannot arrest people whose only offense is being in the U.S. without papers.  However, if they commit a crime they face arrest and being turned over to ICE.

Russia as the USSR made such good friends with all the other Central European states (former Warsaw Pact members) they could not run to NATO fast enough.  That """"run to NATO"""" is realpolitik: the real consequences (fear, hatred, mistrust, so many others...) due for occupying those countries for nearly 50 years.  As for the Cuba side issue:  USSR could have as many troops as they wanted, but no first-strike nuclear weapons on Cuba - that why it was called the """"Missile Crisis"""", not the """"Invasion Crisis"""".  Finally, as for responding to Article 5, I suppose the only way to find out is for Putin to invade, and take the chance of starting WW3.  You think Latvia is not significant enough for NATO to defend it.  I think Putin would be very unwise to test NATO over something so relatively insignificant as Latvia.

0,"Trump put lipstick on his pig of an immigration executive order.  Trump’s second immigration executive order is still a step toward fulfilling his promise to ban all Muslims from entering the US.  He has never retracted that promise.  As Supreme Court Justice Souter said, the world is not made brand new every morning.  Trump has a history of discriminatory statements regarding race, religion, national origin, and gender.  He is trying to create the world in his image.  That is why there is so much resistance.  Trump’s favorability is at an historic low for a president this early in the term, and it keeps dropping.  More and more Americans see what the Trump presidency will be like, and they are dismayed.

A lot of people would resist paying, and then expect $1200 a month when they hit 67. It's the same with insurance - younger people pay into it to support health care for the elderly, and when the young people get old, they get medical care. That's the fundamental principle of all insurance, that everyone pays. But some people expect that even though they pay no insurance, they will get medical care when they need it. Sure, they'll get emergency room care, but if they own anything it will bankrupt them, and if they can't pay, then people like you and I have to pay the bill.  Do you think that's right, Bill?

0,"IMO since the main purpose of religion is to teach “good” values it becomes important that any religious individuals or groups recognize when the same values are shared by nonreligious people. The same is true regarding nonreligious perspective of religious people. It seems, however, religion, despite its inconsistencies, has positioned itself ideologically as a “good” value and teaches that anyone without it is bad or somehow lacking in the ability to have values or be good. As long as that view exists, there will be conflict between both groups which detracts from solving common social problems or challenges. That’s what appears is happening. Based on having a religious affiliation you’re judged either good or bad which couldn’t be further from the truth. Common ground for all people in a society will never be found through religion if it’s ideological values are not applied so that all people feel equally “good”, religious or not.

My point--supported by the correct answers to my questions--is that the CSA and USA were, in fact, enemies during the Civil War.  Certainly the North killed as many Confederate soldiers as they could, and some rogue soldiers committed crimes against Southern civilians. Sherman's March to the Sea is as infamous for its cruelty as it is famous for its success.  You seem to be unfamiliar with the timeline of American history. The original 13 colonies formed the United States in 1776, won their independence in 1783, and ratified the Constitution in 1788. The Civil War didn't start until 1861; by then there were 34 states.  Washington died in 1799 and Jefferson in 1826. John Sullivan coined the term """"Manifest Destiny"""" in 1845, although expansionism began with Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

I don't feel that way now.  I fear, in fact, that our Republic is at great risk, because at the highest levels of our Government, there is a permissiveness and lack of quality assurance and safe control over the President, and a complete lack of wisdom or courage in the leadership of Congress.  In short, when coupled with the narcissism, crassness, and idiocy of the President, that means we are all at great risk.  Mueller needs to hurry.  Congress needs to grow a pair and act.

This makes sense given that Elway is paying his #1 wideouts about $21 million.  A better evaluation would be to look at what Latimer and Fowler do when Thomas or Sanders come out of the game.  What my eyes tell me in that situation is that the Broncos don't throw to them - meaning the Broncos don't think they are suitable replacements.  Thus it makes sense to try out some newcomers at that position.

A fast-spreading, invasive species closely related to milkweed, DSV is sufficiently similar to milkweed that monarchs lay their eggs on it, but then the caterpillars can't eat it.  DSV is Roundup-resistant, so the more this invasive plant takes over fencerows and trails in Eastern Ontario, the more monarch eggs are lost.  The DSV invasion is something concerned environmentalists can do something about.

One of my favorite examples of the forces of anti fascism is that of the landing craft at Normandy unloading thousand of Allied soldiers while underneath the caption says, """"Group of anti Nazi protesters confronts a large gathering of Nazi sympathizers"""". The time to confront fascism has long come and gone even as the evil has grown inside the nations heartland. We defeated it before and we will defeat it again. The Nazis in Charlottesville were given a permit for their rally on Saturday but they went off the rails on Friday night with the tiki torch parade so their permit was revoked. Meanwhile the anti fascist/racist/nazi demonstrators were given a permit by city government for a rally in a different part of town on Saturday.

The complication in earlier years was that the Senate would try to extract further concessions after a draft treaty was concluded by the Executive Branch. This complication has been removed by the recent practice of the Executive Branch obtaining Senate commitment before negotiations formally begin that a resulting draft treaty will be voted on without amendment.  Now, however, we face the prospect that Trump will personally insert new issues, up-end positions agreed to by his own negotiators, etc. at any stage or at the conclusion of a draft agreement.

On the other hand, by declaring that employment discounts and so forth are taxable, the CRA makes businesses liable for the reporting. Some will cheat no doubt, but many will dutifully follow the law. The resulting extra tax revenue would undoubtedly be in the billions, and the CRA barely has to raise a finger to get it.

0,"""""Or do you think the Shari'ah is superior to secular pluralism?"""" That's an interesting question. I don't know enough about Shari'ah to compare it to 'secular pluralism'. I'm supposing 'secular' here means 'worldly' (material) in contrast to spiritual. With respect to the commonness of all life, the 'spiritual' (soul) is one with the'material' (physical) in existentially the same way. So i would assume that what is right for the 'material, secular' is right for 'soul, spirituality' when it is right personally, and, vice versa. What is truly right for the body must be right for the soul.(?) Most religions politically misconstrue soul/body relationships in institutional self-interest, and validate their spirituality on presumptive reasoning. The fact that people are divided because of conflicted religious presumptions implies (proves) that religions are conflicted (in error) with respect to their laws. In validating common law of common life, religions may see to validate each other.(?)

Was he interviewed prior to his admission to PNAC by the diocese or by PNAC and if so, did his past simply not come up or if so, did it not raise any red flags?  I also question why he was sent to PNAC rather than St. Patrick's Seminary where other students for Reno-Las Vegas were completing their seminary training at the time?  How could his past have escaped the interview process before entering seminary or spiritual direction while he was in seminary?  Or did it not matter?

0,"To much of  the Lutheran and Anglican world who have moved toward Arminianism and away from double predestination, or classical Calvinism, there is agreement with your main argument. I don't think anyone in your church is ignorant of the major theological differences with the Calvinist and Pentecostal  wing of the Reformation. Therefore talking about unity between """"Protestants"""" as a general term, and Roman Catholics, is not productive. It does however make a useful cudgel for Catholic trads to bash any ecumenical efforts. These efforts have borne fruit when they proceed on specific denominational tracks. I think Kung is steeped in German, Swiss and European religious culture. Diversity existed for the first thousand years of Christianity. The Apostolic churches established in Asia (long before any western Franciscans or Jesuits showed up) by the hand of an Apostle, developed organically into churches with views not always consistent with the church of Rome.

Some members of the Springfield Council were in on the secret plan all along.  PeaceHealth, intent on vertical integration to move itself as close as possible to monopoly control of local health care, wanted the big open site so it could control all the doctors offices located nearby. They were more than happy to locate inside the service area of its major competitor so it could harm McKenzie-Willamette financially.  Eventually the move helped put M-W in such a disadvantageous position that it had to sell out to a national hospital organization and cease  being a true community hospital.  PeaceHealth got all its own way, in every way - getting local governments to use up huge amounts of state and federal highway money solving their impacts.

0,"I tried to reply to this post stating my belief that, fortunately, most people around the world (including Muslims) take religion (or parts of it) with a grain of salt. As an example, I quoted  Deuteronomy 22:13-21, which mentions what must happen to a woman who has lost her virginity before her wedding night.  """"....But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die"""".  Then, I mentioned that if this was taken literally most of us would not exist.  My point was to show how absurd would be taking literally something that was written may centuries ago.  I don't understand why the message was deleted or not even posted. I guess better that than me being stoned (or something of the sort) for stating my views.

0,"How much funding is involved and how much will actually be directly employed in teachers instead of administration? Of the 23000 people mentioned, let's say 12,000 are children. Of these, 8%  (960) are being educated on the 23 reserves. That means there will be on average approximately 40 students on each reserve school spread out amongst kindergarten to grade 12.  The distribution of the students is not equal across all grades. The skills of a single teacher do not cover all grades and therefore perhaps 3 teachers will be required for 40 students. Some very small reserves will have a school with only a couple of students yet will still need at least one and possibly two teachers. Each of the 23 schools will have some degree of administration from the band.  On the basis of the numbers, the self-governing agreement does not appear to be a recipe for future success of the students. The inescapable fact is that the remoteness of the reserves results in less quality education.

The lines have been in place for decades and electricity is purchase separately yet Just the 'delivery charge' (electricity flowing through existing lines) cost is equal now to the price of the energy.  ComEd lobbied to allow that to be a separate charge and now, the delivery cost is just a little below what the entire cost was before they started itemizing additions.  They are copying corporate 'additional fees' like the airlines and cable companies now use to hide their gouging.  Just this week, a flyer offered a """"bundle deal"""" for $55 for phone/internet/cable TV.  I called pretending interest and finally pinned them down for total cost per month after the trial offer.  55 became 157 a month for exactly what they promised in big print once we added the fees and the fine print.

0,"The Polish National Catholic Church and the Old Catholics are not two branches of the same tree.  While the PNCC obtained its orders through the Old Catholic see of Utrecht, they have never been in complete agreement doctrinally, and some years ago their communion was severed with the ordination of women in the Anglican Communion.  The founding of the Old Catholics had nothing to do with papal infallibility, which was defined in 1870 at Vatican I. The separation occurred in the Netherlands in 1724 over some arcane jurisdictional issues. It was 146 years later that the Old Catholic see of Utrecht provided orders to the schismatics objecting to papal infallibility.  At this time the “Old Catholics” are somewhere left of the Episcopal Church in theology and shrinking, while the PNCC is growing smaller by the year and superannuated.

Once you allow the politicians to get the 'nose of the camel under the tent flap' by allowing the politicians access to the Perm' fund,  you'll loose the fund within 20 years.  The same with an income tax, once allowed, it will take on a life of it's own that can't be stopped allowing the politicians to continue to spend and spend.  The politicians first need to cut the 'fat' out of the budget, probably about $2B and then hit the 'rainy day' funds for the rest.  Oil prices will improve over time.

The problem is """"corporate"""" with oil and gas companies catching and releasing employees like fish. Why don't they start with management? No, they trim frontline workers who then carry a bigger workload burden. If they complain, they are replaceable. There's always the threat of job loss hanging over their heads - something those in public service don't have to experience on a daily basis. My spouse survived until the final cutbacks but did his former company trim management? No. Frontline workers that were not released carried huge workloads and heavy schedules - taking it for the team. I welcome green energy with wide open arms - big oil and gas execs need a taste of their own medicine. How dare the company use some of the profit margin to cover the cost of keeping loyal front liners until pricing rebounds!  Notley is right - we need to diversify.

Highly doubtful. Why don't you move into a district where schools are struggling and send your kid to the neighborhood school? Get involved and make a difference that way? I actually went to DPS during bussing and I loved it. My parents actually believed that every child deserved and equal education and white liberals should not just give it lip service until it comes to their kid. If DPS is serious about equality lets start with offering comparable curricula in every school. Check out the difference between Manual and East.

0,"I'd conceded that it could be an issue. I'll wait to see evidence of it - and a response may be more rights for businesses to discriminate based on pot use. It's been legal in Eugene for nearly 2 years (not to mention recreationally for longer) and the tech industry continues to grow. I'm not remotely going to say that pot use (as with alcohol or any prescription drug that impairs function) should be used with certain jobs. But I also won't hold the conclusion that just because a substance is legalized means it will hurt local economies or prevent job creators from choosing it as an area (you failed to offer evidence that it does). And say it did - local governments still have the right to ban it, and rightfully so.  Have you ever been to San Francisco or met people in the tech industry? The fact that Eugene has pot stores would almost be a perk for that industry. Your anecdote is weak. But if I was a construction company I'd have some legitimate concerns.

0,"Did you read the article?  The whole point is that, as private citizens, we are not bound by the strictures a court is. This makes perfect sense. I can't throw you in jail - no matter what I think you may be guilty off. A judge CAN. So a judge is held to a higher standard - one of the principles of that standard is that he is required to presume innocence if he is presiding over your trial.  But there's no such requirement for me (or Professor De Vos) as ordinary citizens. It would be a gross violation of my right to freedom of opinion and freedom of expression to say that I can't have my own opinion. Both before and after a trial - we have the right to think judges err - they are only human after all, this is why there is an appeals process: because even the judiciary itself recognizes that it's not an infallible institution. I believed, at the time, that the judge in the Oscar Pistorius case had erred by sentencing him too lightly. As it happens: the appeals the appeals court agreed.

0,"There are many voices speaking in favor of legal pot for so many varied reasons: It's medicine. It will relieve prison overcrowding. It's not as bad as alcohol. It's not as bad as cigarettes. It's not as bad as ice. It's not as bad as opiates. It's part of the real world, and those opposing it aren't with the current times. What puzzles me is that the arguments above don't apply to the real reason: Otherwise healthy folks want it legalized so they can get high. Kids are already getting high anyway, and more and more cool parents are okay with that. In fact, every school should have at least one family growing operation whose kid is the main vendor for that entrepreneurial niche. The next generation will be accepting of pot as a healthy life choice, and regularly get high as the new normal. That about right? By the way, I work with teens, and that last paragraph isn't made up--it's the current reality.

0,"2) covering inexplicable in pseudoscience because you don't like a non-scientific explanation...  I am not sure what you are talking about.  Could it be Lourdes where there is 'no explanation for a cure'.  No explanation for a cure is not sufficient evidence for a miracle.  Rather, it is an argument from ignorance.  What was assigned to a god from primitive times is now known not to be from advancements in knowledge.  What is known at Lourdes to be considered  a miracle will also be known tomorrow as no miracle at all.  That is exactly what has been happening throughout the history of mankind e.g. the god of the gaps.  Science is self correcting.  Religion is not.  When science presents a falsification to an hypothesis, the hypothesis is immediately dropped and abandoned.  When religion is presented with a falsification, the falsification becomes a metaphor.

After the Second Vatican Council, (1962 - 1965), another edition was published specifically for the Roman Rite in 1983."""" Catechism is also a relatively recent creation (from US Catholic.org), """"In 1566 the so-called Roman Catechism was published in response to the request issued three years earlier by the Council of Trent.

Pay attention to one thing in particular: the number of times that leaders proclaimed a racial or religious conspiracy by a different group in order to justify oppression, war or genocide, vs the number of times such a conspiracy really existed.  The first number, you will note, is quite large. The second is zero.  This is not to say that history isn't full of atrocities. The point is that they are invariably inflicted by those who have power onto those who don't.

The 90 and 120 days are long gone since Trump signed his executive order. Meanwhile, Trump shot himself in the foot a few weeks ago by depicting Qatar as a terrorist-supporting country, then a few days later selling them $12 billion in weapons.

Further a switch to proportional representation would almost certainly require a constitutional amendment.  Without such an amendment it would, at the very least it would face a very strong challenge in the Supreme Court, leaving the outcome of any election held under such system prior to the court ruling totally up in the air.

I'm fine if we keep looking for savings, including previous  spending locked in by stubborn bureaucracies.  As money/wealth flows into the hands stock shareholders and stock compensated management, revenue collection has to follow it.    It's basic math, you have to collect tax on income where you find disposable income.    *The wealthy will pay more than their 'share' of total tax collections (as they do now), but they have more than  their 'share' of wealth and opportunity as well.

Because public schools don't get to pick and choose the students (the """"raw materials"""" to go into an educated individual).  When I worked for 9 months at a plant that made portable light towers, we didn't make do with a panel painted slightly the wrong color, or use a tailpipe that was an inch too short.

Under the current way of doing things, public schools don't get to send back parts that are detrimental to producing an educated person (i.e. a student that shows up not wanting to learn or having low ability).

And what a lame attack it is. According to you, white supremacist groups have been """"emboldened"""" by Trump failing to immediately distance himself following the Charlottesville violence. On what grounds do you make that astonishing assertion? Has there been a sudden spike in right-wing extremist violence in the last week? No. Are right-wing extremists marching on Washington?

But that's wrong, as any number of histories of the crisis, as well as the FCIC, will attest. The two FMs were late to the party, and trying to compete with private sector firms such as Countrywide. Wall Street pushed sub-prime and knowingly sold bonds full of junk with A ratings from ratings agencies that they themselves paid to pension funds. And deregulation - which started under Clinton and quickened under Bush - contributed greatly to the implosion. Finally, both Democratic and Republican presidents have pushed home ownership.

Culturally there seems to be big differences for example leaders  likening themselves to Jesus. A population that accepts such horrific desigration of religious piety or farthers that accepts as normal the arrogant impregnation of their daughters by old men in BMW's, earned to be lead by such as Zuma. There can be no future without a basic shared value system of what cannot be violated. If we thought the ANC will set those moral values, it is now clear the ANC is precisely the biggest threat to such values. Getting rid of Zuma is actually easy but for the immorality of those that must take him out. Those who took an oath before God to uphold the constitution and laws, to immorally lie before God in the assembly of the people that they have confidence in Zuma, represent the people of south africa.

In light of overwhelming evidence of widespread corruption and looting of state resources by Zuma and his sycophants, State Capture by the Guptas, etc. the best the ANC can come up with is to fire a member who stands up to such nefarious behaviour. This once-proud liberation movement is a pale shadow of its former self, an abomination, lacking any integrity, morality, credibility and self-respect.  Instead of silencing Makhosi Khoza, the ANC have amplified her. She probably has more supporters now than the pitiful ANC itself.  How about throwing the disciplinary rule book at those who deserve it (starting with Zuma and his cronies) and those destroying the wonderful legacy of ANC icons and luminaries like Oliver Tambo, Nelson Mandela, Ahmed Kathrada and the thousands of other heroes.

Ms. Day and her staff may envision some kind of world-class dining experience available for passengers after they clear security; (raise the BS flag here). I, like millions of other travelers, want to get to or near my gate (how many times has it changed from when you check in until you board?), grab a sandwich and cold beer, and say adios to this airport, on to the next.  The airlines are asking for adherence to the KISS principle.  Lastly, does DEN have some sort of study, documentation, directive, etc. from the FAA, TSA/HSA, somebody? that tells them their current configuration is vulnerable? Heck, the whole airport is vulnerable. The drive into the airport is like the floating ducks in a shooting gallery.

How about we lower admin salary, they make in some cases 2 or 3-times what senior (masters+ level educated) teachers do for roughly the same amount of work.  Or how about we look closely at the districts mysterious “outside consultants” line item that is funded to 6+figures year-over-year?  4J has historically had the most top-heavy administration of any school district in Oregon and regularly create (unnecessary) positions downtown - glutting the admin budget even further. This happens year-over-year regardless of who is on the board or at the helm.  4J admin has a long history of pork-barreling downtown in absence of what's best for 4J students.  Blaming teachers/union for class size is like blaming a dentist that you have a cavity.

By far, the most significant ongoing barrier was comprised of physicians, of all sorts. This is not to say that ALL physicians are of this ilk, but the priest-hood attitude of many, their intransigence, their insistence that they are the top of the pyramid & that is it entirely up to them whether to collaborate with other health professions (or not), is the height of arrogance, and an insurmountable barrier.

It doesn't take much to figure out that the rest of us pay more to cover those who received care without insurance or other means to pay. ACA isn't perfect, but with it, more people have access to appropriate care, which fits with the Christian ideal of caring for those less fortunate, and more pay toward their own personal medical care, which fits with the expectation that people should do what they can to support themselves.

0,"The Globe should address the main point of controversy that they have consistently and purposefully ignored: the implications of assertive Islamism (or political Islam) in Canada.  Attempting to appease or accommodate this belief system has resulted in social division, segregation, and parallel societies in Europe where regressive ideas of modesty and misogyny are defended by fundamentalists under the guise of cultural relativism. Even in Canada, we see private schools teaching kids that boys and girls are forbidden from physical contact - how does this encourage social cohesion? The point is that face coverings and the belief system it is associated with have absolutely nothing to do with cultural relativism or religious freedom - gender equality is a function of progress, full stop.

Buckley and that was a mistake for Lee as Buckley was a great debater.  However, the Vietnam War did show that we lost thousands of young people needlessly as the war should have and could have ended a lot sooner.  When politicians are the deciders of our young people's lives, it's always the young people who lose.  More recently, we were told of mass weapons of destruction in Iraq which proved to be a total lie.  I trust people over 40....I just never will trust a politician.

0,"It does not take a psychic or psychiatrist to read the official firing letters and the FBI Memo from Trump's Deputy Director of the FBI to conclude that Trump was not firing Comey for the reasons stated in the letters and memo The memo strongly criticized Comey's handling of Hillary after after the FBI concluded its investigation and declined criminal prosecution. Comey released derogatory information on her handling of classified information and made what the FBI called a closing argument against Hillary without a trial. The memo soundly criticizes Comey's letter to Congress just before the election as a serious break of FBI policy. The Assistant AG citing FBI Policy and the FBI rules going back to several past Attorney Generals, including a comment from Eric Holder-- Obama's AG--on Comey's violation policy by delivering the letter just before the election. So Trump fired Comey for treating Hillary wrongly. The FBI vindicates Hillary.

0,"David Kelly - The success of a public fear-campaign by fluoridation opponents (FOs) in a community is not proof of the validity of the claims made by FOs any more than successful campaigns by fluoridation supporters is proof that fluoridation is safe and effective.  Scientific facts are independent of public opinion which can easily be manipulated by activists.  That is one of the reasons claims that much of Europe does not fluoridate their water are irrelevant.  What is important is the fact that the scientific consensus of experts in the field continues to be (after 70 years of research) that community water fluoridation is a safe and effective public health initiative.  If that were not the truth, more than 100 health and scientific organizations would not publically recognize the benefits of fluoridation for reducing dental decay.

0,"The Minister of Canadian Heritage has had a soft ride so far, but there are several misconceptions in this article.  Yes, net neutrality concerns the principle that all content and applications should be treated equally without ISP or telecom interference. But this principle relates only to undertakings and actions regulated by the Telecommunications Act, not the Broadcasting Act.  The Broadcasting Act gives the CRTC complete sway over Netflix, but the Commission declines to exercise it. (An earlier 2014 Supreme Court decision concerned ISPs only.) Unlicensed television undertakings, such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube could be regulated by the CRTC, if it chose to do so.  Pierre Nantel says Mélanie Joly is promising grand reforms while the barn is burning; in the meantime the Minister leaves the impression of conducting a consultation on how to design a fire extinguisher. Pierre Nantel is right and his cry of alarm applies to the situation in English Canada, as well as Québec.

It was a gift from France to commemorate 100 years of American independence in 1867.  Designed by Frenchman Edouard de Laboulaye, the statue represents Libertas, a Roman goddess, and was named “Liberty Enlightening the World.”  Since de Laboulaye was an abolitionist, the chains at the base of the statue may have had more to do with America freeing slaves than anything else.   To say that the statue is a national symbol for the country’s embrace of immigrants is a rewrite of history.

We called Roseburg Forest Products """"Hog"""" Lumber Company"""" because they hogged all the sales at the public timber trough. They drove smaller federal timber bidders out by over pricing them.  From the 60's on, """"Hog"""" devoured many millions of board feet of premium timber from federal forests at a quarter of real market value. They cashed in on millions of dollars of federal road building gravy. In the 80's RFP heavily cut over their private lands. Lands that were public domain before Oregon's politicians gave them away. Lands they now receive huge property tax breaks on.  Today, RFP is global, yet still one of the largest purchasers of public timber.  Like most big timber companies, they have been continually subsidized by America's forests, infrastructure, taxes, and labor force.  The least they could do is make it right for their workers.

The wrong-headed intervention of some bishops and other clerics in the election, using their pulpits, bulletins or newspapers, to advance the candidacy of the racist, fascist Republican nominee, does disproportionate damage to the credibility of the church, harming not only other bishops and clerics, but also the """"responsible Roman Catholics"""" you describe.

Can the president raise money and invest and spend it wisely? Above that, keeping all the machinery running effectively and not alienating any powerful factions pretty much rounds it out. A president can damage the culture of a university but has limited power to change it. The success of most of the efforts Schill is making will depend much more on faculty and staff and their willingness and ability to further his efforts.  It is a huge good for a university to keep a competent president for a long time. OSU has had a powerfully competent president in place for over 13 years, and that 13 years is a rich source of knowledge and experience and a strong supporter of good and effective judgment. Stable presidents create stable leadership in general, and consistent expectations and practices and values.

I don't have a problem with women getting paid less if they took off work for 6 years to stay at home with the kids and are lower on the career ladder because of it. I think it is a societal issue if women end up doing that because of societal expectations rather than from completely free will.

0,"From your Breitbart source:  In 2014 this happened:  """"Iran-backed Houthi rebel fighters, who have destroyed much of the Hudaydah port while they import munitions for their war efforts, have reportedly exasperated the situation. In 2014, Houthis overran Sana’a, the capital of Yemen, and pushed the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi out. Several months later, Hadi stated that the Iranian regime “would like to see the destruction of the country.”  """"However, starvation and malnutrition have been a problem in poverty-stricken Yemen long before the 2011 uprising that cast the country into the beginnings of a full-blown civil war.""""  Like in Syria, the US, under President Obama, and implicitly approved by the Congress by providing the money, has chosen to be on Saudi Arabia's side against Iran in Yemen.  President Trump got his Gold Chain of subservience from the King this year, President Obama got his from the King in 2009.  President Bush got his in 2008.

Sorry, but once he asked the public for help to start his business (why not get a business loan from a bank?) he was giving the message he would be serving all the public, not just those whose weddings he likes or agrees with because of his religious beliefs.  Because people trusted him with their money to do the right and legal thing, they also have a right to ask for their money back (if they so choose) when they feel they have been duped.  And that *is* GoFundMe policy, from what I've learned recently.

An indication of how much of the nations wealth is controlled  by those 1% of the nations people is that just that small tax completely pays for the subsidies that allow 10 million Americans to finally be able to afford to buy health insurance. Oh and that vast wealth they control also allows them to buy the huge bullhorn they have used to confuse Americans into believing that they are paying for """"those people"""" to have access to health insurance. The wealthiest of them ala the Brothers Koch were responsible for the bulk of the anti ACA propaganda that was generated by the barrel full and disseminated by media on the left right and center.

But the meta-question is, should the Catholic Church still believe that doctrine must be logically coherent? And it seems the Pope Francis answer to that is: No, to heck with logic, to heck with intellectuality, the global Church doesn't care for that tired old Western stuff, this is the new Church of emoting and hugging and off-the-cuff preaching and beach balls on the altar and universal concelebration, hooray, let's make a big mess!

All the Anglo-American countries well-fed in their comfortable homes, mostly islands surrounded by large bodies of water and nominally safe from invasions, lecturing other countries how to behave or else.

Anyone who has traveled to third world can understand what daily existence is there and why they'd want to flee.  But... as those of us who work full time and struggle pay check to pay check, we know how hard it is to maintain a decent lifestyle. When these Sudanese came, did they think that there would be certain benefits given to them or that they would be welcomed with open arms? This is a much different country than it was 100+ years ago when the Europeans fled to come here and right now there aren't that many of us with the energy to embrace the horde that is coming this way. In that way I think Trump is right. We need to make America great again (so that we can make room for those who will come.) If we open the gates now, it could very well bring us down.

It makes no sense to oppose contraceptives and sterilizations - especially in this day and age when so many women have choices about how they will live that did not exist even 100 years ago.  And better health care means both a woman and her husband will live long lives and - if they are lucky - can enjoy each other physically for many more years than most of their grandparents ever had a chance to do.  And, more children live to adulthood.  We don't need to have 10 children so that 5 live to help work the labor intensive family farm.

0,"The Natives of Alaska's south, west, and north coasts settled in permanent villages due to innovations and requirements by the white colonialists, not because they preferred that lifestyle. They had been nomadic; coastal sites were merely seasonal (as many subsistence camps outside the villages still are). Cultural change has been very complex; however, a settled life was required by churches, schools-- and trading, which replaced game populations that firearms had decimated. Those who say """"Just move, as people always have without problems"""" are referring to basically nomadic cultures (including many in Africa), not established settlements. A couple of books are: """"The Eskimos of Bering Strait"""" (Ray, Univ. of Washington Press), and """"The Native People of Alaska"""" (Langdon, Greatland Graphics); there are more recent ones.

Wilson, the 'father' of the modern Progressive Movement, was both a racist and bigot, and Obama, a leader of his own Marxist Movement follows unto the same path within that his own ideology, and policies, follow the path of the group, race, or identity of the group matter more than the individual that may belong, within his belief system, of said group.  Again, Roy.....  Prove me wrong.

America is the land of contradictions and politically is about as polarized as ever, dismissing one another is not the way out of this mess.  As North Americans we need to find ways to come together.  Sports has always been such a vessel.  In Canada think hockey.  In the US it is football, baseball and basketball.

I'm sure a lot of Republicans will be hiding their names and distancing themselves from their contributions to the research opps and attempts to trash Trump, and are more than happy to shunt the blame onto the Democrats.

Toxoplasma gondii can only complete its life cycle in the intestine of a cat.  The cat then sheds the microscopic oocycsts (eggs) in its feces by the tens of millions per cat.  No other animal sheds oocysts in its feces.  Humans and other animals become infected by ingesting the oocysts.  It only takes a single oocysts to become infected.  Oocysts can be carried to food items by insects or rodents or even the wind.  In dry conditions the oocysts can become aerosolized and inhaled, causing infection.  Humans and animals can also become infected by eating the undercooked or raw meat of an infected animal.  But that infected meat animal became infected by ingesting an oocyst.

In 2005, construction of a new school began in one of these closed communities on George AFB, but as soon as the Air Force found out, they shut it down because disturbing the soils posed serious health risks to workers, etc. We don't understand why these high levels and increased health and exposure risks are permitted in MCBH, Pearl Harbor and Hickam housing, especially during 8+ years of active housing construction and persistent soil disturbing activities that further increase health and exposure risks to thousands of military children and families who are not warned or informed.

He has advocated for parental choice in education like most other states in America are doing. There is a reason why Alaska public schools are at the bottom in academic achievement and certainly the NEA monopoly is one of the root causes.  Of the few options parents have, all are outperforming their public counterparts. Senator Dunleavy believes in academic achievement and the current system is far from delivering a product we can be proud of.

Older was simply incorrect in his assertion  GST was cut long before the recession, and offset the fall in the Debt Service charge at approx $4BN - It was the Personal Tax Revenues falling $11Bn when they would normally rise $3-3.5BN and the resulting rise in benefits that drove the deficit; you can see from the Fiscal tables we ran a cyclically adjusted Primary surplus  https://www.fin.gc.ca/frt-trf/2016/frt-trf-16-eng.pdf  Hope that helps

0,"Eric, having  been discharged from the USASA just before the Viet Nam war exploded, I was  teaching at a large Midwest university during the war.  I recall 3 basic reactions of the young men to the draft: 1. Accept your draft call-up, and go fight whether you believed in the war or not.  A lot of those guys never came home, or if they did, they were often damaged physically or emotionally.  My heart goes out to them all. 2. Publicly oppose the war and refuse military service, which many did even though this was often costly, sometimes even leading  to having  to  leave America.  I admire these folks for their idealism. 3. Find ways to avoid service even though favoring  the war, claiming that as a college boy you are superior to all those minorities and farm boys doing the fighting and dying.  I loathed such jerks then and still do.  Typical of such types was  Don Trump who graduated from NY  military school, used 4 college draft deferments, and a """"heel spur"""" to avoid serving in VN.

"
0,"wiliki's linked study had various methodological flaws.  Many analysts discount the reliability of the Perry study. For example, Hanushek and Lindseth (2009), among others, claim that the sample size of the study is too small to make valid inferences about the program. Herrnstein and Murray (1994) claim that estimated effects of the program are small and that many are not statistically significant. Others express the concern that previous analyses selectively report statistically significant estimates, biasing the inference about the program (Anderson (2008)).  There is a potentially more devastating critique. As happens in many social experiments, the proposed randomization protocol for the Perry study was compromised. This compromise casts doubt on the validity of evaluation methods that do not account for the compromised randomization and calls into question the validity of the simple statistical procedures previously applied to analyze the Perry study.

In the fall of 1963, when Kennedy died, the CIA was on the ground in Vietnam, and so were about 16,000 """"non-combat"""" military personnel. 122 were killed that year. About 3 weeks before Kennedy died, a military-led coup ousted corrupt, despotic President Diem. Suffering Buddhists were jubilant. The U.S. had no direct involvement in the coup, At one point it appeared US was willing to provide President Diem transportation to escape--which the CIA urged him to do. He was slow to do it. Transportation never materialized and Diem was captured and assassinated.

We can and should do all we can do to move our baseline power sources to nuclear and renewables but it is fallacy to think we will see the end of oil production in even 100 years.

Hillary supporters asked for a count of the cards still in the Caucus Leader's hands, but never got it.  Eventually, a party person announced 86 votes and 4 delegates for Hillary.  It was probably fewer votes than Hillary deserved.

None of those jobs, of course, would be lost by the academic-bureaucratic liberal elite; safe in their jobs, looking forward to their indexed pensions, they can put their own glows of conscious virtue well ahead of the welfare of their less privileged fellow citizens.

Recall the priest says """"May the Lord accept the sacrifice at my hands and yours..."""". The priest is not turning his back to us, he is facing Liturgical Eat with the whole congregation and offering the sacrifice of the mass.  If you think about it, the priest facing us has to make the mass about himself - Is he interesting? Does he seem bored or troubled? Is his hair nice? Does he seem tired? But the mass is not about him or his quirks.  Facing east with the people, his personality diminishes in importance as his individuality is totally subsumed into the awesome moment of sacrifice.

The Mass doesn't exclude anyone...many many many graces are available to all.   We must not let a faulty understanding of Church teaching rob those not in full communion with the Church from these other graces.  We mustn't perpetuate a falsehood.  Receiving communion in a state of grave sin for anyone (e.g., a still adultering hetero husband) hurts their soul.  We mustn't as Scripture tells us """"receive unworthily"""".

Reputation.  (Sensuality is another defect. It's placing one's security in the things of this world.

Corporations do not pay taxes (gasp) it's a line item in the P&L and a cost of doing business that Raises Prices for the end product.  If the US got it's corp tax house in order we might be able to coax companies that offshore their cash resources (APPLE Inc. is an example, see: https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/01/apple-earnings-q2-2017-how-much-cash-does-apple-have.html) to return that money back into circulation in the US economy and stir up a little more activity.  They would pay taxes on the $ and generate more economic activity along the way - increasing job growth and eventually wage growth.  You see, when you tax something (economic activity) you get less of it.

0,"If you compare the price we pay for milk at retail to the price in Europe, New Zealand or the USA, and include all taxpayer subsidies, you will find our milk to be as cheap or cheaper than it is elsewhere.  People are rebelling against """"free trade"""" because it costs people their jobs.  The USA and the UK have voted in favour of higher prices if it saves jobs.  Trump is braying against the Milk Marketing Boards but he also wants to limit imports of cheaper goods if it means losing jobs.  Of course Trump also feels the US should be able to sell its goods to others without restriction which is ridiculous.  We need managed trade with tariffs designed to encourage fair trade and not just put in to protect entrenched inefficient operations.  The old autoplan was a great example of managed trade that benefitted all parties.

0,"I agree that President Schill's letter was well thought out and was a class act. The UO is really fortunate to have him at the helm.  However, that sound-proof room in which Professor Shurtz has lived does call into question whether she can be qualified to teach law. Law has a huge underpinning of history and (ever-changing) societal norms. If she doesn't have a handle on those, what else is she deficient in? Perhaps she can continue to teach, but I would like to see this looked into a bit more than it apparently has/will be.  That said, it would have been inappropriate for President Schill to address that in his letter.

0,"In addition to general praise for his not further inflaming the Middle East, Obama deserves specific praise for allowing the UN to once again formally declare that under international law (Geneva 4) all of Isreal's annexation of lands it occupies is illegal. MSW's correct assertion that in any conceivable future two-state solution not all of these settled lands will not be returned by Israel, does not change the illegality of current and future settlements. The potential importance of this internationally supported UN resolution is that it insists the status quo is not the starting point for a peace settlement, but rather that Israel must bargin for whatever it eventually retains--it gives the Palestinians some bargining chips.  We must never forget that the Israeli justification for the settlements is the proposition that these lands are theirs by Dinine right, and thus their right wing political parties do not actually accept the Geneva Convention.

Their goal is similar to the ISIS group who want to establish their Muslim Caliphate over he whole world. This needs to be prevented.

Then, they were told that the gas plants would not be well placed, and they ignored that. They were told that the green energy plan was exceptionally stupid, but they went ahead. They were told by everyone not to sell Hydro, but they did that too. First thing the government needs to do is to give a damn about the average taxpayer and resident of Ontario, then they need to listen.

It is hugely thrown around by changes in the economy, far more than most states. I have seen programs and services developed and built in good times and then abandoned in bad. Sometimes within a few years. Sometimes they are rebuilt again, sometimes not. It's incredibly irrational and wasteful, and it damages the lives of both the employees and the people served.

We are all free to choose to live by a religion's standards or not. So if you don't like the treatment you're afforded under one religion, seek another.

Any LGBTQ person is welcome to be a student, although I don't see why they would want to be (or frankly anyone else).   Presumably we can all control our sexual urges  -- certainly the law expects us to be able to.  TWU also expects heterosexual non-married persons to refrain -- so that is the largest group that the statement """"discriminates"""" against.  Assuming that you buy into the idea that sexual interaction is a necessary part of sexual identity, then you can get to where you are and no doubt many people, including certain members of the SCC buy into that argument.  The real issue here, however, is about balancing rights.   Where the LSUC overstepped its bounds was that it did not adhere to its statutory duty to uphold the law as it stands -- the law on this """"as it stands"""" is pretty clear.

Owning a cat is not a right, it is not a requirement of being alive, IT’S A HOBBY. If YOU can’t pay for all the costs incurred in that hobby then FIND A DIFFERENT HOBBY.  I bought 5,000 rounds of .22s on a close-out sale for only $15, with plenty left-over in case someone in the area wants to start up their vermin cat-hobby ever again. Even $0.003 spent on any one cat is too much as far as I’m concerned, but that’s all that I’m willing to pay to “fix” YOUR vermin cat for you. I shouldn’t be forced to pay even that much, but since you won’t pay to “fix” your vermin cats, then I will “fix” them for you in the most humane and cost-effective method on earth.

The message is clear and as old as our country: """"I may disagree with what you say, but I'll defend your right to say it."""" Sure the message of the lawfully permitted protestors stunk, but we don't silence people we strongly disagree with by attacking them with concrete filled soda bottles and sticks. And the police did nothing to separate the lawful permit holders from those who predictably would show up to attack them. They could have prevented chaos and carnage and stood down because the city government was upset they lost a court battle with the ACLU and were forced to issue the permit. That's southern style selective law enforcement. The family of the lady killed should sue both the murderer and city of Charlottesville.

Nope, not for me, I'll work to de-excalate the anger long before I accept that the United States will deteriorate into tribal warfare.

There are provisions that prevent the conversion of dividends to gains in non-arm's length transactions.  OK extend them. The government also seems to want to tax any earnings earned by the corporation that are not distributed in the same tax year to the shareholders.

In my opinion, OSU has made more progress, while the UO has, unfortunately, focused more of its time and effort on athletics.  The U.S. News rankings, frequently cited by colleges and universities across the country, should not be considered by institutions as the ultimate barometer of academic quality or student satisfaction.

Bannon was correct in perceiving an unspoken motive behind the Catholic Church's support for illegal immigration, but he missed the mark on the actual motive...economics is secondary, while their true primary motive is political power! Always has been, always will be. The RCC ever seeks self-aggrandizement and the power to compel others to follow the dictates for their unholy papal dominion.

From those who actually do research and crunch the numbers on Dodd-Frank:  http://fortune.com/2015/10/14/bank-earnings-dodd-frank-democratic-debate/  Key:  So you might not think Dodd-Frank is the perfect fix. Wall Street certainly doesn't. But the big banks are more lending focused then they used to be. And they have much more capital than they used to so they can absorb loan losses, which was really a big problem in the financial crisis.  That's why right now, at a time when Dodd-Frank seems to be having a bit of success, it's an awfully odd time for people to bash it

That means some defense attorney is down at Mat-Su pre-trial right at this moment, cooking up some garbage defense for these cold-blooded murderers or otherwise angling to extend, obfuscate or otherwise plea down the charge.  Remember what happened with the hit and run last summer in Anchorage? What did that girl get, 2 years to serve? It will be the same in this case. Almandinger, though charged as an adult, might not have to be tried as an adult. And since his accomplices rolled over on him, they surely will get some kind of immunity or deal.  I will call it right now, Almandinger will plea out with something like 20 to serve, out in 10. That is probably the best the DA will be able to do.  Remember to direct your outrage to John Coghill and Gov Walker if it comes to pass.

It is true that Trump has told lies about his past, like claiming his first wife, a competitive skier, was an Olympian, but he has never given the impression that he was delusional, as Hillary Clinton consistently did. Her lies about her life history went back to her infancy, when she claimed she was named after the New Zealand mountaineer, who didn’t conquer Everest until years later. She lied about dodging sniper fire at Tuzla airport in Bosnia, long after the Bosnian War had ended, even though her account was clearly contradicted by newsreels taken of the event. As Robert Fulford wrote, she seems to suffer from mythomania, a pathological tendency to create myths about herself.

For me, the limit has historically been a P/E of 10 or less -- but that would preclude owning some terrific dividend stocks with solid track records for increasing dividends every year.  We are buying stocks with inflated dollars that themselves pay almost no return in a low interest rate environment.   Raising interest rates may artificially reduce stock prices but it will also not help the fundamental problem that so much wealth has been created 'artificially ' but no concomitant means of investing it has been developed.

0,"I would like to see more respect for facts and logic in American politics. On the other hand some of what the economists tell us is questionable. The unemployment rate, for example, does not include people who have given up looking for work, doesn't tell us what groups are doing well and which aren't, and is a temporary snapshot. The economy moves in short cycles but long-term trends, such as the reduction of people in the workforce, are more important. Likewise it's hard to accept low inflation figures when you checkout at the supermarket.  It's hard for working-class people to trust happy talk from the """"experts"""" when we're struggling to get by. The upper middle-class professional experts are doing well, but we are not.

Obama still has over 5 months to go and a very good chance at the debt hitting 20 trillion. While he has in fact doubled the debt, he had help. During his first two years, the democrats controlled both houses of congress. Because of that and democrat control of the Senate until Jan. 2015, the debt grew slower but still grew far too fast. The roots of ISIS are Al Qaeda. The roots of Al Qaeda began in Afghanistan during the soviet occupation. A long time before 2004. A much more militant faction of Al Qaeda moved into Northern Syria sometime in the mid 2000's. After Obama unwisely pulled troops out of Iraq, refusing to continue to negotiate a status of forces agreement with Iraq, the faction in Syria, dealing with Syrian military brutality and excesses, became even more radicalized and militant becoming ISIS.

0,"The article does not inspire confidence in the author's grasp of either economics or administrative regulation. . Carbon pricing and cap-and-trade schemes share the common objective of forcing the internalisation of negative externalities. . They tend to be popular because they are, relatively, self-enforcing market-based solutions, whereas  proscriptive regulation and criminalisation of negative externalities tends to involve high enforcement costs and perverse economic incentives that often defeat the purpose of the regulatory regimes. . Nonetheless, virtually the entirety of the criminal law and tort law are based on internalisation of negative externalities.  Sometimes that is appropriate:  We will never use cap-and-trade or price mechanisms in respect of stealing or killing, although the """"blood price"""" tradition in many countries is just that. . Other times, as in prohibition of alcohol long ago, and marijuana now, market-based mechanisms would be much more effective.

Everyone involved in trying to rescue, plus those who tried to revive them have never forgotten the children. This very sad event will affect the lives of so many people for a very long time.

I wonder if he even slowed down at all.  Safety is no accident. Safety comes with proper driving techniques and attention, not just keeping it upright and between the lines.

Most state unions got years of raises either zero or one half of inflation or worse - meaning their wages went down due to inflation. No health insurance and retirement are gone or going by the wayside. I'd accept """"you"""" getting a free ride if you would agree to get none the benefits and no union representation when you have a problem with the employer.

0,"In the academic world, seniority plays a small role in determining pay.  Pay is often set to the minimum level necessary to keep the faculty member in the face of competitive offers from other institutions.  The amount other schools are willing to pay for a particular person depends on how widely respected they are professionally.  A winner of prestigious national or international awards, for example, might expect a higher compensation than a faculty member who has no awards or lesser awards.  With current gender awareness, a female equally """"famous"""" compared to a male will make more.   The academic position is generally we will pay you a little more than a competitor will.  Want more money, bring in competitive job offers to prove your value.  Sadly, what Freyd, by filing this suit, is revealing that she is not as well regarded professionally as she thinks.

They are the firewalls against increasing anti-Semitism, not the other way around. This stirring up of negativity by Sanders toward populist parties in Europe is predictable and I knew it was only a matter of time before he played the Hitler card.

In some states really great parents who test positive for pot can loose their kids. I read a horror story about a texas family loosing their son this way to a foster parent who murdered their son. I think women are afraid to admit using pot during their pregnancies so it's understudied. It's so common to smoke during pregnancy and I know at least 20 mothers off the top of my head who have and all those kids (grown to infants) are normal or exceptional. I really think that pot could actually improve brain function some how because I see so many kids/adults who's mom's smoked during pregnancy who are ahead of the pack with coordination and language. A lot of these pot smoking moms also tend to be more educated on nutrition and medicine. If only we could be more open and real studies and not propaganda were available.

0,"Not really. It's standard practice in nay sort of agriculture to plant many more seeds than the number of mature plants you seek. There are always losses, so you plant lots, take the losses, and then thin as the plants get bigger. If I wanted to get four mature marijuana plants, I would start at least a dozen plants. If you are only allowed to have fur baby plants growing, you are likely to only get a yield of one or two mature plants.  Further, the four plant restriction is fine for indoor growers, who can get multiple crops per year. If you grow outdoors (which should be encouraged) you only get one crop per year, which needs to produce enough yield for the whole year.

The DOE's existing structure is stuck somewhere in the 19th century.  Charter schools are showing the way.  Like regular schools, the success of charter schools is mixed.  However, there is a significant difference in funding.  The charter school per pupil allocation is about $6,100, while the overall per pupil support for public schools is $11,500.  If charter schools received more, they would be able to do more.

Pride is of course a vice, and it is countered with cheerful and near constant acts of humility, until it gets put back where it belongs.  A good spiritual director can listen to someone's use of language, and how they interact and help people to tame various evidences of pride, or vanity, and over love of comfort.  Takes work.  This is the sort of work that is done in a real virtues program.  Pride creates a lot of anger, and other unconstructive responses.  Can really damage relationships.

The source of the information specifically did not want it shared, in fact had not shared it with other allies because they are concerned about the possibility of outing their source.

0,"If you read the reasons carefully, the judge is relying on a theory that the complainant was able to consent right until the point that she was unconscious.  Though I have little experience of people passing out drunk, in cases I have witnessed, they are obviously not competent in the minutes leading up to passing out.  It isn't an instantaneous change. Indeed, the law is that someone can be incapacitated by alcohol and unable to consent before the point of being unconscious -- surely the minutes before passing out would be that degree of incapacity.  Also note the judge specifically stated that the arrest and charges were justified given the circumstantial evidence that suggested there was an assault (and Blatchford's shock that he then contends that no evidence of assault was presented).  The Crown is obliged to drop charges if they deem there is no possibility of conviction, not just because they think they might not win.  The latter would be to allow the Crown to be the judge.

As a result, we came within one sell out crowd (51000 votes) at Olympic Stadium of losing the second referendum!  Virtually all of the provisions of Meech Lake are now in force through a combination of legislation, regulation and tacit adherence.

Table 3 shows that Personal Taxation fell $11BN, whilst Table 6 shows GST rose $1.2 BN - Fairly obviously, if GST revenues go UP and Personal Tax  falls, Personal taxation is the problem.  Table 10 shows $5BN increase in Employment Benefits for 2009.  So people losing their jobs directly cost the Feds 20X the the G20 Boondoggle.

There are vast numbers of reports of North American men, many of them caucasian, perhaps many of them """"Christian"""", killing or abusing their wives and children, or their girlfriends.  Why decry an entire religious group because of rare extreme acts of violence while ignoring the extreme acts of violence motivated similarly by control issues, wounded dignity, the view of women often as property, and, no doubt, some feelings of offended religious principle.  We all need to stand against intolerance, violence, inequity, and extremism, no matter who is promoting it or enacting it.  We need an intolerance for intolerance, when it is activated primarily by skin colour, ethnic origin, or religious preference.  Our world won't be made better for any of us through hateful exclusion and finger-pointing.

That being said, I completely understand the impetus behind the movement, and acknowledge that its reasons are absolutely sound, and reasonable. So, here we sit, with a real issue, and an imperfect solution.  History matters, even, if not most especially, the history of wrong-doing.  It is also important to acknowledge that change is good, current modes of thinking are not absolute.  Lastly, it is important to be open to the """"gray"""" areas.  Many of those who want the statues removed fight ceaselessly against binary thinking, and ask for more open minds when examining complex social issues.  It is not unfair to demand the same from them. In my opinion the statues need to remain.  But, the current blind reverence they invoke needs to be altered to acknowledge the real failures of both the persons, and their times.

Often the newly installed dictator grows comfortable with the security apparatus the CIA has built for him. He becomes an expert at running a police state. And because the dictator knows he cannot be overthrown, he becomes independent and defiant of Washington's will. The CIA then finds it cannot overthrow him, because the police and military are under the dictator's control, afraid to cooperate with American spies for fear of torture and execution. The only two options for the U.S at this point are impotence or war. Examples of this """"boomerang effect"""" include the Shah of Iran, General Noriega and Saddam Hussein. The boomerang effect also explains why the CIA has proven highly successful at overthrowing democracies, but a wretched failure at overthrowing dictatorships.

Lie number two: People are paid what they’re worth in the market. So we shouldn’t tamper with pay. The facts contradict this. CEOs who got 30 times the pay of typical workers 40 years ago now get 300 times their pay not because they’ve done such a great job but because they control their compensation committees and their stock options have ballooned.  Meanwhile, most American workers earn less today than they did 40 years ago, adjusted for inflation, not because they’re working less hard now but because they don’t have strong unions bargaining for them.

0,"Weren't we discussing how it is wrong to jump to conclusions and make accusations without substance?  For example, the accusation that Clinton had violated a law based on an investigation.  Now the investigation is closed with no finding of wrongdoing, those who accused, some might say, should apologize.  Of course this is different from those who accuse clergy of wrong-doing.  They should always apologize, especially when the clergy are shown to have done no wrong.  A good example is poor Bishop Finn--many here continue to accuse of him of wrongdoing just because he was convicted of a crime.  What a double standard!  Sigh.

0,"The 2020 election will include the new election methods that we passed as propositions 107 and 108. Unaffiliated voters will vote in primaries. The idea that Democrats will have a lock or any party, may be a fallacy. The largest block of non-partisan voters (unaffiliated) surpassed the membership of both Rs & Ds about ten years ago. The Democrats would like to believe that this block of unaffiliated voters are left liberals or progressives. And of course the Republicans would like to believe that same idea is true for conservatives right of their platform.  Considering that there are over 30,000 registered Libertarians (far more than Greens), and the state has a tendency to vote purple - even Obama celebrated the """"libertarian spirit of Colorado"""" in a state of the union - it's difficult to tell how things will go when unaffiliated voters get to vote in primaries.

Employers won't be taxed allowing more money to the workers.  Doctors and hospitals will still be private.

0,"This practice began more than 40 years ago as one of the consequences of a deeper understanding of the communion rite. In the TLM low Mass (its most common form) the people didnt pray the Lord's Prayer aloud and didn't make any connection with """"give us this day our daily bread"""" and the reception of Holy Communion. In those days the reception of HC was infrequent. Praying the Mass in a language people could comprehend led to a new understanding of receiving communion as not just a private act of piety but also as an expression of being united with Christ in all the members of his Body. Joining hands at the Lord's Prayer became one aspect of visibly expressing the faith of a community which prays """"Our"""" Father rather than """"My"""" Father. I don't remember any priest telling me that I should or must offer to hold hands with those nearby. Nor have I told anyone that as a priest. As the bishops stated there is no rubric directing people what to do with their hands during the Lord's Prayer.

0,"When we talk about Canada's need to reduce GHGs why do we not discuss this country's carbon absorption capacity, one of our great potential competitive strengths? Given our forests and geographic size, measured on this basis our CO2 offset potential is vast. The Global Carbon Project reported in 2014 that, of the 36bn tonnes of CO2 emissions produced by humans, 37% of this was absorbed by land. On this basis Canada may already be absorbing 20-30% more CO2 than we emit. Surely this factor should be part of any climate strategy equation? But it is not. If you are worried about deforestation in countries like DRC, Brazil, Russia then you need to consider ways of incentivising them to preserve what they have.  Providing them with tradeable carbon credits based on their CO2 absorbative capacity strikes me, at least on an initial view, as a viable alternative to what our PM and others are proposing.

As for his being a disappointment from a business formation and capital expenditure perspective, I think he is not in the least complicit.

The 2016 homicide rate in Anchorage was 11.3 per 100,000 people last year, and that had nothing to do with foreigners. I am all for reducing violence. But we should focus on effectiveness while maintaining our civil rights. Isolationism will not strengthen us.

0,"TryingtoStay: You seem like a very fair and balanced person to my ears, who is willing to listen (thoughtfully) to the sincere concerns of someone who is very turned-off by the pressure that many young people are experiencing these days to 'accept' that they are gay. I do think that peer pressure and a changing culture have led to more young people identifying as gay. My sister noticed this way back in the early 1970s when she noticed that when young women at the all-female college that she was attending had a 'bad date' (or two or three), they almost immediately jumped to the conclusion that the reason they were having such a hard time finding a compatible male partner was because -- without realizing it- they had been 'born gay' and therefore were unattractive to men. In previous generations they simply would have said: We weren't compatible. I sometimes wonder how many of those young women entered into 'the life' (and I don't mean religious life!)

0,"There once was a time when a Liberal Arts degree provided the students with a well rounded education in philosophy, history, literature, foreign languages AND science and mathematics. These programs were the most difficult to enter and the most challenging to finish.  Of course to round out the education of engineers and scientists they were (and still are) required to study outside of their core subjects with requisite literature and humanities courses, and quite rightly so.  Somewhere along the way however the Liberal Arts faculties saw fit to water down the curriculum by essentially eliminating the 'hard bits' such as requisite mathematics and science courses. They have also lowered the bar to program entry by not even requiring the more challenging STEM courses in secondary school.  To still be considered a properly 'educated person' in this technological world that we live in, capable of critical thinking, how can STEM subjects just be side-stepped?

When in fact, the correct answer is you can only win the presidency if you win the electoral college.  Let me explain, CA and NY matter.  All 50 states matter.  All 3,000+ counties matter.  Each vote matters.  But the way they matter is based on the system (the electoral college) that says, """"hey candidate, if want to be president you need to make sure you have support across a broad swath of America.  This is because, as the guardian of democracy, I want to make sure that vast majority of America is represented.  Therefore, I give you a cap on how much a particular place will count in the electoral college.  Go above that fine, but you need minimum support everywhere.""""

Considering the fact that in many dioceses,  the bishops brought priests over from India, Africa and the Philippines [sadly many are difficult to understand---and many are confused with what is demanded of them from their pastors and parishioners], having clear-speaking women delivering the homilies would be a breath of fresh air.   Get over your 'we've always done it this way.'  It is time for new growth.

0,"The """"hatred and discrimination against Muslims"""" is unwarranted to anyone who has ever read the core doctrine of Islam (the Qu'ran) and found it to be rife with commands that anybody (anybody without their head in the sand, that is) would find reprehensible to a modern society. It's not a cultural issue, it's an ideological issue that people have against the teachings of the Quran and an issue against the jurisprudence that developed from the Quran and Hadiths (Sharia Law). Canada can not allow for the practice of Sharia Law within our borders (which is already happening in many parts of Europe)...That is ultimately where the """"fear"""" of Islam comes from.

Everyone from Coupeville, Clinton, and Utsalady would be kissing the Navy's backside if they were that generous. I believe South Whidbey and Camano Island would be minimally impacted if the base were to ever close.

The fact that only one of the two users of roads (motor vehicles and bikes) has to pay any usage-based taxes/fees is wrong.

Women can preach, counsel, run parishes, recite words in sacramental texts, wear vestments, advocate, encounter, bring the Gospel to people, etc. etc.  just as well as men.  That is NOT though what the heart of ordained ministry is! Ordained ministry is at root the making present of Christ """"in persona"""", the same male Christ who continually referred to Himself as the """"bridegroom"""" a specifically nuptial/male role that simply is not conveyed with a female acting as ordained minister.

I have never understood why we employ highly trained experts in the field of transit then ignore their plans for something that was dreament up the night before. If Smart Track was really smart it would have already been planned by the experts.  The billions being spent on that ridiculous subway to Scarborough is evidence enough that politicians are a very big part to the problem and not a solution.  Experts should draft the solutions and the politicians worry about the funding and the timing on roll out of the project.  Thank You for this article.

0,"Why buy out your lease?  You would be wise to lease a new one or buy a certified pre-owned one...it would cost you less.  If you buy yours you have to safety the vehicle (if it is 4 years old you probably need brakes and tires...$2k ) you have used it during its best life time.  You now have to pay the taxes on the buy out as well.  If you shop...I am willing to bet you could get a certified pre-owned for less money when you factor in the safety and taxes not including future repair bills as the vehicle is older...just my two cents.

You wish the best for teachers?  Yes, education can be partially paid from your property taxes until they reach """"the cap"""". Rent an apartment?  You pay the property tax; it's in your rent. I know mechanics with large tool boxes they had to buy themselves.  Do you work on school buses?  Before """"outside private enterprise"""" took over the busses in Ketchikan, it was the mechanic's money but the local business kept the money in town. Which got passed on to your property tax. I've watched the Legislature turn down highway money at 90% Fed, 10% State funding.  What was the money spent on?  Pork MegaProjects we never saw.

They all sold it to Canadians as good for jobs and good for the economy.  Since the romance with China started with PET Canadians have lost close to 500,000 high paying blue collar manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs are not only the foundation of our middle class, they actually add value to the economy.  Those half mullion lost manufacturing jobs have been replaced with part time jobs in the service sector. For the most part service sector jobs are recycled dollars and do not add value to the economy the way manufacturing jobs do.  Along with our manufacturing sector we have turned China into our proxy GHG emitter. Trudeau has Canada on a starvation diet while the Chinese are gorging themselves on GHG's, literally eating our lunch.  Trudeau is selling Canada to the Chinese.

Otherwise healthy people who take daily medication for ADHD or mild depression and function just fine with it are barred from enlisting in the military, despite the fact they want to serve their country.

Neither side seems interested in democracy or entrenching  human rights, which tend to be the keys to ending conflict.  It seems impossible to imagine that this carnage and killings of hundreds of thousands of civilians is better than a few reforms. Given the extreme citizen timidiity  in non-democracies, I suspect people would have gladly settled for the simplest tokenism in terms of reforms.  What's needed now is extreme restraint against nations like the U.S. which tend to pour in with misdirected aid that is then used to fuel more conflict, such as its absurd funding of Palestinians and Israel without  sufficient ground rules to ensure peace. Until and unless entrenched human rights are guaranteed and democratic reforms are implemented, Western nations need to limit aid. Every dollar needs to be contingent upon a new deal.

The bill retains the constitutionally mandated Electoral College and state control of elections, and uses the built-in method that the Constitution provides for states to make changes. It ensures that every voter is equal, every voter will matter, in every state, in every presidential election, and the candidate with the most votes wins, as in virtually every other election in the country.

0,"The idea that a slur is """"just a word"""" is wrong, whether the slur is about race or gender or nationality or class or occupation or employment or ability or disability or speech pattern or education or ethnicity or hair color or height or weight or attractiveness or sexual orientation or political affiliation or religion or military service or age or generation or neighborhood or style or possessions or national origin or the thickness of one's neck.     I will agree that it is good to understand that people are complex and to recognize that the fact that a person will use a slur out of ignorance or even intentionally does not completely define that person.   But it is quite parochial to think this is an issue merely of """"this country"""" or """"racism"""".   Human beings do bad things, like ignoring what is wrong about using slurs.   They have always done bad things like this, in every place and time.    Sometimes they do bad things more often than here and now, and do worse things than use slurs

0,"It seems to me that there is a history that goes all the way back to the early Church. The persecution the early Church suffered resulted in a sense of always being under attack, which persisted even after Constantine made Christianity the official religion. That sense of being under attack, combined with the belief that the Church should be the primary and at times the sole arbiter of truth and salvation, resulted in a sense of the right and indeed the obligation to be the institution that ruled or at least ordered  society. That worked until the Reformation. Vestiges of this continue in this country in the attitude of the bishops that if a society makes decisions  counter to Church teaching, or if people are vocal in their disagreement with an aspect of those teachings, this constitutes a persecution. If you believe that it is your duty to ordain how society is, then any dissent is seen as persecution. Hence the Fortnight of Freedom and other manifestations of a siege mentality.

Despite the rhetoric, they are NOT citizens.  Citizenship is not a technicality.  It is a birthright.  I don't hear the immigrant rights groups condemning Japan, Saudi Arabia or other countries that don't allow any immigration.  Just guest workers.  Realistically 800,000 more workers will not fix Social Security or make it solvent.

0,"I like to remind people of the letter, signed by 150 professional wildlife biologists and wildlife managers from Alaska and around North America, which was sent to Gov. Palin. All those years back they told her predator control was a poor method for management and urged her to end it as the voters had already said they wished to happen. Shortly thereafter a dozen former members of the Board of Game sent her a similar letter which went on to say the BOG needed to be made up of professional wildlife scientists rather than by people who profit from wildlife. The voters voted against predator control but a small group of """"wildlife users"""" hijacked the system a decade ago with the help and support of elected officials. And the peoples will was ignored. When it comes to our wildlife the majority does not rule and that should not be the case in a democracy.

0,"The treatment of victims of sexual assault has been raised many times and yet this mistreatment continues. A previous GM article spoke to the number of sexual assault cases deemed """"unfounded"""". Thankfully that article caused a positive reaction and a review by many police services of thier ivestigative practices. The shortcomings of all aspects of the Canadian justice system do little to provide a safe environment for a sexual assault victim to come forward and report. I feel that there are many more victims out there who are trying to muster the courage to overcome the anticipated lack of response of the justice system and take that final step and report. I fear that because of cases such as this that victims won't make that report and another perpetrator gets away with this crime.

0,"Of course, one of the unfortunate realities of sexual assault is that it is very often hard or even impossible to prove. However, just because a case does not have enough evidence to proceed successfully in court doesn't mean that a case should be dismissed without a thorough investigation that is respectful and compassionate toward the alleged victim throughout.  There are two major issues here that we need to do better at  1. Too many victims not getting justice. Unfortunately, given the nature of the crime itself this is one issue that we may never truly be able to resolve. We cannot undermine the basic tenet of our legal system, which requires due process and conviction only when a standard of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt can be met. However, I do believe that it is possible to respect victims and give them at least a sense that the system cares about what happened to them, even when there is no conviction.  2. Victims being afraid to come forward with allegations.

Created with the express intention of keeping Germany from re-surging after WWII, the EU imposed a bureaucratic same size fits all norm of government on all its members, causing internal tensions to build in all of them.  These tensions flow simply from the fact that all of them had quite different internal dynamics, partially defining their different statehoods – all of them for many centuries except Germany, that became a unitary state only in the latter 19th century. Ironically Germany benefited most from the EU and liberalised. Now neo-fascist movements are springing up all over the EU. Madrid's brutal repression of the Catalonia election reminisce of fascist repression.  Now arresting its top legislators smacks of an African dictatorship removing top opposition leaders before a new national election.

If your first resource is contraception, and there isn't much in the way of secondary resources, or much sense that society has any dignified use for you or any children you may choose to have, it's not a huge leap to think there's a whiff of eugenics around that first resource. I think well intentioned people can easily miss that, and fail to appreciate how that can contribute to the understanding that little value is placed on the lives of poor people of color.  Birth control is fundamental to women's equality, but it will not achieve the equality of poor women of color.  It just won't. It opens up worlds of possibility to women who do not belong to the underclasses, but those worlds remain largely closed to the rest, however many children they do or don't have.

0,"I would not count on the journal Nature to claim fact in a redefining of 'gender'; many new theories come out of it, but it certainly is not a tome of across the board accepted theory. Look, when the baby comes out of the womb, a doctor assigns whether it is male or female not by some 'innate internal sense of self'- that is subjective, relative self selection.  No, the doctor sees if the baby has a penis, and testifies via external observation for a legal certificate that a male has been born.  If the doctor sees the baby has a vagina, the doctor obviously testifies via external observation- for a legal certificate- that the person is a female. As for the comments on employment and sports, my comments weren't about verification of genitals but rather pointing out that critically discerning between male and female is a major feature  of affirmative action, the basis of female specific opportunities and point of contention per legal sport segregation (i.e. title nine).

This is biased reporting of a kind that's all-too common in today's MSM. An allegation is printed as fact, and then picked up and repeated by numerous other media outlets.

Which PM cut 900 jobs from the Veteran's Affairs and rewarded upper managers with 500,000.00 in bonuses? 7. Which PM used 1.2 billion dollars from the military budget to put on displays of their party celebrating veterans. In the military this is known as a chicken hawk. I imagine you won't be able to get them so here are the answers. Harper is the PM all 7 times. For the numerical part of the questions: 2. 0, 3. 0, in fact he didn't even make it to the design phase.

What can each of us do to make our home and country one in which all of us individually believe and  behave in the common good. In this instance, to what degree is the wearer of the burqa prepared to contribute to the tradition of uncovered faces and facial recognition. When she immigrated to Canada surely she must have known that this expectation is rooted in values, morals and ethics of Canadian life.  The turmoil is self induced.

0,"I watched a sad show on channel 7 about other countries that legalized marijuana and sell it in coffee shops.  The young people are being destroyed by it.  40% of all users end up with a psychosis condition.  Ironically they cant see it because their brain has been altered by THC.  The rehabilitation centers are full of young people in denial who started with pot (the soft drug) which led to harder drugs.  The sooner young people start smoking pot the more likely they will be scared for life.  If Alaskans were properly educated about the drug it would never have got legalized.  To knowingly add this curse to the existing curse of alcohol and other legal drugs is the straw that will break the camels back.  Its hard to understand how bright minds with the world ahead of them would choose to destroy their mind with brain altering drugs.  It think that every violation of law regards to legalized pot sales should be automatic suspension.  Press the curse down and get it gone.

0,"The author got it right in the first sentence, the census is but a snapshot of a single day in the past. That is the inherent problem with a census, its nothing more than a snapshot in time. As a result, a census is useless for planning purposes and best used for historical pondering.  Roughly 1 million Canadians relocate (move) between the time the census collection closes and the first release of data occurs. Over 7 million Canadians move between each census taking.  It's little wonder given these facts, that when governments and their agencies use census data for planning purposes. They rarely get it right, and how could they when they are using outdated census data that can't take into account the ever shifting demographics of the country.  Maybe Stats Canada should do a study of the money wasted by governments who use their data for planning purposes.

Or are these *people* just inherently superior to everyone else, according to U of T professor King Mark?

0,"PeterL, I agree with you about 'constantly changing and adapting'.  We always need to look critically at ourselves to see if we are making positive or negative contributions to society as a whole.  I agree, however, with Marc Frick in that there are definitely nations/cultures who have completely morally unacceptable practices and therefore could not be considered 'no worse' than 'our own' culture.  But maybe there is also a midway point on this issue because we need to define what is 'tradition' and what is 'practiced' because without a doubt the so-called 'civilised' west is behaving (and I'm generalising here) completely immorally.  Here I refer to the 'practice' of waging war on any country that doesn't do it's bidding.  But I don't define that as 'tradition'.  For example, it is tradition in some African cultures to mutilate women's genitals.  It is simply reprehensible and could never be justified.  Maybe war is 'tradition' though in which case maybe Mark is correct?

If most shelters have a waiting list and a few have openings all of the time, then you have to ask why. Talk to the homeless and ask them why they do not want to go there.  Yes, the public has that impression that people choose not to go, because that is what the media, parrots all of the time, repeating the same thing over and over, when its not true of most of the shelters. There are roughly 15,000 homeless in Hawaii a year, there are about 5,000 beds state wide. Do the math. Correct, sweeping people from place to place does not work.

Also, most of the time the person who changes their gender, despite hormone treatments, does not change their sexual attraction for the opposite sex if they were straight so basically they are creating many gay men from women & lesbian women from men.  This is a problem because if they were married & often they were, their spouse is not attracted to the new body since they are not LGBT & the transgender person is still in love & attracted to their original spouse & they divorce.

You also fail to acknowledge that public sector workers earn approximately 15 - 20% less than the equivalent private sector position. Where public sector employees come out ahead is their pension.

If you read Cromwell's dissent, he takes the majority to task for relying completely on evidence on the operation of the judicial system that was never subject to cross-examination. (He actually contrasts this against the rich evidentiary foundation behind R. v. Morin, to highlight just how off-side the Supreme Court has become.)  The Supreme Court would toss out a criminal conviction in an instant that relied upon evidence that was never subject to cross-examination, but the modern Supreme Court sees fit to completely revamp the timelines governing the system without the benefit of properly tendered evidence? It's a disaster.  Those of us in the legal profession need to speak up. R. v. Jordan is unconstitutional.

Mr Trump is never too busy to do what he can to shame companies to keep jobs in USA from New York, 140 characters at a time at all hours of the day and night.

Otherwise he'll be forced to fire that guy, too. Maybe the guy after that, until he finds one to agree to follow his suggestion....because it can't be called an order if the option to disobey it exists.  Trump's could write up an executive order ending the investigation, I suppose.

Actually, Trudeau’s fiscal policies have strong similarities to Trump’s. They both have pledged expensive infrastructure programs to stimulate higher growth and are willing to run big fiscal deficits and run up the federal debt to do so. A big difference is that while Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary promised three to four percent growth every year that Trump was in office, Trudeau during the election campaign promised only a higher growth rate than the PBO had forecast for the next four fiscal years, i.e. better than 2.4% growth on average. So far, from October 2015 to November 2016, the actual growth rate has been pathetically short even of this more modest goal, just above 1.5% per annum.

0,"Appealing to authority, e.g. Nature, simply does not work in science because no matter how authoritative you are you can be wrong. Science responds to hard data.  All the data you mention does nothing to indicate the cause. For example, if the cause is due to women being more likely to take time off to start and raise a family and then finding it very hard to get back into science again having quotas will do nothing to address that. This is why science exists: when confronted with what looks like a possible problem we investigate to find whether there is a problem and what the cause is.  Climate change is a perfect example of this. Confronted with data showing increasing global temperatures a huge research effort was launched which has shown that we are largely the cause. If the government response had been to rely on anecdotes about warm weather do you think anyone would have changed their minds and been motivated to take action?

0,"Well, first, it was selective leaks only from Democratic officials' email accounts. If the Russians or others hacked GOP official emails, we never saw them, purposely. They likely were every bit as personal and potentially embarrassing, but the intent was to swing public opinion against Democrats, of whom the Russians and our other enemies were more afraid.  Second, the Podesta and other Democratic emails weren't actually as horrible as the right wing noise machine twisted them into after going into hyper-distortion mode. I read them. What was the problem in them? Most people didn't read them, they just relied on the mischaracterizations of them by the right wing media and professional liars. Remember the Fox paid talking head analyst who claimed Hillary was a criminal and should go to jail? Well, after the election, it turned out Hillary wasn't a criminal but this Fox analyst was and is likely headed to the slammer.  Pay attention, American people.

0,"Sorry Canadians but this is an American domestic issue. Try and put aside your typical anti-Americanism and at least acknowledge that. Condolences to the Canadian victims but them being victims doesn’t make the American right to own guns the business of Canadians.  The fact is those on the left are rabidly, irrationally and hypocritically anti-gun. For example, left wing celebrities, politicians and those that are rich enough to have their own armed security don’t have a problem with guns when it comes to safeguarding themselves.  If this attack was done with a vehicle the left also wouldn't be calling for the banning of cars and trucks, and this attack could have been easily conducted with a high speed vehicle, just like in France, an attack that killed many more.  There  are many ways to injure and kill a lot people. The focus on guns is ignorant and irrantional. America has always had guns. Something else is broken is what is causing mass shootings. Anti-depressants, for example.

However, I have seen only one big brown bat this year, and their usual daytime roost, a collapsing barn, has none in it for two years now.  Maybe white nose syndrome?  Here along the Siuslaw River we have bees and wasps of all kinds, and lots of spiders.  I think the populations of birds and insects vary year-to-year and by locale.  At least, I hope so.  Honey bees probably suffer from varroa mites and other parasites, and are susceptible to infection when hives are moved around the country and into contact with infected colonies.  My orchard is crowded with bug-eating birds.  Let's work to ban neonicotinoid insecticides, which are cumulative and long-lasting poisons; and let's limit herbicide spraying to protect aquatic  phytoplankton, the base of the food chain for all aquatic insect nymphs.

0,"Of course, feminism is a social construct, formed in response to another social construct misogyny. I would not say that women in the US are oppressed, but they do suffer from discrimination.  There are many protections written into US law that inhibit discrimination against women, but still, discrimination does persist.  As the current president has so clearly demonstrated, assaults on women are considered perfectly fine by some; the victims of rape are routinely treated with far more suspicion than victims of other crimes; women have a far harder time getting elected; women receive less pay for the same work; there are still fields of work (STEM, for example) where women are not welcome and are subject to much overt discrimination.

Not easy tasks to be sure, even tougher than in Reagan's time, but if Trump keeps his eye on these two priorities (and successful tycoons tend to be good at focusing on priorities) then he will achieve a more proud, prosperous and united country as his legacy.

The just show up types are generally next.   It also happens in what passes for the private sector these days, but once you get past the obviously worthless ones, it becomes a much more subjective matter, and writing the right checks or sleeping in the right bed means a whole lot more in government.   What you describe is more true of small work units, even if they're a part of a big company.   I assure you a large corporation can contend with any government for inefficiency and general stupidity.   Big is generally bad, and the key to having a relatively efficient large organization is to have it divided into small and individually manageable work units.

Democrats support markets by regulating industries so that -- ideally -- they don't screw up so badly that there's demand that they be taken over by government completely. Democrats also support markets by demanding competition so they aren't dominated by monopolies. If you think Democrats don't support markets, consider that Republicans would have let the U.S. economy go bust in 2008-9.

If we fight these trends with business as usual policies -  ie pushing ever higher rates of growth -  rather than accommodating them, social chaos is certain.

The vast majority of people who are pro choice are not for voluntary late-term abortions.  The things that bother me more than cherry-picking boogeyman stories about rogue abortionists or careless sexuality is the combination of pro-life and anti-contraception. I think that everyone should try to ensure that people have access to contraception, sex education and reproductive health. Family planning should be a skill that everyone has.  Policy makers that try to limit access to sex education and contraception can all except an increase in abortions and the worse case scenarios when it comes to pregnancy. Ideally abortions only happen in extreme necessary cases.

However, during the campaign, the Liberals found many GVRD and Island supporters gravitating to the Greens out of (a) environmental concerns, (b) disenchantment with the Liberals and (c) a conclusion the Greens were a safe non-NDP option.  In the campaign’s closing days, by targeting thermal coal the Liberals are playing the nationalist and environmental cards to draw back traditional support in a way that they think will not turn off the Interior’s blue collar voters.

Also, it is very hard on women to go through an abortion, there is a psychological cost, an emotional cost to abortion.

Escalating rents means that they will not be able to afford anything larger, should they even find it.  Canada is not the  US, which has many large urban areas with affordable rentals. Should the present rate of border crossers continue, or increase - they will all be competing with each other (and residents) for housing.

But the New Mexico budget grew by nearly 5% under his leadership.  He told the Wall Street Journal that Social Security needs to be privatized, the retirement age increased, and benefits should be means tested.  He said in an interview that he'd cut everything in the federal budget by 43%, including Medicare and the military's ability to go on the offensive against our enemies.

(Guess he'd never heard a smoke detector go off)  He said he was charging a cellphone that was plugged into an extension cord.  Fire investigators said evidence included lighter fluid cylinders and a 9-inch MAPP gas cylinder.  When the fire started Rocket crawled to the front door He did not think to close the front door behind him.

As a rule, the details of how income from a specific business is taxed depend in part on the business’s legal form. More particularly, in most states corporations are subject to a corporate income tax, while income from “pass-through entities” such as S corporations, limited liability companies (LLCs), partnerships, and sole proprietorships is subject to a state’s tax on personal income.

On the opposite side, there are voices that are denying that our climate is changing.  Why not go the actual sources which document what is really happening (i.e NASA, NOAA, HadCRUT4, JMA)?

Third, many of the plans are so convoluted that few people benefit from all of them.

0,"""""What causes gentrification is rich people moving here. """"  Nope. It's the uncontrolled housing market that causes gentrification. As neighborhoods become more desirable, the market allows rich people to compete amongst each other and drive prices up. They are also able to privately capture the value that is added with things like infrastructure improvements, even though those things are publicly funded. But it's possible to control this with things like Community Land Trusts. Rich people are only able to drive up prices because our uncontrolled, private market, that treats housing as just another commodity rather than a human right, allows it.  Sustainable living for the rich, while everybody else gets pushed to the suburbs, is not Climate Justice. It's actually a grave injustice to all the people who want to live in a sustainable Portland but are basically being told they don't deserve to because they don't make enough money. Fix that and people might get on board with development.

0,"""""Prisons see drop in solitary confinement use as vulnerable groups granted immunity.""""  Vulnerable groups, such as the mentally ill and pregnant women, are NOT granted immunity from solitary confinement.. All that's happened is that Corrections Canada now has a new """"policy"""" in place. It's the same as any employer having a policy in place, but one which it isn't obligated to follow due to law or labor contract. That policy may be there later today, or it may not. The policy may be followed, or it may not.  The Liberals could have easily included the policy's provisions in its recent legislative changes. The obvious reason why they didn't is because Corrections Canada intends to violate the policy, at least in some cases. So it's virtually assured that the mentally ill, pregnant women and other vulnerable inmates will still be sent to solitary confinement.  I applaud the BC Civil Liberties Association and the John Howard Society for continuing to challenge this inhumane practice.

I doubt if the top 1% is paying their full tax rate, on that we agree. They can afford to buy an army of tax accountants and lawyers to get them out of paying their full share of taxes.

0,"Seward has a little known Rockwell Kent gem in it's museum. It is a portrait of the daughter of a well known Seward business man. The owner of Brown and Hawkins mercantile grub staked Kent and got the painting in return. He painted it while living in an abandoned cabin on Fox Island. It is quite good and unusual for Kent since it is realistic, in normal not garish colors and is not stylized as many of his words are. It is painted on a piece of c.1918 plywood. I would describe it as being Seward's """"Mona Lisa"""" because the girl, Virginia Darling, is in the same basic pose as DaVinci's famous woman.  My own favorite Kent works are the illustrations he did while living in Greenland. They too are realistic portraits. Most people don't know it but Kent is famous and well beloved in the former Soviet Union whose museums have lots of his stuff. He was a outspoken Socialist and was into the """"workers of the world unite thing"""". Stalin played him like a fiddle.

All the ACA did was regulate what had to be covered in policies. They didn't tell insurance companies how to run their business or who they had to ensure.  And, in point of fact, you could keep your doctor and you could stay with your insurance company if you wanted to.  Many plans - pre and post ACA - provide for choosing an in network or an out of network doctor. If you choose an out of network doctor, you pay a little more. Or you could choose to go without a group plan and get a policy for yourself.  All this whining from people who constantly tout self-reliance and responsibility but rarely exhibit it is ludicrous.

The First Amendment states: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Here, the library, part  of the State isn't prohibiting  porn in an individual's private life, it just will not provide the free wifi.  For example, the State cannot prohibit all strip joints; it can zone where strip joints are located due to secondary effects.  Similar to strip joints; liquor stores;bars the State has a interest in zoning where these are located. By analogy,  the State doesn't have to supply  strippers or alcohol or free porn.

Manafort is dangerous for Trump because he is likely to know of Trump's financial connections to the Russian oligarchs that go back to the time when both were taking advantage of those relationships (with oligarchs that officed in Trump tower and lived in Trump's Florida apartments).

Plastics, fertilizers, etc are major consumers of oil also, and there is no replacement in either sector. The North Slope infrastructure is developed and that sunk cost can produce in excess of 2 MILLION barrels per day. Given today's low rate of 500,000 barrels, the marginal cost of drilling is quite low, given the remarkable production of North Slope wells, commonly over 5,000 bpd, far outstripping wells in the lower 48, typically @ 100's bpd. The key is pipelines to the new discoveries and that is the immediate, major cost. The Trump administration would do well to sponsor new PIPELINE development on the Slope, with those pipelines earning the PPP their payback. Develop pipelines NOW!

Hickel used to secure our statehood might gather enough support in Congress to amend Obama's irresponsible action. Look around. We've already lost thousands of jobs. How many businesses can you count that have closed? Alaskans don't want a handout. We just want the same freedom that all the rest of the states in our union have in order to build a future for ourselves, our children and our children's children.

For people to be in this shape is not the current system's fault but the birth and raising of the people in trouble and it will get worse. This is a problem that can't be solved by enough beds to let them all soil. Forever there have been people living under the bridges and donations and once clean rooms won't change it, just enable it. To the people that are working to solve the problem we must congratulate and the people donating their excess it is a noble thing to do but the problem will never go away until the causes go away. You have stores selling booze, people selling drugs, people that will never have the mental capability to cope for one reason or another, To be honest people that shouldn't be here, children farms, like puppy farms, enabled by the government, people raising a bunch of weeds rather than one flower. Money thrown at the problem won't solve it.

It's a child's view of life, particularly attractive to millennials who have been raised on this stuff.  And that's what Trudeau gets.  Conservatives and conservatives have a more mature view of human nature, that we are each capable of doing good or doing evil, and so have a more guarded view of human possibilities - that society is more nuanced than just sunny days, parades and ever-harmonious """"diversity"""".

The problem is the failure of to act on those plans. The most important reason is an alarming loss of appropriately experienced managerial and technical capacity. Most top managers in DWS are deployees shipped in from outside who have little clue about what they are doing. They cannot even lean on the managers under them, because they too are in the same boat. Hence vital decisions are delayed interminably by hesitant managers who lack either the essential engineering training or managerial experience that can only be acquired through hard work learning the ropes while rising through the ranks of the organisation. Sadly many of these top managers will never gain the required experience or training, no matter how smart they may be. Hence my emphasis on the need for APPROPRIATE experience.

Add new technologies intersecting with materials' science, and we don't have a substantial domestic workforce anymore. We have a 'just in time' or gig economy.

Add 300,000 new immigrants ... plus refugees. House prices UP, UP --  Canada must identify what it can do best instead of selling out to other nations.

But what about the plain old basic middle class that isn't too far removed from living paycheck to paycheck? They get shouldered with the burden to pay for this too, but little thought goes into what their financial liabilities are, nobody really seems to care if higher taxes or insurance premiums causes any trouble for this group. Why should these families suffer just so somebody else can get free healthcare? Every debate about this issue boils down to rich vs poor, but what about those caught in the middle? It's not morally wrong to want to keep the little bit of excess income one has left over after paying bills, but it is morally wrong to force someone to give that money to others. In fact it's called theft.

Counter-intuitively, the report concludes that Cape Town has the lowest level of poverty, the lowest level of inequality, and the second lowest youth unemployment of any city in the country.  So this cannot be the explanation. Instead the report argues that “an answer may lie in the disproportionate access to alcohol, drugs and firearms” in CT, and concludes that policies to reduce crime should focus on these things""""  The first point to note is that the indicator name is misleading. It says access, but what it measures is the detection of crimes where AD&F were recorded. This means that based on these numbers one cannot actually claim that access in CT is any different to say Joburg. Furthermore, the researchers point out that detection methods for AD&F may be different and so results here should be treated with caution.

(JPII changed everything, including the makeup of the hierarchy.) The US Bishops' pastoral letter responding to HV, 'Human Life in Our Day', was a moderate affirmation both of the teaching of HV and of the conscience rights of married couples. There were many priests who wrestled with HV as confessors, and many bishops who tried conscientiously to help them do it. I knew one very conservative priest who left ministry because he thought HV was wrong, but he could see no wiggle room for himself as a confessor. Many people remember or know about Cardinal O'Boyle's confrontation with the Catholic University theologians. I don't think O'Boyle was representative of the US hierarchy. I think it's important to note that he was acting not as Archbishop of Washington but as Chancellor of the University.

0,"The fact that people can come forward decades later is one of the biggest problems. I'm ok with it in the case of children because I think it is entirely legitimate for them to take years to precess what happened and then get to a state where they can make a complaint. But not for adults. IF something happens to you when you are an adult you need to take responsibility for dealing with it when it happens. The Ghomeshi case was a perfect example of why it is a problem. And sorry but any assault serious enough to put someone in jail for is something clear enough that you shouldn't be going back over and and over again for more. Again the Ghomeshi case is a perfect example. If it didn't bother you enough to do something about it at the time then 10 years later, too bad. Exceptions of course for people who are more or less trapped in an abusive relationship. The accusers all committed perjury - why were they not charged? No wonder men are worried.

0,"Trudeau and the Liberals for as an yet unknown reason desperately want a seat on the U.N.'s Security Council. To that end they have done everything possible to gain the attention of the U.N. with suitable gestures and of course large sums of money to be spread around on various U.N. sanctioned causes.  The mission to Mali or some other African country is one of those gestures. There is a very real likelihood that some of our troops will either be injured or die, as this will be peacekeeping. When the unfortunate does happen, I hope that enough people will remind Trudeau of the price that was paid in order to get  the dubious seat on a U.N. Council.

0,"Yakabuski demonstrates yet again the vast gulf between the beliefs and wishes and values of ordinary Canadians, and the apparatchiks of the mainstream media and politicians, who march in lockstep in their devotion to multiculturalism and wide open immigration.  Most Canadians see it as only common sense that if you're bringing in immigrants from, say Pakistan or Afghanistan, where 90% of the people have told polls that they want Sharia law, believe in stoning women for adultery, and believe in executing anyone who blasphemes, that we have a little discussion with the potential immigrants first to find out just how severe their repressive religious tendencies and values are.  They don't just abandon these values once they hit our shores, after all. The polls have shown three quarters of Canadians want values testing, yet the major media remains united in their frantic condemnation of the very idea. How DARE we consider that our values might in some slight way be superior!?

0,"akchrissy- No taxation occurred, just the reduction of a gift that the State can no longer afford to give, at least under the old PFD formula.  That money belongs to the State (us collectively rather than individually) and has a higher purpose (paying for the cost of government that we collectively demand) than being gifted to residents.  Regardless of whether we feel entitled to it or not, and whether or not we have become dependent on it.  The money is needed to continue to provide a State government for the children.  I personally feel that we would be better off without a PFD check going forward, but I could see a benefit if a PFD check was determined by the expense of government.  It might help to control boondoggles and wasteful spending, but there would be some that would also call on the State to not provide any government or pay its debts and liabilities in order that their check could be bigger.

0,"Socialism is a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole. In order to achieve this any enterprise associated with the means of production, distribution and exchange, virtually all enterprise, would have to be forcibly taken over by the socialist state, stolen or bought at a rate set by the socialist state, again stolen. Democracy permits this but in fact the ownership, the power is invested in elected ideologues. Theft is theft whether committed by a single person or a democratic majority. These principles of socialism, however, much or little they are applied validate every piece of legislation from the Democratic Socialist governments of Western Europe to the Communist regime in N Korea style.

0,"Correct. Neither JP II nor B XVI enthusiastically embraced V II's  teachings about their brother bishops. Senior bishops internationally began to avoid participation in synods because they were seen to be rote and boring. (I have this """"from the horse's moth"""")  Bishops were given minimal time to make presentations. JP II is reported to have read his breviary during many of the sessions.  JPII's disdain for the views of his brother bishops is evidenced in his pronouncement against women priests without any significant consultation whatsoever, neither from bishops nor from laity.  Bishops' conferences that should have been taking the lead on local matters held back in case of offending Rome. E.g: During the AIDS crisis in Southern African, while hundreds of thousands of people were dying, bishops remained silent instead of commending the use of condoms --- even as an emergency measure

If that's you, it's just another decision to buy consumables such as a vacation, expensive clothes, etc. If that's not you, you're spending money you can't afford (check your TFSA).  NEVER finance a vehicle. In the $13,000 car example, much better off to buy a $3000 vehicle, and SAVE the rest you would have spent on car payments until you can ladder up to something better.  PS. There is no such thing as 0% financing, and all the 'discounted' rates you see for new car financing are a lie. The government should compel car financiers to disclose the true cost, which is the interest, PLUS the premium you paid for the car by not purchasing with cash.  And if you want to see what cars are really worth, go to a car auction. They are in most major cities (eg. Adesa in Vancouver), it is how used dealers dispose of cars they don't want when you trade-in. The most disturbing fact is how little luxury cars sell for.

According to the US Census, the average 90 yr old person has a 4.8 yr additional life expectancy.  That would mean that there would be about a 50 - 50 chance that she would die while still in office.   And who knows how disabled she might become even before that.

0,"Nothing more absurd than someone who bases their arguments via semantics coupled with a clear lack of understanding themselves of the Constitution and our history.  Let's pick the lowest hanging fruit from the tree...the 19th Amendment passed by Congress June 4, 1919, and ratified on August 18, 1920(by the States...not SCOTUS) gave women the RIGHT to vote(I am pretty sure God approved their """"right"""" to vote long before 1920).  Similarily the Voting RIGHTS Act of 1965 was a federal piece of legislation signed into law by President Johnson. In fact, as initially ratified, the Constitution allowed each state complete discretion to determine voter qualifications for its residents.  Have legislation / laws been upheld or struck down by the Supreme Court? Of course.  But to suggest voting RIGHTS cannot be granted by government is not historically accurate. It may be a privilege to live in this country but it is a RIGHT to vote thanks to what has been legislated into the Constitution.

For example, there is no requirement for Uber/Lyft drivers to have an Alaska driver's license! No requirement for their car to be registered in Alaska! There's no provision for Workmen's Compensation for the drivers!  And to top it all off, the bill is utterly toothless, as the Finance Committee stripped out all the language allowing the Dept. of Commerce to do anything. So, sure, there's a requirement for insurance on the vehicle, etc, but there's nothing behind that requirement. No insurance? No problem.

IF you retire, you may continue to get your same health insurance, but ONLY if you pay the premiums in full. It's not subsidized. For that reason, many of my State co-workers are  waiting to retire until they are eligible for Medicare.  Secondly, the funds go into the general fund. PERS payments will occur with or without passage of this, so the question is how much of PERS do you want to pay versus the largest companies in Oregon. Their share of taxes has only gone down in recent decades, not up.  Third: retirement at 50 was only for police and fire workers, for Tier 1. I was hired by the state in 2006.

0,"If the steele dossier was fake, which is what trump claims, and it was produced by Fusion, also claimed by Hannity, and that allegation that the steele dossier is fake is being used against the democrats as if they have been relying on inaccurate data on trump, why would anyone assume that fusion is on the democrats side? I'm not saying the dossier is fake, fox news seems to be the only people talking about this dossier. I don't recall their being any evidence that the dossier is being used by anyone to prove anything about the gop or trump specifically. There is more than enough evidence to warrant the highest level of scrutiny directed at trump and his staff.

0,"When the original NAFTA negotiations took place, the energy file was left off the table, according to my cousin, a senator at the time from Toronto's Spadina Riding. This could be included in the forthcoming negotiations with the U.S., as it would be to Canada's advantage, which is of course the reason it was left off the table in the first place.  As for the marketing boards, the Americans have a lot of Canadians on their side because  it is outrageous that dairy farmers appear to control our political processes, as in stealing the Conservative nomination from a free trader, and as in stealing food from children whose parents can't afford the unjustifiably high prices for dairy and poultry.

1,"Not all populist movements are created equal. Anger is the lifeblood of the Trump base and he continually stokes that anger. He may not be overtly racist (that's debatable), but he certainly has done nothing to discourage racism among his supporters. Trump is a coward and an opportunist who refuses to call out even the most egregious offenders within his base.  I don't know how to heal the deep divisions in the body politic, or even that they can be healed, but I do know that it will never happen as long as the two sides continue to demonize each other. When Trump stops his name-calling and his belittling Tweets and starts acting like a statesman, then maybe I'll start believing he's interested in healing division.

If Trump had only called the widow, said he did his best, and was sorry it didn't come out as he intended all would be fine. However, child that he is, he instead attacked the congresswoman and the widow, making the situation far worse just as his big mouth has has exacerbated other situations, including the NFL protests, Iran, and North Korea.

0,"Property rights vs zoning restrictions is the interesting debate.  Personally I think we would see more efficiency, affordability, property rights, and economic growth if the state adopted something like the Japanese Model. If it is a transit oriented development area, I would imagine in the future it will get built. TOD's are the best place to urbanize to protect single family areas from up zoning.  Housing issues often come down to a conflict of political principle vs self interest. Self interest usually wins but is shows political hypocrisy on all sides.  Democrats who oppose development due to zoning are supporting a racist policy that negatively impact minorities, the poor, and the middle class. That history is well establish, the economic impacts are well documented.  Republicans who oppose development are opposing property rights, a cornerstone of the conservative doctrine.

In as short a period as my own lifetime, we've seen bishops squander generations, perhaps centuries of trust.  It's not that every one of them was a """"Cardinal Law"""" kind of poster boy on the issue of abuse.  Rather, it's that each and every one of them has a voice, and just about all of them have chosen to remain silent in the face of one of the most heinous institutional coverups in history.  It's become clear that their understanding of married life, and especially that sacrament of children, leaves a great deal to be desired.  As presumably celibate men, that's somewhat understandable.  That they refuse the counsel of the married laity, the counsel of the parents of these children, the counsel of the abused themselves; THAT's where the problem lies.  Respect must be earned.  Deference must be deserved.

The trade to the Knicks and then his addictions held him back, leading to him getting suspended by Pat Riley when he was with the Lakers.  Sadly, like Thompson, it led to a premature demise.

0,"Part 3 The practice of reserving the Eucharist is ancient, but the place of reservation was a cupboard in the sacristy, and the purpose of the reservation was to have the Eucharist available to take to the sick and dying. It absolutely did non occur to anyone in those early days to expose the Eucharist for adoration. It was meant to be eaten and drunk.  In the fifty years before V2, the ancient practice of regular communion was revived. People were slow to adopt this revised Eucharistic theology. The V2 liturgical revisions had many objectives, but one of these was to accelerate this return to the understanding of the Eucharist PRIMARILY as sacred food; and as part of that process, the altar became once again a table, a direct symbolic replacement for the dinner table at the Last Supper, and with it the tabernacle got displaced in various ways in different churches.  It took 50 years to re-institute regular communion; it will take longer to re-conceive why we reserve the Eucharist.

Just you might shrug off the cumulative effect of $5 for coffee, you shrug off that $5,000 option on your car because it only added $80 to the  monthly payment.  For many people the cumulative effect of all these """"inconsequential"""" expenses is what gets them in debt trouble or at least leaves them minimal savings.

I disagree with the learned professor that the answer to this problem lies in more religion. I prefer Trevor Phillips conclusion, which is that schools should be more integrated, allowing children to mix with and understand each other better. He suggests that no one school should have more than 50% Muslims, which seems achievable since the Muslim population in Britain is around 7%.  He also has other sensible proposals regarding supervision of the Sharia system in Britain.

It's a good start but still too many stations.  It would be good to add an express service on top of that serving limited stations.  I imagine the Boeing Plant station will be a destination for many.  Is Boeing contributing anything to this?  Especially land and funding for the station at their location?  Big employers should be required to contribute to mass transit solutions for their workers.  Microsoft set a good example with their Connector service!  w.r.t the 164th street station concern, they need to build the station closer to where the people and the parking will be.

Yet there's been no concerted outcry by feminists against the violations. Have they been too busy all that time to speak out?  Let's call a spade a spade. The failure of feminists to address this particular rights abuse is a result of the rigidity of present-day feminism. It constrains women, just like the patriarchy does. At best, women outside the accepted norms of feminist ideology are shunned or patronized. At worst, those women will watch as feminists actively call for their fundamental rights to be violated.

0,"The 2% figure is based on OPEC sleight of hand. The real number is closer to 1%, and with likely cheating will be below that.  While the OPEC claim that it will cut production by 1.2 mb/d is accurate, what is not getting reported much is that 700,000 mb/d of that came from Indonesia leaving the organization, and most of the remainder is coming from Saudi Arabia.  However, the Indonesian barrels don't  disappear from world oil production, they are just shifted from the OPEC column to the non-OPEC column. So the real reduction in world production from OPEC agreement is about 500,000 mb/d. Add the additional 550,000 or so from the weekend agreement with Russia, and that gives just over 1 mb/d in actual cuts to world production.  That's about 1% of the 80 mb/d in world production, about half of your estimate - if no one cheats.

0,"What's the big rush to pass Trump's """"cut, cut, cut"""" tax bill?  The result of the rush job is that it will look like the Beverly Hillbillies jalopy.  Who is having input into making the """"cut, cut, cut"""" sausage in Paul Ryan's Republican caucus?  I see no CBO scoring of this thing.   As a matter of fact a lot of businesses are against outline of the """"cut, cut, cut"""" Trump bill including the housing industry.  Who doesn't want to see their tax deduction for their home disappear?  How about that child tax credit for individuals and families ballyhooed by Ryan and Republicans?  Well they manage to put in a income cut off point for individuals which is 18,000/year and families at 24,000/year.  That means the expanded child credit does not benefit anyone below those income levels.  https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/child-tax-credit-increases-in-gop-tax-plan-exclude-millions-of-children-in-low  What a deal for Americans when child care can easily reach ten thousand dollars per year!

0,"I think the four cardinals genuinely believe that they are rendering a service to the church. I recognize their sincerity and their love for the church. Moreover, their questions represent the thinking of other members of the church.  However, I think it is a mistake to think that Pope Francis has not answered the cardinals. His silence IS the answer. Quod scripsit, scripsit. Much ink has been spilled, many words have been expended (not a few by Francis himself), commenting on 'Amoris laetitia'. Francis has endorsed the response of the bishops of Argentina. He need say nothing more; he ought to say nothing more. In the end, these four cardinals do not seek clarification; they demand capitulation. Francis can’t, won’t and shouldn't do that.

You know, we have this huge country of 330 million people, and two much smaller ones as neighbors for more than 2 centuries. However, Canada and Mexico have copied nothing, followed nothing from the Yanks. Not even a reverse invasion after being invaded. Cultures remain completely distinct, economic and financial systems similar principles but vastly different in institutions and operations. Societal values very different (e.g. health care).

This is about Trump discrediting  and insulting EVERYONE who disagrees with him on anything.  For him to attack the talent of a world-renowned actress is therefore not surprising.  This is not about the Polanski affair.  You don't have all the facts; none of us here have them.  I think it's best to stay focused on what matters here today, i.e. whether or not Trump is once again making a total fool of himself on the domestic and international fronts.  To me, the answer is pretty clear.  If Meryl Streep is wrong about Polanski, and that's a big if, this would mean at worse that her judgment is fatally flawed -- a negative trait that is not exclusive to movie stars, as one can see here.  Yet, to deny that she rates among the best actors in the world is simply wilful blindness.

Nowadays it's the opposite, with Dems wanting bigger govt (more control) and the pubbies are against it because the Democratic welfare programs keep poor African Americans on the Democratic plantation.  Indeed, history repeats itself in the pro-slavery Democratic Party and the anti-slavery Republican Party.

Seems that to some cutting taxes is the be-all and end-all but how is that realistic in a growing city that has serious revenue problems in being able to cope with need for improved infrastructure?  This clown promised to build ten billion dollars worth of subways and really had no plan to pay for it beyond going to Ottawa or Queen's Park for the funding to do so.  Or how about his asinine proposal to build a Ferris wheel and sail-in hotel on the waterfront? The real problem Toronto has with its politics today is a dearth of solid candidates willing to come forward to run for council or Mayor and when a Ford is presented as a 'sensible' alternative you know you've hit rock bottom.

As someone who has studied economics, I must say it does not appear that you have studied even rudimentary economics. For example, if you lump the Austrian School and Libertarianism together with each other, and then together with free market fundamentalism, your sources are perhaps something like an Anarchist FAQ. Maybe try some first hand sources so you at least have a basic comprehension of what you are dismissing off the cuff?  Austrian Economics does not reject empiricism at all. If you were familiar with mathematics, you would see a similar methodology than what is applied in mathematics in Austrian Economics. That is if and when you decide to educate yourself on these topics.
