0,"I am NOT a fan at all nor think it this smart public policy for Christy - on the eve of a BC election no less -  to  commit the use of public taxpayer dollars for loans to first time BC home buyers least able to afford the huge debt obligation that comes with a frigging 5% down """"high ratio"""" mortgage!   In fact. I would strongly argue/suggest/promote the further strengthening and enhancement of the already existing BC First Time Home Buyers Program at http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/property-taxes/property-transfer-tax/understand/first-time-home-buyers AND the BC Home Owner Grant Program at http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/property-taxes/annual-property-tax/reduce/home-owner-grant, that would not only be beneficial to first time buyers but also those seniors and retirees on fixed incomes facing up to a 30%  increase in property assessments!!!

0,"The rise of Trump is the result of Bush legacy, and Obama policy. The win of Trump is the result of Hillary own failures and Obama supporting the wrong candidate. But according to Russian president Putin, if only he had the power to hack U.S. elections then America would be spared 8 years of Obama tragedy. If is unfortunate that he was accused of having this amazing power only AFTER the election of Trump!

0,"Regardless of the merits of the Juneau road project, one fact sticks out.  DOT has consistently underestimated its costs, and has been very slow to update cost projections for construction and maintenance of the road.  First of all, the last DOT cost estimate for the project, which is already obsolete, was $574 million, not the $552 million in the op-ed.  $22 million may be chump change to some, but not to me.  Second, at one time during the project """"planning,"""" the cost of ferries dedicated to run between the end of the new road and Haines and Skagway were appropriately included in the project costs.  Then, when the Alaska Class ferry was initially designed to be able to serve the entire AMHS service area, the ferry costs were deleted. Then a re-design occurred, and the new ferries will be Juneau Access day boats only; their costs have never been added back to the project, however.  Bottom line: It is closer to a $1 billion project in today's dollars.

0,"This couple could easily simplify its situation by paying off all its debts now since they have the money. Assuming that Mike's job is secure paying off debt should be a priority. They will have an extra $400 a month to save/spend.  There may be some room for improvement with their expenses, too. Some points:  Property taxs look high relative to the value of their home, even if the valuation given is out of date. Maybe this covers other items?  $250 per month to charity? From what I read the average person in Canada gives about  $300 per year and that includes the uber rich who give really big sums. Their generosity is admirable but charity begins at home.  Gardening at $175 per month? They should be able to cut this way back. Weeds require no maintenance.  This couple is doing reasonably well overall and should consider itself fortunate, even if it cannot indulge like others do. Likely those others are living on debt.

Almost daily, one or another of them would go on a tirade against Obama, the Clintons, the Dems or some aspect of society that they blamed on progressives.  I sat there and tended to my knitting because I valued my job.  But I was happy to move on to a large corporation with a strong commitment to workplace diversity, equal opportunity and minority empowerment.  Now I work with immigrants from many nations and the workplace chatter is much more interesting and tolerable.  This woofer needs to find an employer whose views match his.

0,"The bigger problem is an opportunity gap for our kids, boys and girls. A lot of the hockey associations are run by a very small group of individuals that run the associations so that their kids and their friends all play on the same upper echelon team. It does not matter how much money for lessons and training camps you send your kids to, you won't be given an opportunity to play up unless you break in with this small clique. The team selections are mostly predetermined before the """"open tryout"""" takes place. It's such a shame. It happens all over Canada and pathetically so in southwestern Ontario too. So sad for the kids and parents who are effectively bullied and not provided a fair opportunity.

0,"lol, nothing like in-state rivalry, but yes things go too far, and someone claiming their neutral by (wink, wink) claiming they """"support both teams"""" but their kids are wearing CSU shirts and get (gulp!) """"verbally accosted!"""" should look inward, and realize. . it's just a sporting event.  We have two of the best university's in the nation in CU and CSU, and rivalries are healthy more than they are a real public danger.  OK, one team lost, get over it, move on, make excuses why your team lost, but don't start blaming the fans/students for your frustration.  I'd hate to see this event cancelled because of disruptive fans, but as long as we get into this tit-for-tat argument, which fans are more """"verbally abusive"""" things will head south.  I'll never forget 25 years ago, returning to my home state of Iowa to watch my """"dance with the one that brung ya"""" Buffaloes take on my childhood favorite Hawkeyes.

If a membership doubled at M.L., then that was a business decision which nobody who doesn't want to pay it isn't made to.  No tax dollars are being spent to bump up membership prices!

0,"""""Flee sexual immorality."""" 1Corinthians 6:12 - 7:7 is the full passage, but that verse pretty much sums it up. In the Greek, that verb is very strong. It means """"run as fast as you can away from it.""""  Christians are to avoid sin in all forms, but especially sexual immorality because of how it affects people at a deeper level than other sins. There are 5 other passages in the Bible clearly stating that God includes homosexuality among the sexual sins.  It's pretty much impossible to participate in a same-sex wedding and not be seen as approving of the lifestyle it symbolizes. In participating, Christians not only negate their own witness in all other areas of morality, but they also hold the entire gospel up to ridicule. Why should anyone believe our faith message if our lifestyles are steeped in sin? The idea that we're not guilty of sin when we only condone it and are to doing the actual deed is a compromise with sin that you will not find anywhere in Scripture.
"
0,"We won't eliminate all CO2.  The goal is to stabilize CO2 at current levels, or maybe someday reduce levels slightly.  Nothing is inherently pollution.  Only when a substances exceeds its natural or desired level in the environment is it called pollution (or called poison when it's within a biological being).

0,"“Under Mr. Harper, there were so many people who were unhappy with the government and his approach that people said, ‘We need electoral reform in order to stop having governments we don’t like,’ ” Mr. Trudeau told the newspaper in French. “However, under the current system, they now have a government with which they are more satisfied. And the thirst to change the electoral system is less striking.”  And here I thought the objection to first-past- the-post had something to do with the principle that elected legislatures should represent the will of the people. The quotation from Mr Trudeau should be sent off to every university in the land for discussion in first year political theory classes. I suspect the results might be a shock for Mr. Trudeau.
"
0,"I think the primary reason that dual citizens like Jones and Bee hold on to their Canadian citizenship is that it costs them absolutely nothing and, if they get seriously ill, they can come back to Canada for free health care for the rest of their lives. (True story.  A female Quebecker went to Los Angeles to work in the porn industry. Can't remember if she became a U.S. citizen, but believe she did.  After many years in the business, she contracted HIV and came back to Canada for free, but expensive for the taxpayer, health care for the rest of her life). I like the U.S. approach.  If you want to remain a U.S. citizen and you are residing out of the U.S., you must file a U.S. tax return every year and pay U.S. taxes unless you are in a country with which the U.S. has a tax treaty.  Canada should adopt this approach - good for taxpayers in Canada and forces dual citizens to assess how much Canada really means to them

0,"I am disappointed that Rich decided to step down. He has been a voice for moderation and calm within the OCC at a time when the organization is being forced to deal with decisions which would benefit from his sense of fairness.  The Democratic Party has Rules which require the wisdom of Solomon to administer fairly. Sadly, Solomon lost his election bid to the OCC.  Chelsea Kent's finger angered a lot of Democrats, some already annoyed that Kent and other Bernie activists had spanked the Clinton camp so badly in the March caucuses. Kent was stripped of her credentials in Philly, which was the proper and proportionate response. But that has not satisfied some of her more hostile opponents.  DPH Rules provide no basis for disciplining Chelsea any further for her finger action. That has not stopped creative minds in the Hawaiian Affairs Caucus from stretching and contorting the Rules in their drive to expel her. Rich, and other party officers, are caught in the uncomfortable middle.

Regardless of whether you like what they're protesting or not, they have the right to protest whatever they want. Trump is a National Disgrace."""" Let's be clear. 1.) They ARE SOB's for disrespecting dead soldiers & their families who have lost them. If you disagree, then take the time to ask their families who have lost someone. Ask Taya Kyle (Chris Kyle's wife). I'm sure she'd love to set you straight. 2.) No, they do not have the right to protest whatever they want. Would you protest for the unfair treatment of pedophiles? Of course not. Having the right to protest, doesn't mean you SHOULD. If you are going to protest police brutality, then use the correct forum. Not the Anthem. It borders, IMHO, on treason. It is rude and disrespectful and unless you missed it, America doesn't like it. Unless you are Antifa, of course.

0,"Larry Asher - Therein lies the problem. You are assuming that everything your favorite media outlet reports about President Trump (or anyone else) is """"fact-based"""" and trustworthy, when in fact, if you listened to a variety of media sources rather than just the ones you like, you'd learn that there's a great deal more to some stories (not just about President Trump) that your preferred, supposedly trustworthy media leaves out in an attempt to slant public opinion in their favor.  Yes, journalists should be balanced, but I used to be one and I can tell you that most of them were incapable of separating their personal opinion from their coverage of the news. Personally, I would record events so I could go back and mine the stuff that I didn't think was important when I was taking notes, so I saw the bias even in myself ... I just simply tried not to act upon it. Unfortunately, most of my colleagues were more self-assured in their own intelligence and the rightness of their opinions.

0,"I have wished there could be an actual in-person debate by the mayoral candidates so that the knowledge and ability to think on the fly could be demonstrated to the voting public.  This written format allows ghost writers to answer for Baxley in order to make her sound much more knowledgable than she actually is.  Having heard Baxley comment at Council meetings I can guarentee she did not write a single word attributed to her in this article.  Aside from all the flat out misrepresentations and lies about the current mayor. The Baxley debate stand-in makes it appear as though the mayor is getting paid the wage of the City Administrator and thereby costing us tons of money.  The mayor is saving money because she only gets paid around $12k/year.  Over spending the budget by $4m is such a lie and no proof has ever been brought forward to substantiate this claim.  Had this debate been live, Baxley's answers would have been much shorter and far less intelligent sounding.

0,"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/22/how-the-war-on-science-is-really-fought.html  Please read the full article.  1) Disregarding science: Without regard to the evidence of their effectiveness, the EPA has proposed eliminating or freezing anti-smog rules, power plant regulations, fracking regulations, mining pollution rules, even the popular Energy Star program. The unproven assertion that these regulations cost jobs has taken precedent over the evidence-based impacts that the regulations have. Science has taken a back seat to “jobs,” itself a euphemism for profits.  2) Disregarding the scientific method: It’s not just the content of science that Pruitt’s EPA is casting aside; it’s the scientific method itself, which relies on evidence, skepticism, peer review, observable facts, and as much independence from opinion as possible. The era of “alternative facts” flies in the face of everything science stands for. Continued below.....

The story also failed to cover the reason why we need to replace the courthouse and the 1981 legislative action that mandates that county governments provide adequate facilities for the district courts while the State provides the operational funding for them.  It also did not cover the values the Commissioners adopted for the project of accountability, transparency, collaboration and stewardship.

0,"I have been quite impressed with Jane Philpott as heath minister.  She will do a good job in her new role.  I think everyone agrees we need to put an end to the Indian Act.  The question is, what direction do we go in next?  “Nation to nation” is absolutely the wrong direction.  There are 600 separate indigenous groups in Canada.  Treating each one of these groups as a separate nation equal in status to Canada is ridiculous.  Are these indigenous people Canadians or not?  If they are then they should be integrated into the rest of Canadian society.  Doing anything else is racist and doesn’t really change the Indian Act.  Integration should include equal health care and education, property ownership and accountability.  We don’t need 600 third world oligarchies operating within the borders of Canada.  Again, it is racist and is contrary to basic Canadian human rights.

0,"I love this BS in the news comparing the moves of other organizations with the lack of moves in Denver, so let me spell it out for Kiszla, who I swear is getting more and more senile by the day.  1) Denver was not going to trade for Garropolo. They don't need a QB from New England, nor anyone else from New England for that matter. Jimmy only has slightly more live game experience than Paxton Lynch.  2) Denver was not going to trade for Duane Brown for two reasons. One: They don't have the space to pay his salary. Two: Denver needs a RIGHT TACKLE, not a left tackle. Bringing in Brown would have replaced Bolles because neither has played on the Right side in their life and Bolles is actually decent for a rookie. It's too bad most of the good RTs out there play for good teams who don't want to let them go.  I agree Trevor has issues, but the offensive line has more issues.

In any event the clock is ticking now since the appropriation law passed recently.  Apparently the Governor believes that he can somehow line item veto all the money for wages except for that next 30 days before the notices must be sent.  Political backlash notwithstanding, good luck with the logistics of that tactic just in the timing and having then to recall the legislature to appropriate the money back  that he vetoed. So then he hires an outsider for that ungodly amount of money while wanting all Alaskans to accept a 50% cut in these recently large dividend amounts.  Finally, he tips his hand by even talking about not wanting all his legislation this session. The Governor may have no """"swing"""" left.

The Navy is here to provide for the defense of the US, not to support Oak Harbor businesses who see the service people there as a market People are not being anti-military and unpatriotic if they feel a change in the jet noise pattern may suggest the Navy should move some of its operations elsewhere. As bad of news that would be for the Oak Harbor economy, the local economy's vitality isn't the reason we all American taxpayers are paying for this.

In most of the areas of the country in which refugees, like other immigrants, are most likely to permanently settle, and especially the Toronto and Vancouver regions, there's already stiff competition for scarce resources, and particularly for affordable housing.

It is up to the reader to decide which view is correct. I prefer to read the Passion narratives as one. It allows for a fresh perspective which goes beyond the Hebrew canon.  All of the protagonists save one, Jesus, forgot about the Resurrection and even Jesus did so for that one brief moment after he told his mother that he was dead to her and his disciple that he should care for Mary rather than make new disciples. That moment of despair allowed him to feel our hopelessness so that we can bring it to him for our salvation. We are all at the cross, every day of our lives.

Which I doubt. How to weigh  the gravity of these two offenses?  The alleged pedophile, a teacher and role model,  has definitely  damaged  the life of a  young girl, possibly even for life.  It added up to a charge of 11 felonies. As bad as this is by comparison, it doesn't let Crouch off the hook just because her  alleged offenses were less serious --  Remember she and her apparently drunk friends got kicked out of the theater for causing a problem, she was warned fairly by the cop not to drive, she did it anyway and got her DUI, and apparently had cocaine and maybe LSD  as well.  She is fortunate the cops stopped her before she had a wreck and maybe killed someone. This is WAY more than your """"drink and a toot."""" I like the principal's letter, poor guy!

0,"RE medical bankruptcy-here is how to pay ones bills. (Personal responsibility or lack of) -- May 1, 2017 A big reason so many people wind up in debt over medical issues is that they don't have adequate savings to cover an unexpected cost. According to a recent GoBankingRates survey, 69% of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings, while 34% have no money in the bank whatsoever.  [...] there are things you can do to ramp up your savings, which can help you avoid medical debt ...create a budget ...reduce your spending for all categories that aren't essential living expenses...These include leisure, restaurant meals, and even cable...  If that doesn't do the trick, then you'll need to consider more significant changes, such as downsizing your living space, unloading a vehicle, or working a side job to generate extra income. The key is to save up enough money so you're protected at all times...  www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/01/this-is-the-no-1-reason-americans-file-for-bankrup.aspx

Yes, its encouraged - by groups of other students, by professors, by other forces.

1,"By ancestors of slaves in my comment above, I meant to type offspring. Of course most slaves also had slave ancestors, and most slaves had slave offspring. That is the nightmare of inter-generational slavery. At one point in history, I forget the date, it was estimated that a slave could look 7 generations back and find slave ancestors and with the benefit of a crystal ball, would be able to see 7 generations forward that would also be slaves. No other demographic in America or modern history has been subject to that unspeakable tyranny and inhumanity.  But it didn't end with slavery. Slaves also had """"free"""" offspring and subsequent descendants who were subject to over a century and a half of anti-black discrimination, marginalization, exclusion, and terrorism.  Enough celebration of white supremacy and tyranny. Let's stop erasing descendants of slaves to prop up descendants of white supremacists.

0,"It's a tangent, but I really think the """"bequest boom"""" might be over-stated.  In general, baby boomers are probably going to live longer than their forebears. And this is great news! But health care and general elder care are INCREDIBLY expensive and will probably only become more expensive over time. That is going to eat up a lot of this potential wealth transfer.  I also think that a huge portion of that wealth to be bequeathed, at least in Canada, is related to real estate. I'm not sure how much of it will remain as the social costs from housing unaffordability mount and governments are forced to address the inequities created by their policies in this area.  Though the future will surely continue to bring forth other ways to improve our lives, people might simply have less wealth that needs managing. Maybe financial firms will simply be less relevant long-term.

Literally a season ago there was a wonderful two-part episode that dealt with an alien invasion that was in stark comparison to what radicalized terrorism looks like today. And this season, there was a story that dealt specifically with the impacts of fake news and rewriting history. Also, the show has constantly presented a diverse cast of characters with varied sexual orientation/preferences. Even in the old, old, episodes you can find obvious examples of how Doctor Who is a reflection of their generations. Hell, even the main antagonists the Daleks were created in part to reflect Nazi Germany. I suppose it is possible for this show to be enjoyed on a passive level for entertainment only, but the messages have always been there.

0,"Not uncommon for these muslim fundamentalist types to have criminal histories. Historically those of a criminal bent, psychopaths,sadists, and sociopathic types are often drawn to causes where they can act out their criminal tendencies under the cover of a righteous cause. This was also true for Hitler and his Brown Shirts which later morphed into the SS (Schutzstaffel) and the secret police (Gestapo). This may explain to some extent why groups such as ISIS, Al Queda, Boko Haram, Hamas, PLO, the Moslem Brotherhood, often employ extremely cruel, and sadistic  means of killing their victims.  It is the perfect storm for these individuals, they get their jollies while gaining fame and admirations from their peers.

No collective action by the public leaves an open field to the corporate powers that have all the leverage in power through great wealth and they certainly aren't afraid to use it in our communities, state, nation, or in international trade.  Nothing will bring social collapse to the nation quicker than the 'every man for himself' mentality.   Fortunately, it is human nature to work in cooperative groups.

The GMs job is to mess with chemistry....and assemble the roster based on a myriad of factors. Simmons pick sealed the Raiders game. There have been a lot of mistakes this year -- but Justin Simmons has graded out well on PFF. If anything, having TJ in there, chemistry or not, we'd have been burned by more TE big plays. As he gave up a ton of them last season when he was healthier.  As far as running Wade Phillps out of town. Please. Notice the emotion in that silly phrase. Did he use a pitch fork? His contract was up. He asked for more money. Elway chose to go with a younger option. Oddly, Woods seems to have fixed the run D.

I don't care that some well meaning projects have to be put on the burner for a few years. Shoot, I'm having to do that now because my wants are bigger than my needs. And my needs are bigger than my income stream will allow. What is the governor willing to cut in his administration and in the state government really?  Governor Walker, just list for us those items and their impact. And please give us a plan that continues to shrink government!  Simplify! Simply! Use the electronic Era to computerize functions.

Governments of major nations stopped being one man bands by the 1930s when FDR and other leaders ushered in (for good or bad) the era of very large, complex and all encompassing governments.  Notwithstanding that Trump will continue to be Trump with his tweets and other populist peculiarities, a top notch WH team in tandem with the top notch cabinet that the POTUS has assembled will optimize the performance of this administration.  The good news is that General Kelly has already shown in a very short time that he will indeed be a powerful chief of staff and exercise that power to rid the WH of those who by temperament or talent are not suitable to further the president's agenda with efficiency instead of controversy, to select new people who are up t o the challenge, and provide them with the direction and support they require.

Lets not even talk about the family reunification Liberal vote buying scam.  These immigrants cost us 30 billion dollars a year to support.  Yes they increase the over all GDP but they have and will continue to reduce our GDP per ca pita. So our economy gets bigger but the average Canadian gets poorer.

I wasn't necessarily a fan of the policies of George W. Bush, but for the most part he conducted himself in a """"Presidential manner"""" and I supported him, albeit grudgingly, as my President.

The Australian woman reports a crime and then approaches the police  in their vehicle when they arrive rather than waiting for them to locate her. For many of us, this is simply a mode of behaviour we were brought up to engage in as a sign of respect for police officers whom we don't regard as our enemies. However, for US police officers your approaching them in their car rather than waiting for them to approach you is regarded as potentially threatening behaviour, and that is hardly surprising, given US gun culture, where it is reasonable to assume the civilian might be armed. Unfortunately, Canada and its police are changing toward US norms. Let's hope there is no tragedy involving someone who hasn't adjusted.

My economics textbook would suggest that stimulus spending does not actually boost the economy when it is already on its sustainable growth trajectory so my feeling is they are misguided. Additionally I think their are a lot of pigs who wait at the trough to enrich themselves when stimulus money is deployed. I don't think those pigs necessarily have Liberal view points they are just opportunists and align themselves with Liberals because they usually spend more than Conservatives. I came across an interesting stat the other day that the Gini inequality index typically gets worse under Liberal governments. I have been trying to make rational sense of that ever since.

In my little burg near Albany, the city council, in its infinite wisdom, evidently tried to enact local city sales tax on pot sold with the city limits. The predicable result is that no one who has taken an elementary arithmetic class would dare open a pot store in my community.  I don't know how much of a windfall this will actually yield all these avaricious Oregon government entities but I can't imagine it being the financial panacea they've been hoping for. Someone should let them know that price matters. The black marketers will always be ready, willing and able to  offer cheaper grass because, well, the government allows them to undersell. Pretty simple.  Thus, idea of legal grass putting illegal grass out of business becomes another pie-in-the-sky idea. They should keep the taxes minimal until legal dispensaries capture a majority share of market.

0,"I respect your financial savvy, but there are many valuable members of society who have no such skills or interests yet benefit society as a whole arguably much more than your typical responsible accountant who invests in real estate.  For instance, some doctors, teachers, firefighters, reporters may not have the time to look for investments or the personal interest/education to understand simple investment strategies like using the equity in your home to purchase investment properties and the equity in your investments to purchase more investments.  But our society needs all kinds of people to be able to afford to live in our cities, close to their work, not just those whose hobby or occupation is finance.  For a strong society to exist we need good government policies that don't punish some valuable members just to feed others' greed.  A home within a reasonable commute from work and family is a necessity of life, unlike a vacation property or a luxury car.

0,"National Socialism, more commonly known as Nazism is the ideology and practice associated with the 20th-century German Nazi Party and Nazi state – and, by extension, other far-right groups. Usually characterized as a form of fascism that incorporates scientific racism and antisemitism, Nazism developed out of the influences of Pan-Germanism, the Völkisch German nationalist movement, and the anti-communist Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged during the Weimar Republic after German defeat in World War I.  The term """"National Socialism"""" arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of """"socialism"""", as an alternative to both international socialism and free market capitalism. Nazism rejected the Marxist concept of class struggle, opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and sought to defend the private property and privately owned businesses of Aryans.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism

Secondly pulling a trigger is easy but it's not so simple to gut and cut up adult family members . 2 reasons, it takes too much time, most don't have the stomach for it, someone always gets away or they have a good chance of over powering you in numbers.  Guns are a number eliminator.  Especially a semi automatic.  He can rip through everyone in seconds.  That """"tool"""" is meant to murder and kill.  That's what it does.  That's what it was created for, you can use it to defend your family and yourself but it's intended to end the life of whoever or whatever you point it at.

Then this discretion was taken away and they have to arrest the man regardless of the fact that most of these charges go nowhere and tie up an already burdened court system. He also told us that since the Ghomeshi verdict in Toronto the special interest groups want to make charges against men absolute liability offences.

Following a 1996 cabinet shuffle, she relinquished the Environment portfolio and became Minister of Canadian Heritage.  Copps resigned briefly in the spring of 1996.

I count a few Trump loyalists among family members and acquaintances who are American. In most cases, they have a college degree and had been normal conservatives, voting Republican, for most of their adult lives. In the past 2 yrs, they migrated to Trump and their mindset has made a 180; facts and truth have become the enemy.  Should Trump stick it out and run again, the 48% of the population that voted for him will stick with him and the Electoral College will note that loyalty and push him past the post once again. America has entered the Twilight Zone and Canada, the U.K., France, etc are descending into the same black hole.

I am saddened that the WW would publish a biased and unflattering article that actually says nothing about Stuart's character. Stuart has always been a caring and devoted father who has a close relationship with his son. To say someone once had a heated argument with their teenage son is not news. To lay innuendo on an allegation of a door closing, that never rose to a charge by police, let alone a judgment by a judge or jury of his peers, is disingenuous. Parenting we know is a tough job. Stuart and his former wife have produced an exemplary young man. Stuart has been a tireless advocate for Portland Public Schools, and his son attended a Portland Public High School. Stuart is a tireless advocate for affordable housing and taking the homeless off Portland streets. He's committed to making a Portland a better place for all of its citizens.

0,"If simple engineering sounds like religion to you, then your positions are understandable.  It is true, as ordained by GOD that moving water carries kinetic energy which can be converted via simple electromagnetic mechanisms involving rotating fans and electric induction into clean electric power.  If by design, a river's flow is only partially harvested (as would happen if a downed tree were to become lodged in rocks partially impeding river flow) little substantial impact on the river would derive.  Ordinarily, the energy released by return of water to the sea is dissipated as heat in turbulence as the water gushes here and there and interacts with its bed.  Simple engineering design includes deflective screens to protect fish.  Appropriate placement and spacing protects against slit deposition and accumulation.  Your rejection of such an obvious 24/7 source of energy is amazing.  Look in the mirror and realize that you do not support control of AGW on any terms but your own.

0,"The tradition of patriotism is as strong in American as the tradition of rebellion.  In fact, they have gone hand in hand.  The football players who are disrespecting the symbols of  patriotism are strengthening Trump's support and cutting their own economic throats:   They are employed to entertain an audience that is significantly biased toward patriotism, and so behaving in a manner that appears unpatriotic is not good for their business.  Trump's base of support is also strongly biased toward patriotism, so this works well for him.   In fact, the more unpatriotic the players appear, the better for Trump.    It is, in fact, unifying for those who find unpatriotic behavior offensive, whether they voted for Trump or not.  Russian dezinformatsiya efforts have targeted American class, wealth and race divisions for over half a century.   It those efforts begin to succeed, the fault is not with Americans' tendency to rebel nor with Americans' tendency toward patriotic display.

He was the first person to bring up the notion of our atmosphere being an insulator. At that time, however, they didn't have the technology to test his theory about why our planet was as warm as it is given the distance. He even brought radiation into his theory but ultimately concluded the atmosphere is what retained the heat from that which radiates from the Sun.  In 1859, they were able to test the radiation due to technological advances. It was then that the radioactive properties of the """"greenhouse gasses"""" were successfully measured (they couldn't do it prior to this time).  It was in 1896 or 97 that a Swedish scientist - after further measuring the radioactive properties of the gasses in the atmosphere - theorized, based solely upon math, that fossil fuel combustion would result in global warming and climate change.

0,"“Right now the cost of wind energy is higher than the cost of oil-generated electricity.""""  The key words in this sentence are the first two -- """"right now"""".  That's true at the moment because of a combination of factors.  Wind turbines require a substantial up-front investment due to being new, expensive technology, and the amortized costs are still being passed on to the consumer.  (We saw this with solar too, but now the price is dropping.)  And if a new oil-fired generating plant were to be built here, those costs would also be passed down the line for """"x"""" number of years.  Secondly, the price of oil is currently at a low point in its periodic cycles.  That's mainly due to extraction technologies such as fracking that enable the economic recovery of oil that previously was too difficult to extract.  But oil is a non-renewable resource, so in the long term its cost is inevitably bound to increase.  Thus an investment in renewable-energy technology is a vote for the future.

The DOW gaining over 1,000 in a little over a month borders on the miraculous. Concerned about cost getting out of control on the new Lockheed Martin F-35 jet fighter plane and the new Boeing Air Force One presidential plane, Trump - unlike Obama - called the CEO of Boeing and Lockheed Martin to discuss the cost of the two jet planes.

0,"The statement """"ban all Muslims from entering the United States"""" would certainly describe unconstitutional action IF it meant barring Muslims who are U. S. citizens from entering the U.S. or if it meant barring people with green cards or other valid permission. But there is no constitutional guarantee that allows non-citizens of the U. S. of any racial or religious group entry into the U. S. There may be statutory rights related to  immigration with regard to things like family reunification in some cases, but nothing in the U. S. Constitution.

0,"Health care is outrageously expensive, especially cancer treatment. The pharmaceutical industry is pulling in obscene profits for drugs that mainly treat symptoms but are not designed to cure disease. Natural medicine, alternatively, has many cheaper medicines that actually cure disease without side effects.Some of these have been have been in use around the world for thousands of years, but others have been obliterated, their creators put out of business or even murdered, their records destroyed. We'll never have affordable care until the big pharma giants are forced off their throne and natural cures are allowed to fill in the gaps. It's downright criminal to enable a monopoly to keep filling its pockets with cash by keeping people on dangerous lifetime pain and symptom relievers as their disease slowly kills them. We have traded real freedom for bondage under excessive  govt. control and greedy lovers of money.

Never mind different countries, different cultures, different employment legislation/taxes, selected industries etc.  Ontario's minimum wage has already almost doubled in real terms, and is indexed to inflation.

It's an innocent plant native to North America and many of the Founding Fathers grew it and sold it, usually to make rope for sailing ship rigging but many other products as well. Undoubtedly they learned of it from Native Americans. My 1930 """"Encyclopedia of Horticulture"""" has lots of helpful tips for hemp farmers. American battleships had their decks covered in waterproof sheets made of it.  We passed the Endangered Species Act then formed the Marijuana Eradication Task Force to try to make this native plan go extinct. The western half of the country has legalized ownership of the plant while other regions bust you for having a joint. A considerable number of leading politicians have admitted inhaling, a few have lied about it and some still recoil in horror.

Even if just because taxes will be lower and there will be more opportunity and jobs. Canada will be stuck with the unemployables wanting access to welfare.  Besides the 90 day ban is to figure out how to deal with countries where the passports and other identification documents aren't worth the paper that they are printed on....  This is all smoke and mirrors to give cover to the real changes Trump et al. are pushing through...the gutting of EPA and other regulations, Affordable healthcare act, etc.

But in Hillary's case he whipped out a fast pass- Why?  Bottom line Comey did what he wanted when he wanted. He had more effect on the election than any Russian did.

That insight can also make way for some compassion for the man, tho in his 'tour' in the last diocese, he had no mercy for the elderly devout whom he had no time for, nor for any other than his cohort who either depended on him for a job, or genuflected to him. It ever appeared he was trying to be noticed by the Vat through the prior two popes, both of whom were disgraces regarding sexual intrusion on children by priests and hearing and hearing of it in letters from parents of children and adults who were intruded upon as children-- and yet purposely ignoring the innocent. Yet, those were the ones Chaput was courting.  SOmetimes I wonder if there is anything to the old wives' tale re 'napoleanic complexes. Chaput is a very short man. Very. On the other hand, I've seen the look of some strange grinning ecstacy on his face when he thinks he's recruiting young men for 'a vocation.' His response is eerie imo.

0,"I have first hand experience when Alaskans of the pre pipeline days buy into the John Birch propaganda of the early 70's.  In California attending college 1973 I received a letter from home telling me to find refuge in the hills as the commies were getting ready to take over.  I looked around as I was speeding down the San Fran area freeways and realized  how isolated it can get in Alaska during the winter months.  No one was taking over the USA then or now.  That lesson has stuck with me over the years  that when if you are in Haines or in Sleetmute you may not have very good perspective on how the rest of the country is doing.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that Thomas should be unconcerned -- but 6 years is marketing hooey.  Look for the telltale signs that the tire is degrading -- sidewall cracks, or a vibration that doesn't go away with balancing.  Between a car, a truck, and motorcycles, I have several vehicles, and none of them sees more than 10k per year.  Some of them have tires that are ten years old, and are still quite serviceable.

0,"So instead of getting an education and choosing an in-demand career, the snowflakes insist on following their unprofitable dreams and making responsible people pay their way for them. I went to class. I studied. I did my course work. I got up in the morning and went to work and paid my taxes. Day after day. Year after year. I DID IT. Nobody did a damned thing for me. I got loans and I'm nearly done paying them off. Slackers love pretending 'you didn't build that'. But I damned well did. If you want to be irresponsible and live an unconventional life not chained to the gerbil wheel, that's your right. But YOU pay the consequences.

In other words if he keeps this going to his resorts every wknd, one term could cost taxpayers ~400M.  BO's 8 years cost ~97M.

The Electoral College is much hated by the left because it will not allow the 2 most populous coasts to dictate how the center of the country must be governed. Trump ran the table on the states that Hillary assumed were in the pockets of her pant suit.  The Blue Wall was cracked by Trump in 2016 and because he is keeping his word to those much maligned and abused former middle class people; he may tear down your blue wall next time.

They are the greater threat because they vote, ISIS cannot come to power here. As for Trump, he advocated blocking Muslims from entering the country UNTIL we get a handle on this, and never remotely advocated banning them for life. this is no different than what was done when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.

0,"A complainant is not a victim until the courts rule to that effect.  30 years of gender-politics in sexual assault trials has turned complainants into bonafide victims even before the trials begin.  If feminists can't win the game, they want to change the game.  That is what this is about.  It is not an attempt to create a more honest justice system, it is about slanting the justice system in favour of sexual assault complainants. Justice William Horkins summed up the Ghomeshi trial by concluding that “Courts must guard against applying false stereotypes concerning the expected conduct of sexual assault complainants,” he said. But they must also “be vigilant in avoiding the equally dangerous false assumption that sexual assault complainants are always truthful.”  Truer words were never spoken.  Feminists want to change that.

Johnson  July 11, 2012 An exhaustive study of DNA taken from dozens of Native American groups that span from Canada to the tip of South America is helping to settle a question that has long divided scientists: When people arrived in the Americas more than 15,000 years ago,  The analysis published Wednesday reveals that while one population of “First Americans’’ crossed a land bridge from Siberia during the last Ice Age, giving rise to most Native Americans, there were at least two subsequent migrations. These people mixed with the founding group later, leaving traces of their genes in the DNA of present-day populations in Alaska, Greenland, and Canada.

But, he said, “The level of hate, personal attacks and homophobia is breathtaking.” But he said the institutional church faces a bigger challenge. “The larger question is how will the church deal with trolls? How will the church deal with well-organized and well-funded online sites and individuals which are motivated by hatred, and which seem to have as much influence as local ordinaries in getting a lecture cancelled?

The idiot contributed nothing to public life or the common good. His existence depended on the skill and labor of others; he was a leech sucking the lifeblood from the social body. Related to this, idiocy (from the root idios, 'one’s own') was the state of a private or self-centered person. This contrasted with the status of the public citizen, or polites, such that to be an idiot was to be withdrawn, isolated and selfish, to not participate in the public, political life of the city-state. In Greek society, the condition of idiocy was seen as peculiar and strange (a meaning that is retained in the English word 'idiosyncratic'); thus 'idiot' was a term of reproach and disdain. ...""""

Union donations go to which party.  The payoff, contracts where it is almost impossible to fire an employee, and pay and benefits which are better than the private sector.  When is the last time a teacher was fired? In fact years ago the Teachers union president bragged that none had been fired while he was president, I think his name was Radcliff, but I am not sure.  FDR said public employees should not be in unions, because they can influence the election of their bosses.  This will never change in Hawaii under the Democrat Party  It's a vicious circle. Unions donate and campaign for politicians and in turn politicians give raises and favorable treatment, then the unions give the donations and support again. And the circle goes on.

He had already cut GST by 2% and refused to stop his corporate tax cuts even though they were ineffectual as corporations sat on cash and paid big exec bonuses rather than hiring or investing in soft markets, so his deficits were structural and inevitable. Also, in the early years of Harper's government, he was increasing expenditures at 7% per year.  Harper's last fiscal ended up in deficit.

""""The professional group that needed the most scrupulous accounting for its previous deeds was the judiciary. In 1940's and 1950's and then again in the 1980's it was involved in judicial acts of terror that resulted in thousands of people executed by judicial murder, and perhaps millions being terrorized, losing their jobs and being unable to find another. But the line of judges that were brought to office by Stalinist authorities was allowed to stay, on the premise that 'the group will clean up its act.' It never happened.""""

We can buy what we want from them without a trade agreement and they aren't going to stop buy natural resources and agricultural products because there is no formal agreement. These agreements are all about the wealthy of one country cooperating with the wealthy of another country to strip as much value out of the economy as possible and leave as little as possible in the hands of the average working Joe.  I agree that with current populations the entire world cannot live at our standard of living. The cure for that is to reduce their populations to have a smaller footprint. I would be quite happy with us helping them with that including giving them the technology and education necessary to pull off rising to 1st world standards as they reduce their populations.

Have a professional service check the credit score, criminal background, and litigation before the tribunal. This way you get an objective presentation without possibly being accused of personal interfering with their privacy- it's just business. You can also ask the prospective tenant to pay for this service, and then refund the money once their lease is through. This is an excellent screen.  But that won't tell you everything. Call references. Ask how long they have been employed, how long the ref has known the parties, and so forth. Discrepencies are red flags.  Ask for proof of employment.  If this is their first place, or if they have no credit rating, or from another country, or if they come with their parents, ask for a co-sign.

So while the money follows students, it also COSTS our school district to take on these out-of-district students. The real catch-22 when administrators start chasing those dollars for students choicing in from out-of-district is the temptation to overload classrooms in an attempt to make more money. When a classroom of 20 becomes a classroom of 25, or even 30, it looks pretty darn profitable to an accountant, but I can tell you the quality of education begins to erode rapidly! EVERYTHING in a crowded classroom takes longer, no matter how great the kids or outstanding the teacher. You simply cannot do justice to students in that situation. So, when you allow all these kids to choice in, you are either over-crowding your classrooms or subsidizing their education; and both come at a cost to local students.

Killing and enslaving our animal friends is not longer necessary for the vast majority of us.

0,"Mr. Kawakami, The only vote that matters is the current westside express bus riders, who are expected to be 90% of the projected rail ridership.  Our """"very modern"""" express buses currently go directly to downtown in around 50 minutes and UH in 65 minutes.  Yesterday, my Mililani express took 47 minutes to Alakea.   This morning, I drove my Leaf to Alakea in 28 minutes.  Free parking and free charging.  With rail as it's currently proposed, our AM commute will extend to 90-120 minutes or 4 hours round trip.  Stopping at Middle Street will probably add at least 15-20 minutes to that figure.  It's funny that you all think you can decide what transit option we will use.  Our current express buses take 120 minutes daily.  Driving takes about 90 minutes daily.  Rail will be 240 minutes regardless if UH is in session or not.  It's pretty obvious what the current express bus riders will do when rail becomes the only public transit option.  End rail now.

Falls happen because residents get tired of waiting for assistance and try to do things themselves. Residents can go 2-6 hours at a time without being check on. Google Hospice Kills.

0,"""""Cheaper and more effective ways to produce energy.""""  Let me put it to you this way:  The San Onofree Nuclear Generating Station had 2.2 Gigawatts of Installed Capacity and produced over 16,200,000 MW/hr of Electricity per year, operating at ~91%+ capacity factor.  The Desert Sunlight Solar Plant has 550 MW of installed capacity and produced ~1,200,000 MW/hr of electricity per year. Operating at roughly 25% capacity factor.  The Desert Sunlight facility cost 1.5 Billion Dollars. Two AP-1000 Reactors (1.2 Gigawatts each) costs about 6 Billion. So for installed capacity, their costs are the same. For actual power output, you have to build twelve more (24 billion dollars total for all sixteen) plants of Solar Panels to match the equivalent output of two clean, safe, and reliable nuclear reactors.  That is neither cheaper, nor more effective.

Origin: Nanny state is a conservative term of British origin that conveys a view that a government or its policies are overprotective or interfering unduly with personal choice.

0,"The extracting part is maybe 7% of the problem.  It's the burning part that accounts for about 90% of the remaining 93%, and that is not an oil sands problem.  That is where flying 300 officials to a Paris Climate Conference, or using helicopters to get an overview of the oil sands or across to a private island in the Bahamas, really stands out as flagrantly abusive.  So the real problem is Justin Trudeau, a mental lightweight, but a fossil fuel using heavyweight.

0,"Mr. Martin is not taking into account a new phenomenon in US politics when he opines over the fate of the Democrats and Clinton. Social media arrived with a bang during the past US election.  RC mastered it while the Democrats ignored it. The results speak for themselves. However, this was not necessarily a mistake by the Democrats.  RC's use of social media reveals a serious weakness in it, a weakness that will likely be addressed by the next election.  I expect to see strong controls placed on all social media during future elections including rules limiting political advertising and foreign influence. This will go well beyond transparency. Rules will likely be similar to those imposed on conventional media. Nevertheless social media will continue to dominate.  The Democrats can argue policy all they want but if they give the Republicans the social media advantage in the next election they will loose again.

"
0,"Ok, if you insist (since you obviously have no intention of moving on). My position is based on logic. Character is defined as """"the mental and moral qualities distinctive to an individual"""". Therefore, if someone steals things, that makes him/her a thief. Their moral qualities (ie character) are that of a thief. But I am not advocating for locking someone up based on his/her character or moral qualities. I am stating that their ACTIONS (ie stealing) are against the law and for THEIR ACTIONS they should spend a period of time in jail. During the time they spend incarcerated for STEALING, they cannot continue to steal. Therefore any potential theft during that time period will be prevented. Is that prevention the reason for locking them away from society? No. Their already committed crimes are. But there is the added bonus that they won't continue to steal while incarcerated. That's called following the logic.
"
0,"Assigning """"lower moral gravity"""" is purely an extreme rightist machination. No sanctioned Church source has ever set forth this argument.

0,"NFP is not a burden on women. It is a tool to be used by the woman and MAN. NFP babies are a result of only one of two things. Poor observation (because it is very scientific), or more likely, lack of self control (but it's easier to blame NFP). Regardless of why there is a failure in the NFP process, the child is still a gift from God. I don't really care if a child was """"wanted"""" or not. That is such a trivial matter. I didn't """"want"""" half the food my mother put in front of me, but I am sure blessed to have received it.  Have people forgotten what sex is?  Lets keep in mind that most statistical failures of NFP are a result of a broad definition. The medical community classifies any sex without contraceptives as NFP. When appropriately measured, NFP has an incredibly low failure rate. (equal to or better than most efficient contraceptives)

0,"Chris: that is because every creditor except the new buyers will likely receive Zero dollars. The new guys are smartly taking advantage of the bankruptcy laws and should anyone else want to bid on the paper they will have to pay them the million. The paper's had no assets except for a broken press. No real property, nothing. So they will be able to buy the paper for the value of their loan. Who will bid against them. Probably no one. But they will have to raise several million to get the paper on a profitable  track. It is almost unbelievable that Alice Rogoff bought this paper for over thirty million,  sold the building for around 14 million and had no debt service on any of it, yet managed to run it into bankruptcy. No debt service on the 30 million and she couldn't make it profitable. Hopefully the new owners will, by  providing news that is unbiased.  This might  increase circulation enough to make it pay.

Also, Oregon is now seen as a very desirable place to live by people across the USA who are thinking of moving, due to economic decline in their regions.

I understand the concepts of self ownership and free will but since we are talking about human beings and all that entails, how do you ensure social equality?  You identify with libertarian socialism more than most schools and you state that makes you just to the left of center. In everything I have learned and common sense tells me that socialism is far to the left, more like fringe left, out there with communism and fascism. While libertarian is to the fringe right. Socialism and communism are very authoritarian and libertarian is very anti-authoritarian.  What you are attempting to explain to me sounds like someone attempting to convince me or yourself that down is up and vice versa. It just does not make sense to me and wonder if it makes sense to others like Roy Anthony or Richard Corbell.

0,"@Joe and FoodSupply - Already happened. Pfizer secretly developed and tested Testiculo with the hope of curing the ailment you refer to. It showed great promise in the lab, but human subjects demonstrated dramatically decreased ability to think rationally and to take responsibility for their own actions. This left them extremely vulnerable to conspiracy theories, and fostered an unshakeable belief that facts are irrelevant obstacles to honest debate.  Test Group I banded together to form Oath Keepers.  Test Group II travelled to Oregon and took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.  Test Group III subjects were elected to the Alaska Legislature. This group was particularly volatile, as a number of key individuals had unknowingly been placed under the Imperious Curse by an unknown oil company.  Pfizer is feverishly working on an antidote to minimize the public relations nightmare sure to follow if this information is made public.  It is tentatively named IncumbentNo.

It is extremely galling to go just up the road to Hermanus and find they've been doing the latter for years and don't have a problem! It's getting to the point where the only good thing to say about the DA government is that 'they aren't the ANC' as they've dropped the ball completely. Fair enough, government employees the world over are never the sharpest knives in the drawer, but they really have stuffed up here, when you might have hoped they'd have been a bit brighter. We're in Level 4 restrictions now, which basically means each of us can only use a hundred litres of water a day. Ridiculous. And no rain on the horizon. And El Niño looms once again.

FEMA barred search and rescue efforts for days after the hurricane left.  Federal, state & local law enforcement agencies of the SE states were ready to respond before the hurricane hit & started towards or were already in NOLA the day after it hit. LEOs from around the country were also on their way.  FEMA immediately put out a stand down order to all federal law enforcement until FEMA decided it was safe to enter NOLA.  FEMA also claimed that those LEOs from the gulf states don't know the immediate needs of persons/cities that were hit by hurricanes.  DUH!  Our purpose Was search, rescue & to make the city safe.  NOPD had very few officers left to aid in this effort due to being stranded, killed, or just fled the city in the midst of the damage and chaos. & who knows more about the needs of hurricane victims than those who survived numerous of them.

Every attempt to trip, stop, or confuse was/is tried at every turn in the construction of the rules. Yes, had they done as Oregon did in the very beginning of the Medical Marijuana initiative, Alaska would have seen much more revenue. When Oregon legalized Medical Marijuana, they let industry build on it. Alaska stuffed it into the closet, ignoring every aspect of it.

Once they become aware of Singh's religiously-based conservative social views, I don't think voters in the rest of Canada will warm up to a politician who lets his religion influence his policy positions. Even Harper had to keep his party's Christian social conservatives under wraps in order to obtain and hold onto power. This has little or nothing to do with xenophobia. Instead, it reflects a broad social consensus in this country that religion has no place in the country's legislatures.

I have to admit, it is the first time that I am reading about this film. As something that might serve as in introduction in the history of that crime, it perhaps may pass. However, it should be good as a film, in the first place. Otherwise, it might remain a piece of propaganda which Russia could easily dismiss.

0,"Withdrawing from the TPP might be something his supporters voted for, but how does it help the USA to deny federal funding to NGOs who provide some abortions within the broader program of family planning OUTSIDE of the USA? Looking at millions of desperate, sometimes uneducated & malnourished, refugees trying to flee all those far-off territorial disputes spawned by over-population and dwindling resources, I would think the US would want to help with birth control, family planning and education -- particularly when western nations cannot absorb all of them 'after the fact'.

0,"The Ontario-Quebec deal is to ship the excess power that Ontario can produce during sunny and windy days to Quebec. Quebec will use this power which allows it to store water in its huge dams. This gives Ontario Hydro credit that it can use to buy power at night or when the wind  doesn't  blow or the sun doesn't shine. That is why there is not a specific price for Hydro bought from Quebec. The cost of wind power is not the reason for high power charges. It has been stated repeatedly in the US that coal power will not come back because wind power and solar power are cheaper than electricity produced by gas. The Globe should do more research before they approve an article.

But my hero, Jesus, looks at this mess, and he tips over the tables, he cracks his whip, the money changers run away, those evil men trying to keep the people from their simple sacrifice, those power-hungry keepers of the temple court, find they are no match for the purity and nobility of my Jesus. And the people come inside, the children are blessed and the mothers are recognized. My Jesus is on the side of the people called to serve. Not on the side of those keeping them from serving.

Being short duration it does not contain all that much actual power. And the coupling efficiency into conductors is not all that high.

Bumpings of revenue passengers to make room for them occurred before boarding without bumped passengers knowing the actual reason.

It is why I am totally pissed at the three RINOs that screwed up the opportunity to actually get a bipartisan plan. The bill passed by the Senate was never going to be the law of land and the 49 senators that voted for it, knew that.

A drop in the bucket, but it all adds up to this sea of red ink that really bad judgment accumulates. Why is the same attitude towards saving the taxpayer money not applied always? Surely if they didn't really need that $10k for park bench maintenance they could have used it better for more fundamental needs, like fuel for cop cars. These are not stupid people but they are not wise.

Of course he has been the highest in Canada averaging 60% (now around 50%) because he hasn't been compared to any established party leader for any length of time. That being said his numbers have been declining  +10% over the last year being compared to no other party leader which doesn't bode well for him.

The notion that Clinton had negative things to say about the victim comes from an affidavit in which Clinton did cite expert opinion about how victims in similar situation can be unreliable--the negativity was generic and not about this victim. It was just the hypothetical possibilities  that justify the evidence request supported by the affidavit.

Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea are among the last few.  Considering we import significant oil into the US, exporting internationally seems unlikely, except maybe in some cases of logistical ease.

He replies,  for the first time heard  on the screen,  the words   """"Bond, - lights a cigarette, looks up - James Bond""""  Everyone in the audience gasped and knew they were seeing something different 2) Ursula Andress coming out of the water singing   What a an angel.

0,"Members of the church hierarchy fail to understand the underpinnings of the foundation of this country. They want protection from the homosexual """"marriage"""" ruling, they don't want to be forced to pay for contraception and abortion, and yet they are very happy to receive largesse from the Federal Gov't. Once the Church makes a deal with the Devil (Federal Gov't), they will live and die with the consequences of that choice. They can't have it both ways.  A weak Federal Gov't was envisioned by our Founders, with most power residing at the State level, or with the People.  Other than to stabilize an immigrant who happens to be on our soil, non-citizens do not have a right beyond that.

How many voted for Sen. Giessel, Mackinnon, Miciche, Meyer, reps Hawker and all the rest of them who voted to reduce the states share of oil revenues to nearly nothing  so that our state is in this pickle?  How many fell for the oil company radio and TV advertising blitz promising bigger dividends and a full pipeline and voted NO on 1?  You can't just divorce the consequences of who you elect to office then blame the president of the university. These legislators and the former governor gave the farm away to the oil companies and the chickens have now come home to roost.  This, along with the cutting in half of the PFD is the result.  Before everyone piles on about the """"super low"""" price of oil being to blame, the state and the university and the permanent fund were built with cheaper oil than we have now.

There are several NK ballistic missiles that could reach Okinawa so perhaps an ABM system that worked might be welcome.  However the idea that North Korea is somehow going to build a Navy that can transport the millions of troops necessary to invade Okinawa is laughable.  You dismiss the protests as """"left-wing"""".  When the governments of the world are all """"right-wing"""", then, of course, the protests against those governments will be depicted as being from the other side of the political spectrum.  The protests on Okinawa are not against the location of the US base, but over the fact that the US is there at all.  The businesses outside the gate are often run by criminal organizations that corrupt American Youth.  Okinawa doesn't want the Americans there, Japan does so they won't be on the main islands.

Services employment was flat as a jump in education services, likely reflecting shifting hiring patterns for teachers, was offset by a pullback in culture and recreation employment. - From RBC's Daily Economic Update

Americanism is the belief that our Nation was founded upon something more than simply an idea, or ideology, but a path that allowed an individual, ANY individual, to succeed within this Nation through ambition, hard work, and yes, optimism.  It took a while to get there, to be sure, but it was happening, with actual progress.  And said Americanism was making great strides after the Civil War, until it hit a roadblock, within the name of Woodrow Wilson, the """"Father"""" of the progressive movement.  All equality progress stopped, why, one would wonder, as the term progressive means moving forward, no?  Actually, no, it did not.  Not within the minds of Woodrow's progressive movement, it did not.  Said movement was to take control back from those that they had formerly enslaved by taking away their new found freedoms, and making them reliant upon Government programs, subservient once again.

Terrorism is used to force a society to change its ways, starting with how it deals with freedom of movement, speech and association. People who are afraid demand that government DO SOMETHING and are willing to give up their own freedoms in order to make sure everyone else is controlled. And, yes, they will say """"If you have nothing to hide"""" as if that is somehow a criteria for whether a freedom is allowed to be exercised.  Since you didn't say it clearly enough, I'll reiterate for folks - Our own government has become a terrorist organization with the consent of some of our fellow citizens. We have to STOP it!

The cheapest way to health insurance for all is some kind of universal state-wide or regional coverage where EVERYONE pays something,  and costs can be brought down by the sheer power of numbers, as well as no more need to make a profit, as insurance companies must.

0,"The North Koreans can get a bomb in  through US boarders if they chose to, probably through a poorly secured port.   If we sow the seeds of horrendous death on Korea, our nation will have no security from their anguish and they will seek revenge.    Knowing this does not mean that some people would still prefer this choice now, rather than living in fear of a nuclear Korea.  Interestingly I listened to an NPR report on India's discussion of whether to use nuclear weapons to demolish Pakistan.      They had calculated the millions of lives lost and still there were those that said it was a high price to pay but survivable and worth it to be rid of their nemesis.     They made the choice not to attack Pakistan with nukes.  There will be that argument in the Trump administration.   There is the attraction of 'winning a war' in the immediate future while North Korea is no match for US power.    It's not reassuring to have the reactionary and unpredictable Trump in the discussion.

You can use the force of government to limit the prices of drugs, and therefore limit their profits, but then investors leave and future drug R&D goes away.  Same for medical devices.  The problem with ACA is that it tries to force an """"insurance"""" model onto a bunch of things that are not insurable. Your homeowner's insurance wouldn't cover fire damage if they knew you would set your house on fire in the next several years (at least not affordably). Well it doesn't make sense to force health insurance companies to provide maternity care to women in their 20's. Same for things like drug rehab.  The insurance model works for things that are unlikely to occur and too expensive to pay for out of pocket. If you force companies to cover every medical expense under the sun, you end up with a pay ahead program, not health insurance. The result is prohibitively expensive deductibles and rising premiums.

There's less likelihood of local favoritism that way, too, with one bureaucracy making all the calls as to fault, and accountable in case of results being appealed. With one specialized squad covering all incidents experience-levels would increase and training costs would come down. Let the local cops, including park rangers, if necessary within the park, make the stops, but turn over investigations to one overall group of specialists. What """"local needs"""" do you perceive? Why should establishing fault in an accident differ from one community or locale to another? Local control implies local influence, so that if you're locally connected to law enforcement you might get special consideration. If you want local control then why stop there? Make local cops responsible for securities and exchange violations in their community and plane crashes as well. Forget the FAA.

Both the population and take of wolves in 20C, the Stampede area just north of Denali, has been low for years now, evidenced by census and by actual sealing data.  Easing of the hunting/trapping pressure on wolves in this area is not likely to release a plague of wolves threatening the hunting resource.....that is what the data show.  However, because the hunting/trapping season is so long, key family members are likely to be taken during the denning season, creating an impact on those wolves that breed in the park and travel out into 20C. Disruption of packs is a predictable result, affecting the resource beyond simple numbers.

0,"Dimples82,  Arguably, you are underestimating the effect that a legislated schedule of annual carbon tax rates increases (revenue neutral & progressive through rebates geared to low-income consumers). These rates can start at modest levels & needn't increase dramatically each year because the fact that  (a) the tax applies to every carbon emission related purchase, &  (b) it is clear to all consumers, marketers & producers of carbon emission related products that over a few years the accumulated cost of these products will increase significantly unless emissions are reduced,  will be a constant incentive to purchase, market & produce improved products from a carbon emission standpoint.  There's no need to jump to a $200 per ton rate cold turkey & the goal is for the marketplace to induce us all to avoid the impact of the tax by changes over time in the products consumed, marketed and produced.

The manner of their living, rules, order, and everything have to do with the proper upkeep of their home - living environment & livelihood of their child (well being.)  The Church posits, however that we have a conscience, to be well informed. A child's conscience to decide what he or she thinks is good for themselves (i.e. their own conscience telling them) would deride a parent from making moral good decisions and choices for taking care of their children. And, demands which builds the child's character in taking moral responsibility for doing the right thing. Hence, the Church expresses not to engage in same sex attraction.

We know that ecosystem stability is important for both local and global environmental stability. The BLM area is not just one big sameness but a collection of microenvironments so management is a complex processes. That management does not mean no usage but a carefully planned usage depending on the microenvironments.  For example, this system has been disrupted by removal of bison whose effects are not replaced by deer and antelope. The replacement is cattle but cattle are not bison so the numbers, distribution, and timing need to be determined to help maintain the ecosystem. The agreements were to allow usage based on understanding of impacts not just untouched wilderness.

One of the great things about Catholicism is that most Catholics, even many priests, be they conservative or liberal, have an earthy appreciation for the vagaries of the human condition and a great tolerance for people who are plugging along, doing the best they can.  And that's most of us, gay, straight or whatever.  The great gift you've given your family is that you let them know who you really are; and their gift to you is that they let you know that they love you as you are.  And God sees that it is good.

Significant elements of both the political Left and the political Right (each of its own separate reasons) in that State gave tacit support to illegal immigration over several decades.

The problems with public K to 12 education in California can largely be laid at the feet if the outcome of the Proposition 12 Referendum of a couple of decades ago.  By capping funding for such education rather than finding a more equitable way of funding education as the demand continues to grow, that outcome starved the public education system which then proceeded to fall from first place in national ranking to at or near last place.

Hospitals in Alaska charge ridiculous fees with unbelievable mark up of supplies. Facility fees are a goldmine for all the hospitals and surgery centers. No wonder surgery centers, owned by specialists have cropped up, not only in this in this State but nationwide. Orthopedists have their own surgery center and MRI's, Gastroenterologists have their own procedure facilities (Alaska Digestive Center) and the Surgeons use Surgery Center for elective surgeries. Lets not forget the Insurance and Hospital CEO's compensations e.g. Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini: $15 M, Cigna CEO David Cordani: $14.5 M http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/top-health-insurance-ceo-pay-exceeds-10-million-2014.

0,"Besides the """"horrible"""" conditions these girls experienced, they should be evaluated for cognitive, social and emotional deficits.  Just the fact that they felt they couldn't leave and seek help says volumes about their lack of self esteem and the resulting learned helplessness.  That they didn't know their address is also telling.  Children can be fed, clothed and sheltered well, taken to the doctor, not beaten and sent to school and still suffer from emotional neglect that might require years of therapy to mitigate.  Even the children themselves may not understand what went wrong in their lives.  But as grown ups, problems in relationships and in their own feelings will shout about """"something"""" being wrong.  It's called benign neglect.  So these poor girls have experienced both active and benign neglect which will take a great deal of kind, thoughtful help to begin to correct.  New laws must be crafted to address what isn't an entirely isolated incident.  Kerosene fumes are not benign

0,"Alright, Always There, let's take your logic and make all kids home-schooled. The first ramification of this is that it is not feasible or logical. You mentioned that parents use schools as a 'babysitting service', and while this may be true to a certain extent, a parent isn't going to drop a job just to make sure their student receives at-home education. Doing so could result in a couple things: 1) Maybe the other spouse makes enough money to support the family. Good for them, that's great. Not all families -- in fact most -- can afford this. 2) Having one parent at home drastically cuts the wages of each household and forces them on more government aid, exacerbating a system of welfare and poverty.  Home schooling is great. I believe it is an excellent method of education, but only if it can be economically achieved by the population. You cannot, however, ask families to make an unprecedented sacrifice in wages just to have a child receive an education at home.

One thing that I do question however is whether NAFTA and the end of supply management will actually be detrimental to Canada's dairy farmers.  The reason is that I remember so clearly all the dire predictions about the demise of the Canadian wine industry under NAFTA and the fact that what actually happened was the opposite.  The industry has grown and improved and is now thriving, including selling plenty of great wine to the US. Canadian farmers should plan for the end of supply management and determine how they can compete.  It's possible that they might end up the winners.  If I were in their position, I certainly wouldn't sell the farm.

0,"There are 70,000 Alaskans who earn over $100,000 a year.   I think it`s fair to ask them and the rest of us on lesser incomes as well, to pay a fair progressive share of taxes to get this state on a steady and predictable fiscal path and away from nebulous dependence on the price of oil to plan our budgeting.  People will leave people will stay and new people will come.  Every five years 80% of the population rotates in and out of the state I once heard.  The glut of fracked oil will mitigate any upward pressure on oil prices at these levels for many years (barring general war in the sandbox).  Spreading the tax base away from oil is vital to this state in the current fiscal reality.  It`s time we picked up the slack and helped our state just like almost every single state in the Union.  Development of our infrastructure will continue but far slower and with increased risk of engineering failure (witness Anchorage City Dock..), unless we act responsibly. Just my old two cents.

Senior officials should not have known that Trump might have been turned by Russian agents? How could it not be a matter of importance that Trump is linked to Russian agents? To say that Trump's name might have been improperly unmasked is a stunning defense gambit. It's akin to arguing that Yes, Trump was in contact with Russian agents, but it was supposed to be a secret. That's probably not a strong defense, and Trump shouldn't count on it when impeachment time rolls around.

My point was, and by using the term virtue signalling I was alluding to the fact that they're just words and without action they are pandering only. Mr. Trudeau has done this on a number of occasions. He leaves a meeting in Africa where he has been advising leaders there on LGBT rights and goes to the podium to praise Castro of all people (no friend to that community). He travels to the Paris Climate conference and flies a delegation of 400 to discuss the danger of CO2 emissions. Recently he is critical of the 'wealthy' for avoiding taxes and yet has his wealth hidden away in numbered holding companies. Why? If he would release his tax returns to show he is paying what he calls his 'fair share', I might look on his proposals more positively.

The intriguing reference to the 'Company of Death' turns out to be an abbreviation for the 'Compagnia della Morte degli Ebrei' - which was the organisation which managed and operated the Jewish cemetery.

0,"Answer for you, Joe:  1.  One of the reasons people started building dams in the first place was for flood control.  Given that the Big Su floods from time to time, a controlled release of water from the Watana tributary would tend to control future flooding, which would also help maintain a constant water flow for spawning salmon and their redds thus improving survivability.  2.  The Watana dam would improvement per #1 above.  I would think that lake trout and greyling fishing in the new lake would be spectacular after a number of years.  3.  CIRI owns the lands the new Watana lake will occupy.  They aren't letting anyone hunt up there to the best of my knowledge, but a new lake would allow water access to a lot of lands not currently accessibly by any other technique than airdrop or helo, so I would say that hunting access would also improve a bit.  4.  Final minor detail is a dam producing half of required electricity for the Railbelt.  Sounds like a good tradeoff.  Cheers -

0,"We have a good debate for ranked voting going here.    Ranked voting allows you to 'order' your preference of candidates.    In this case, since it's Hillary supporters who seem most worried about Johnson, you might guess she is preferred over Trump as an alternative choice.  In ranked voting, if a 50% vote is not received by any candidate, the computer tosses out the candidate with the least votes, finds those voters that had them ranked first, applies their second choice, and recounts.  What's good for third parties is that they show their support level in round one because voters do not have to fear they are throwing their vote away for a spoiler.    (Their vote still counts, just using their second choice).  It's a very good way for third parties to show their real support!   They can win primaries, in theory, if they have broad support, say being the second choice on a majority of ballots.  Take a look at ranked voting LFS, it is good choice for third parties.

And the verse they use is a poor motivation for helping the poor - So we are supposed to give in order to get ? I do realize there is a balance as some cannot provide for themselves and therefore must be provided for. Most homeless people I see are clearly taking advantage of others generosity, and it must stop. Catholic groups also emphasize giving and works as a way of entering into Heaven, Christ is the only a person can gain access to Heaven.

First, it was part of a greater plan by the US to acquire property. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 paid France 3 cents per acre however the US Govt did have treaties with most of the tribes inhabiting the land. Not that they saw any remuneration! The Gadsden Purchase of 1853 of Mexican land for building a railroad went to the Mexican hefes, not the campesino. It was what governments did in those days. Not saying it was right or wrong, just that it was what it was. Second, I had a conversation about this very topic just yesterday. I have a sense of how Aleuts view the topic but I found a great paper written by Iġġiaġruk, William Hensley: http://www.alaskool.org/projects/ancsa/wlh/WLH66_3.htm Let's keep talking about this, get our history straight and heal any hurts.

A system designed by slave-owners to protect their property at a time when property included wives, children and anybody of a darkish skintone - cannot possibly be considered liberal. It fails to protect the rights and liberties of all those people because it was SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to ensure they would never HAVE rights.  To give them rights - we had to CHANGE the system, and that process is very far from complete.  We had to destroy a property right to abolish slavery. We had to destroy a property right to redefine marriage into something where women are not bought and sold. We had to destroy a property right to declare that you cannot sell your kids into labour or beat them to death.  Classic liberalism is just nostaligically trying to recreate oppression by subscribing to a system that thought liberty was the exclusive preserve of white men.

0,"In actuality it IS a treaty and has been treated as such by most other nations.  Obama didn't do that because our laws require 2/3 Congressional approval.  That's the first problem - he tried to get around approval by representatives of the people for a treaty that does indeed impact our economy & our laws.  The second problem with this thing is that IF everyone does what they say they are going to do when they say they're going to do it (a huge if) the reduction in warming is predicted to be 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2100 as a result (0.2 C beyond other climate agreements).  Given the past inaccuracy of predictions in this field, who knows if this agreement is worth the trouble?  The outrage seems more about the symbolism than the substance of the US pulling out.  We can still do the reductions committed to, right? The other countries can do the reductions they committed to, right?  If it's more """"how it looks"""" that we pull out, that's not a valid complaint.

Fluoridation costs less than $1 per person, per year.  Fluoride rinse could cost as much as $1 per person, per day, or more.  4.  You have no idea what the “mostly older people” of your community want.  5.  What you believe to be an effective means of exposure of the human dentition to fluoride is irrelevant.  You have no qualifications to make such an assessment.  6.  Educational efforts on oral hygiene have been ongoing for decades, and will contunue to be so.  These efforts are not meant to be in place of fluoridation, but to work alongside it in order to combat the overwhelming problem of untreated dental decay in this country.  7.  There are no drugs involved in fluoridation.  There are simply fluoride ions, identical to those which have always existed in water.  Steven D. Slott, DDS

It is customary for scientists to count only individual, unique references, and not count duplicate referrals to the same reference – which is a good way to inflate the numbers. There are not “1,200 references (over 80 pages)” as anyone who reads the book can easily discover. The majority of those “references” are not to legitimate scientific research anyway.  This book of fiction was published in 2010, so it hardly qualifies as current work in any case.

There is just one aspect of your piece that gives me pause: the vision of everyone being educated and working from their homes.  One of the problems evident in the world today is a growing lack of social cohesion, the understanding that we are all a part of a community and the experience of participating in vital communal experiences.  My assumption is that this is not an either/or issue: that people will welcome being able to spend more time at home, but will still crave the experience of learning and working together.

0,"Ten years ago, I heard a much-quoted canon lawyer (priest) state that realistically Canon Law is whatever the bishop says it is. I wonder whether this use of the title """"pastoral administrator"""" rather than """"pastor"""" is a way around rights and restrictions in Canon Law. If the United States has 197 archdioceses and dioceses, I wonder how many ordinaries are using this administrator title excessively. ---- When the Archdiocese of New York merged and """"closed"""" parishes in August, 2015, quite a few mere administrators were appointed. Upon hearing just a few stories about administrators who were bad fits, I wondered whether the Cardinal Archbishop was not only short priests but also (hate to say it) short of pastors who could get along with the active groups of parishioners. To put it another way, to what extent is this tactic a way of bullying priests into submission, or a realization that pastoral talent is in short supply?

I kept my animals treated for both ticks and fleas and continued to do so for a while after we got here just to make sure they were no survivors. I don't know why others can't/won't do the same. Hopefully this winter will be a good cold one so we can hit the reset button a bit on this thing.  Guess I should start treating my dogs and cats now.  I tell people who are moving to the Lower 48 with their animals to go ahead and start treating them for fleas and ticks now before they leave because if their animals have never been exposed to them they will drive their pets crazy.

How will Trump's vision for America's future unfold? Who knows. If he can somehow deliver without unleashing civil anarchy, he may serve another term. After all, Baby Bush as unpopular and unpalatable as he was managed to serve 2 terms. However, if Trump's Libertarianism pulls the US into civil unrest reminiscent of the 60's with numerous factions of society rebelling on a daily basis, if he initiates a global trade/currency war in which there are no winners,in 4 years we may see the way for a Socialist/Bernie.

That leave democrats with an overwhelming majority is some districts, but removes their votes from districts with 'mixed' voting patterns.  District A:    Democrats win 90,000 to 10,000. District B:    Republicans win   60,000 to 40,000.  In the congressional race, it's 1 D, 1 Republican.  The popular vote, (as used in the federal election) is 130,000 D to 7statisticians0,000 R.  It's not hard to see how gerrymandering has influenced the House to be highly Republican while the overall national voting is either close or leaning Democrat.  You can be sure that both Parties have very talented statisticians to calculate the advantages.  Hope that helps.  Drawing districts should not fall in the hands of the majority party.

0,"The biggest problem is that the electrical grid will not handle  a major shift to EV. The grid can handle the current small percentage. It will be a much different story with 90+ % of the vehicles being EV.  First the energy from 100+ million tonnes of oil must now from electrical production. Currently over 30% of our energy consumption comes from oil. We would have to almost double our production from (Nuclear, Hydro, and Renewables). The distribution  would also nearly have to be double and that could include your own electrical panel in many cases. These ignore the problem of the outrageous cost of the batteries, short range. A big issue is carrying around  half of tonne of battery all the time. With gasoline  you are carrying around less than 60 kg on average vs 600kg with electric.  If you were to make a pickup capable of travelling 600km on a single charge most of the capacity would be lost due to the weight of the battery.

The Internet both exacerbates and complicates bullying, and that is new. Regardless of whether the statistics show a rise or a drop, these issues of human meanness and hatred persist. It's incumbent on us all to eliminate it, for the good of our children and our society. We must not only acknowledge it, but learn its root causes and fix them. Maybe there's less bullying, today. Maybe there's more. Either way, it's still a huge problem, and we all know it. We're certainly more aware of it than ever before, and more cognizant of its impact, and that's a good start.

Other presidents have lacked diplomatic skills, but at least they've had sense enough to surround themselves with experienced, levelheaded people with foreign policy savvy.

The other option would have been to position firefighters in the stairwells and to relay the equipment up by hand  rather than having the firefighters individually troop up the stairs with all their stuff.

Second, when you say, """", the """"optimal dose"""" was nearly twice what PA was adding before 2015."""" you are incorrect.  In 2011, the USDPH recommended narrowing the target of fluoride concentration from 0.7-1.2 parts per million, to the lower end of that target, 0.7.  And yes, that narrowing was established in 2015.  However, 0.7 was always a part of that optimal target.  Either you are purposely being deceptive, or you are repeating something you have heard from someone who was being purposely deceptive.

There are pilots and military leaders trained in the US and supporting the US, then switching to the Vietcong, and now friendly to the US. Then the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, we are fighting in Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, and Djibouti. Soon we will be in the war against terrorists in Nigeria and we could be sending more troops to all these places if we grant the request of local US commanders. In everyone of these places, our commanders have told Mattis and McMaster that the Russians are supporting our enemies. In Afghanistan, the Russians have strengthened the Taliban.

0,"On Oahu where infrastructure is readily available and easily accessible, in 2011 the average cost for DHHL to develop a single family residence was $278,750.  $278,750 x 150 is nearly $42M. https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=NATIVEHIHSGBLOCKGRANTS.pdf  Majority DHHL controlled lands are located in rural areas where infrastructure is not readily available so the cost could be double or more.   Infrastructure costs for water, sewer, and electricity, etc. aside, development of roads alone for 350 homes could easily exceed $12M.  As the former Executive Director of the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA), you should understand the costs involved in DHHL developing homes.

None of these is actually true. Demographics experts have made it clear that immigration, unless it is to rise tenfold will do little to address either our aging population or a low birth rate. Several studies have shown there is no evidence of a skills shortage. As for any economic benefits. The Fraser Institute concluded that, given the low economic success of many immigrants, immigration actually is a drag on our economy. If we improved our mix of immigrants that could change, but that would require taking in more Europeans and less people from the middle east and China (Immigration Canada did a study reported on in the Toronto Star which shows the most economically successful immigrants come from Europe, the least, from the M.E. and China.)

0,"bog hog - In fact the RCMP are enforcing the law. Section 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act prohibits charges being laid against people entering the country illegally until their protection claim is decided. The section is part of the immigration law as it is part of an international treaty on refugees from 1951 that Canada has agreed to uphold since 1967.  Are people being arrested by the RCMP for crossing the border illegally? Of course they are. The RCMP then hands them to the CBSA who deals with them according to the immigration law. In some cases people are kept in detention until their claim is decided. Most are released after they have been vetted for identity and criminal records. If they fail their refugee claim, they get removed from Canada. There is no story here, just a lot of misinformation and lack of knowledge about the issue.

Toronto already has the highest commute time in North America. We beat Los Angeles - another poorly designed, sprawling city - last year.

Basic computing and coding skills, and knowing how to use software can lead to more advances, like the development of websites for local craftspeople so they can sell their work online- reaching a global market. A well-planned strategy with the right marketing- including analytics-  can help the entrepreneur reach their goals. I discovered my indigenous roots through genetic testing. Using a kiosk in a nearby museum, I was able to listen to the stories of my ancestors in their own language, which prompted me to research more about my heritage throughout NE Canada.  The whole idea of the digital divide has taken on a new meaning. Important to not only take advantage of technologies but scrutinize theier use. For example, it can be used in health, but only if you believe you can help yourself (Hruska, 2012). The ultimate success of technology requires everyone's input.

There appears to be four options, so I would think the average consumer should be able to find something to their liking/tolerance level.  There was another pre-roll I like, Mini-J's I think, that are 1/4 gram size and come in a tin like Altoids. Personally I like that idea better. I don't find the need to smoke a full gram. And if you're like me and don't smoke a full 1 gram, then your left with a partially burnt joint that you have to put back in the box.

Putin does not want the losses that he would sustain in a Baltic operation. However, N. Korea provides a thorn in America's side that they can control.  Maybe Congress, both the Democrats and the Republicans, can mature enough to support a legitimately elected U.S. President. As far as the media, those clowns are there for our daily enjoyment derived from their moronic comments.  PRESIDEINT TRUMP - MAGA!! Today & 2020!!

The last time I checked immigration was around 300K and emigration mostly to the US 45K p.a. The so called """"white"""" immigration that everyone wishes will not happen in large numbers as say the Swedes, Dutch etc have excellent social programs so why come here ? Even Spaniards, Greeks etc prefer to go Germany than here. So we need to manage with whoever comes and stays here and make it work which could be a tough job as there may not be the opportunities they seek in the big 3 cities and with Canadians too moving to these cities seeking the same. This could lead to under employment and reducing wages in low skill jobs till these immigrants figure out how to move up the value chain. If definitely has led to skews in immigration from South Asia, China and one way maybe is to have country quotas.

0,"The only reason that Quebec can say no to oil and gas exploration on Anticosti Island is the federal government's equalization program.  Because of its weak economy, which is in large part the result of the province's anti-business rules and regulations, Quebec is classified as a """"have-not"""" province.  As a result, this year alone it will receive $11 billion in equalization payments from federal taxpayers.  Meanwhile, B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan are each classified as """"have"""" provinces in large part because of their well-developed oil and gas industries.  Consequently, none of the three will receive any equalization payments. But Quebec is actually behaving rationally. The three western provinces take whatever minimal risks are required to produce oil and gas, while Quebec refuses any development and yet still receives $11 billion in equalization (i.e., welfare) payments annually. For individuals, this is referred to as the """"welfare trap"""", which can also describe Quebec's situation.

Oregon Health Plan benefits alone are life-changing--way beyond any percentage of the 2.5% tax on the less than 1% of companies registered to do business in Oregon they end up paying. Add to that support for public schools and for senior services and you have a vast advantage for the poor in Measure 97.

An interesting note is that, in the 50's people began to be charged different prices for medical procedures based on whether they had insurance.  And that was the beginning of insurance-controlled healthcare costs, and health-care providers who know how to game the system. Republicans were against the ACA from the beginning, denying the original bill hands-down for being too 'socialist', too much like single-payer, bypassed insurance companies and took away too much of their autonomy.   GOP votes were needed to pass the bill, and they insisted in endless tinkering.

Here in Canada, we are seeing more and more taxes and we have a PM who thinks nothing of adding another $130 billion to the national xcdebt while proposing to tax out of existence our largest commodity ( oil and gas ).  And adding more regulations and red tape.  Its increasingly clear that, with these new tax proposals, canada will be placed in a very uncompetitive position for attracting investment capital.  Very little capital is coming in from offshore now, so these much lower tax rates and deregulation in the US will make us much less competitive.  Trillions of capital will now come flowing back to the US  while Trumps tariffs and border tax will take away any benefits of a lower C$.

I think he said Jesus came to show us how to live a good life, not that he died on the cross to show us how to live a good life.  The earliest Jesus followers believed Jesus was the Messiah. Some might make the argument that a suffering Messiah was anticipated by some Jews, but the consensus view, as far as I'm aware, is that the Messiah was expected to be a glorious conquerer and/or a priestly figure, not a figure crushed by imperial oppressors. As you know crucifixion was the most painful, humiliating form of execution practiced by the Romans and generally reserved for slaves and seditionists. Why did the Messiah suffer this fate? The Jesus followers and Paul looked to the scriptures for meaning. Ah! He was wounded for our transgressions...

Another Infowars fake news item could be true-- all the leaked information on Trump is coming from  General McMasters, Trump's National Security Advisor (in some versions he is an Obama, CIA, or Hillary plant).

Rationing can be done by price or availability.  The US has used price (huge profits for doctors etc), while countries like Canada and Europe have used availability (wait in line).  I don't support either system.  I would support a free market system; free of detailed government oversight from top to bottom.

When those people declare war, it is so our people can die for corporate greed! It's the exploitation of a countries resources that drives war and government. Sounds rather gloomy but take a look into the history  of this and all other nations. People are just cannon fodder that allows corporate entities to gain wealth and power. Nothing has changed much from the days of the Monarchies of the world.  We aren't heard by our leaders because to them, we are nothing. I'm not sure that can ever be changed. Trump might turn Washington on it's head, shake some of the junk out of their pockets and even expose some horrible wounds but if he can't put humpty dumpty back together in a more efficient manner, nothing much will change. He can drain the swamp but the alligators aren't going away!

The NRA is NOT concerned about this.

That's where the hikers go, and that's where the labor of upkeep is concentrated. A fee for this special use is appropriate.  When I first started backpacking in designated wilderness in 1972 at the age of 25, I would not see other people for days at a time, and I would have a whole lake filled with trout to myself. I left no trash, no footprint. Now the situation is different, and it is good that so many outdoor enthusiasts see the wonderful mountain sights I was so privileged to see in my youth. However, with the crowd come costs in cleanup and maintenance of trails. Those who can afford a tent and sleeping bag, and a decent backpack and hiking shoes, must also expect to pay a fee for the human wear and tear on trails and popular camping areas.

It will bring billions more dollars into the state economy and increase economic activity around 3% - more than enough to make up for any small increases in the cost of goods for small businesses, which will be at a competitive advantage over the large, multistate retailers who will be actually paying the GRT.  Most importantly, however, it will enable the state to fund education adequately, rather than providing school kids with the shortest school year and largest class sizes in the country.

Certainly this is not an avenue that the Vatican II liturgy document even considers.  What Vatican II did want to use was reliable knowledge about how the early Church celebrated the Eucharist. It is here that place and language are relevant.  As to language, it seems clear that it was celebrated in the language that would be known and understand by the participants.  As to place, it seems clear that initially they used appropriate, but not purpose designed buildings. A key feature of this is that the number of people who gathered for these celebrations was quite small. It is only with the emancipation of the Church under Constantine that you get the phenomenon of great numbers wanting to attend the eucharist and the parallel development of purpose built churches.

The advocate therefore puts before the court the clients version, even if unlikely. Should the clients version however be so unlikely one expect the advocate to confront the client. If the client acknowledge that its version does not represent the truth the advocate would be in breach of his oath to present it to court knowing it is not the truth. In such case there can be no consequence for the advocate refusing to knowingly be party to misleading the court.

Meanwhile, the folks that are, shall we say, less than productive, get their insurance virtually free... thanks to the folks that are trapped into the horrendous payments dumped on those those who actually work for a living. Surely, you can grasp their angst. It would much like you having to contribute $1,500.00 a month to the Republican party, or the NRA, or the right to life groups.  If you get free healthcare, do I get a free Bugatti Veyron to cut my commute times to visit my kid in Phoenix?

0,"in reply to: """"The ethical opposition to universal healthcare is nonexistent"""". The ethical opposition is that we should not judge our nation by how well we treat our poor. It should be judged by how few poor we have. The late Wally Hickel made a profound statement. He said that humans have developed the technology to eliminate poverty from the face of the earth. The only question is how we do that. I do not know if government is the solution. I'm sure it's part of the solution. But I also look at the fact that our capitalist economy has made us one of the wealthiest (and luckiest) bunch of people on the earth. I do not think that gives us the moral upper ground. We still have plenty of poor in our country. But still our nation gives more to poor nations than any other. Our capitalism has allowed us that privilege. But our compassion has inspired us to do so. So that is my moral argument. I am a capitalist for the sole reason that I believe it is most practical solution to end poverty.

1,"More drivel. Jews in Europe are afraid, but they are not afraid of Christians. Not at all. They are leaving France and Belgium and Sweden because of the growing Muslim populations. Hate crimes against Jews are far more problematic in Europe than the cause du jour of the Press, Islamophobia. The populist parties in Europe are pro Jew and anti-Islam. They are the firewalls against increasing anti-Semitism, not the other way around. This stirring up of negativity by Sanders toward populist parties in Europe is predictable and I knew it was only a matter of time before he played the Hitler card. If the Jews are looking for politicians in Europe who have their backs, they need look no further than Oban, LePen in France, Geert Wilders in Holland and Nigel Farage in the UK.

First, the private sector is very guarded about telling anyone what they actually pay, so it is very hard to get good information.   Second, most government jobs are only done by government so it is almost impossible to get a good comparable in the private sector and damnably difficult to get them even in the public sector because the Alaska government does all sorts of things that are either private sector or local government in other jurisdictions.  I think it is fair to say that for a given body of knowledge, skill, and ability, the State significantly overpays at the entry and semi-skilled levels and underpays at the high-level supervisory/managerial level in most jobs at that level.

0,"Chapter 11 establishes a mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes that assures both equal treatment among investors of the Parties to the Agreement in accordance with the principle of international reciprocity and due process before an impartial tribunal. A NAFTA investor who alleges that a host government has breached its investment obligations under Chapter 11 may, at its option, have recourse to one of the following arbitral mechanisms:  the World Bank's International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID); ICSID's Additional Facility Rules; and the rules of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL Rules). Alternatively, the investor may choose the remedies available in the host country's domestic courts. An important feature of the Chapter 11 arbitral provisions is the enforceability in domestic courts of final awards by arbitration tribunals.  Chapter 11 has been repeatedly abused by U.S. multinationals to Canada's detriment

That domestic legislation is enforceable.  As far as reform, the legislation and processes we now have are in place because in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada determined that the lack of an oral hearing for a refugee claimant before an independent tribunal was unconstitutional.  See Singh v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177  Singh determined that any person in Canada even without legal status was protected by the Charter.  That decision was based on section 7 rights to security of person and fundamental justice. The SCOC ruled the government's claim that giving hearing to refugees would be burdensome was too utilitarian a concern, and that administrative convenience would rarely be sufficiently compelling to justify infringing a Charter right.  So good luck getting changes past the courts.

0,"This information is incomplete and at least somewhat misleading.  Yes, you can get toxoplasmosis from raw or undercooked meat.  What it doesn't say is that the reason the meat animal is contaminated is because it ate something that was contaminated with toxoplasma gondii oocysts (egg cells) that were shed in a cat's feces.  Or it ate another animal that ingested oocysts that were shed in a cat's feces.  It also doesn't say that the reason fruits and vegetables need to be washed is because they may have been contaminated with oocysts from cat's feces.  The original source of every single case of toxoplasmosis is cats.  ONLY cats shed the infectious oocysts in their feces.  Whether you contract toxoplasmosis from eating undercooked meat, unwashed produce, or inhaling aerosolized oocysts, the source is cats.  There is no other.  And, it should be noted, the PetMD source quoted is outdated.  Recent research shows most people become infected through  direct ingestion of oocysts.

Another central bank would have had minutes of its meetings and published submissions by its members. No transcripts of Bank of Canada press conferences are ever released. Now they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars renovating their headquarters to make it much less accessible to the Canadian public. Secretiveness, it seems, will increase even in terms of further limiting public access to where our central bankers work.

Personally, I would like to see some tweaks to the system, since large scale change is impossible.     For GP's have minimal standards for patients seen and/or hours worked.     For patients - EVERY patient should see a full invoice or accounting of their yearly use of our socialized system, with associated costs.     Institute a minimal fee per visit (waived in low income cases).    Make patients part of the solution so that they have some skin in the game.  I have too many doctors in my family to have any illusion that they are unfairly burdened, face any more stress, or work any harder than any other professional.   Key word:  """"Professional"""".     Maybe that needs to be taught more in med schools so that this sense of entitlement and binary thinking is minimized.

Don't have to run over as many grandmas trying to pass you on the right as you swing out to the left to turn right.  Last spring, my 68 year old wife and three of her girlfriend (same age) took a trip to Moab in our Grand Cherokee.  A couple of hours after she left, she called me.  She was driving thru Eisenhower Tunnel in the blind spot of an 18-wheeler who changed lanes into her and she had no place to go.  The trucker told the state patrolman that was her fault because she was handing something to the kids in the back seat and not paying attention.  Unforunately for him, the patrolman also talked to the three 68 year old """"kids.""""  But you never want to drive along side an 18-wheeler.

Yet, Mazie says she intends to run for reelection.  If she does and wins, which is almost 100% certain for a Democrat, it is highly unlikely that she will be able to fulfill her duties for another eight years, and will have to resign to take care of her health problems.  When that occurs, her replacement will be selected by the Governor and not by the people of Hawaii.  I believe Mazie should do what is best for the people by serving out her current term and not running for reelection so that the people get to decide her replacement instead of the Old Boy network.

A huge industry has developed of individuals buying, renovating and flipping houses to large profits that they shelter from tax.  Now that the CRA is tracking this more closely, the flippers can expect to pay tax and this significantly reduces or eliminates their profits on the flip when other costs are factored in.  I have seen stats that as much as around 26% of house deals in the GTA are domestic speculators.  This is much bigger than foreign buyers.  On almost every street in or around downtown there are houses undergoing extensive reno's for flipping.

Again, Wills doesn't argue that a conceptus isn't human life, so your scientific argument is moot.  By the way, I disagree with Wills that abortion isn't a religious issue.

Nobody (me included) is ranking the jobs in order of importance and setting wages accordingly. Employers want to pay as little as possible to their employees (I'm sure there are exceptions to this but I'm willing to bet it holds in the majority of cases) so the more qualified applicants there are the lower the wages will have to be. Truck drivers get paid more than ECEs because there is a high demand for their services and few qualified drivers. That's it. I'm not trying to belittle ECE workers, just recognizing the rules of supply and demand.
